THE B-PER
TWO I-PER
POETS I-PER
OF O
SAFFRON B-GPE
PARK I-GPE
THE B-GPE
suburb I-GPE
of I-GPE
Saffron I-GPE
Park I-GPE
lay O
on O
the O
sunset O
side O
of O
London B-GPE
, O
as O
red O
and O
ragged O
as O
a O
cloud O
of O
sunset O
. O
It O
was O
built O
of O
a O
bright O
brick O
throughout O
; O
its O
sky-line O
was O
fantastic O
, O
and O
even O
its O
ground O
plan O
was O
wild O
. O
It O
had O
been O
the O
outburst O
of O
a O
speculative O
builder O
, O
faintly O
tinged O
with O
art O
, O
who O
called O
its O
architecture O
sometimes O
Elizabethan O
and O
sometimes O
Queen O
Anne O
, O
apparently O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
the B-PER
two I-PER
sovereigns I-PER
were O
identical O
. O
It O
was O
described O
with O
some O
justice O
as O
an O
artistic O
colony O
, O
though O
it O
never O
in O
any O
definable O
way O
produced O
any O
art O
. O
But O
although O
its O
pretensions O
to O
be O
an O
intellectual O
centre O
were O
a O
little O
vague O
, O
its O
pretensions O
to O
be O
a B-GPE
pleasant I-GPE
place I-GPE
were O
quite O
indisputable O
. O
The O
stranger O
who O
looked O
for O
the O
first O
time O
at O
the B-FAC
quaint I-FAC
red I-FAC
houses I-FAC
could O
only O
think O
how O
very O
oddly O
shaped O
the B-PER
people I-PER
must O
be O
who O
could O
fit O
in O
to O
them O
. O
Nor O
when O
he O
met O
the B-PER
people I-PER
was O
he O
disappointed O
in O
this O
respect O
. O
The B-GPE
place I-GPE
was O
not O
only O
pleasant O
, O
but O
perfect O
, O
if O
once O
he O
could O
regard O
it O
not O
as O
a O
deception O
but O
rather O
as O
a O
dream O
. O
Even O
if O
the B-PER
people I-PER
were O
not O
“ O
artists B-PER
, O
” O
the O
whole O
was O
nevertheless O
artistic O
. O
That B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
long I-PER
, I-PER
auburn I-PER
hair I-PER
and I-PER
the I-PER
impudent I-PER
face I-PER
-- O
that B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
was O
not O
really O
a B-PER
poet I-PER
; O
but O
surely O
he O
was O
a O
poem O
. O
That B-PER
old I-PER
gentleman I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
wild I-PER
, I-PER
white I-PER
beard I-PER
and I-PER
the I-PER
wild I-PER
, I-PER
white I-PER
hat I-PER
-- O
that B-PER
venerable I-PER
humbug I-PER
was O
not O
really O
a B-PER
philosopher I-PER
; O
but O
at O
least O
he O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
philosophy O
in O
others O
. O
That B-PER
scientific I-PER
gentleman I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
bald I-PER
, I-PER
egg-like I-PER
head I-PER
and I-PER
the I-PER
bare I-PER
, I-PER
bird-like I-PER
neck I-PER
had O
no O
real O
right O
to O
the O
airs O
of O
science O
that O
he O
assumed O
. O
He O
had O
not O
discovered O
anything O
new O
in O
biology O
; O
but O
what O
biological O
creature O
could O
he O
have O
discovered O
more O
singular O
than O
himself O
? O
Thus O
, O
and O
thus O
only O
, O
the B-GPE
whole I-GPE
place I-GPE
had O
properly O
to O
be O
regarded O
; O
it O
had O
to O
be O
considered O
not O
so O
much O
as O
a O
workshop O
for O
artists B-PER
, O
but O
as O
a O
frail O
but O
finished O
work O
of O
art O
. O
A B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
stepped I-PER
into I-PER
its I-PER
social I-PER
atmosphere I-PER
felt O
as O
if O
he O
had O
stepped O
into O
a O
written O
comedy O
. O
More O
especially O
this O
attractive O
unreality O
fell O
upon O
it O
about O
nightfall O
, O
when O
the O
extravagant O
roofs O
were O
dark O
against O
the O
afterglow O
and O
the B-GPE
whole I-GPE
insane I-GPE
village I-GPE
seemed O
as O
separate O
as O
a O
drifting O
cloud O
. O
This O
again O
was O
more O
strongly O
true O
of O
the O
many O
nights O
of O
local O
festivity O
, O
when O
the B-FAC
little I-FAC
gardens I-FAC
were O
often O
illuminated O
, O
and O
the O
big O
Chinese O
lanterns O
glowed O
in O
the O
dwarfish O
trees O
like O
some O
fierce O
and O
monstrous O
fruit O
. O
And O
this O
was O
strongest O
of O
all O
on O
one O
particular O
evening O
, O
still O
vaguely O
remembered O
in O
the O
locality O
, O
of O
which O
the B-PER
auburn-haired I-PER
poet I-PER
was O
the B-PER
hero I-PER
. O
It O
was O
not O
by O
any O
means O
the O
only O
evening O
of O
which O
he O
was O
the B-PER
hero I-PER
. O
On O
many O
nights O
those O
passing O
by O
his B-FAC
little I-FAC
back I-FAC
garden I-FAC
might O
hear O
his O
high O
, O
didactic O
voice O
laying O
down O
the O
law O
to O
men B-PER
and O
particularly O
to O
women B-PER
. O
The O
attitude O
of O
women B-PER
in O
such O
cases O
was O
indeed O
one O
of O
the O
paradoxes O
of O
the B-GPE
place I-GPE
. O
Most O
of O
the B-PER
women I-PER
were O
of O
the O
kind O
vaguely O
called O
emancipated O
, O
and O
professed O
some O
protest O
against O
male O
supremacy O
. O
Yet O
these B-PER
new I-PER
women I-PER
would O
always O
pay O
to O
a B-PER
man I-PER
the O
extravagant O
compliment O
which O
no B-PER
ordinary I-PER
woman I-PER
ever O
pays O
to O
him O
, O
that O
of O
listening O
while O
he O
is O
talking O
. O
And O
Mr. B-PER
Lucian O
Gregory O
, O
the B-PER
red-haired I-PER
poet I-PER
, O
was O
really O
( O
in O
some O
sense O
) O
a B-PER
man I-PER
worth O
listening O
to O
, O
even O
if O
one O
only O
laughed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O
He O
put O
the O
old O
cant O
of O
the O
lawlessness O
of O
art O
and O
the O
art O
of O
lawlessness O
with O
a O
certain O
impudent O
freshness O
which O
gave O
at O
least O
a O
momentary O
pleasure O
. O
He O
was O
helped O
in O
some O
degree O
by O
the O
arresting O
oddity O
of O
his O
appearance O
, O
which O
he O
worked O
, O
as O
the O
phrase O
goes O
, O
for O
all O
it O
was O
worth O
. O
His O
dark O
red O
hair O
parted O
in O
the O
middle O
was O
literally O
like O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
’s O
, O
and O
curved O
into O
the O
slow O
curls O
of O
a B-PER
virgin I-PER
in O
a O
pre-Raphaelite O
picture O
. O
From O
within O
this O
almost O
saintly O
oval O
, O
however O
, O
his O
face O
projected O
suddenly O
broad O
and O
brutal O
, O
the O
chin O
carried O
forward O
with O
a O
look O
of O
cockney O
contempt O
. O
This O
combination O
at O
once O
tickled O
and O
terrified O
the O
nerves O
of O
a O
neurotic O
population O
. O
He O
seemed O
like O
a O
walking O
blasphemy O
, O
a O
blend O
of O
the B-PER
angel I-PER
and O
the O
ape O
. O
This O
particular O
evening O
, O
if O
it O
is O
remembered O
for O
nothing O
else O
, O
will O
be O
remembered O
in O
that B-GPE
place I-GPE
for O
its O
strange O
sunset O
. O
It O
looked O
like O
the O
end O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
All O
the O
heaven O
seemed O
covered O
with O
a O
quite O
vivid O
and O
palpable O
plumage O
; O
you O
could O
only O
say O
that O
the O
sky O
was O
full O
of O
feathers O
, O
and O
of O
feathers O
that O
almost O
brushed O
the O
face O
. O
Across O
the O
great O
part O
of O
the O
dome O
they O
were O
grey O
, O
with O
the O
strangest O
tints O
of O
violet O
and O
mauve O
and O
an O
unnatural O
pink O
or O
pale O
green O
; O
but O
towards O
the O
west O
the O
whole O
grew O
past O
description O
, O
transparent O
and O
passionate O
, O
and O
the O
last O
red-hot O
plumes O
of O
it O
covered O
up O
the O
sun O
like O
something O
too O
good O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
The O
whole O
was O
so O
close O
about O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
, O
as O
to O
express O
nothing O
but O
a O
violent O
secrecy O
. O
The O
very O
empyrean O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
secret O
. O
It O
expressed O
that O
splendid O
smallness O
which O
is O
the O
soul O
of O
local O
patriotism O
. O
The O
very O
sky O
seemed O
small O
. O
I O
say O
that O
there O
are O
some B-PER
inhabitants I-PER
who I-PER
may I-PER
remember I-PER
the I-PER
evening I-PER
if I-PER
only I-PER
by I-PER
that I-PER
oppressive I-PER
sky I-PER
. O
There O
are O
others O
who O
may O
remember O
it O
because O
it O
marked O
the O
first O
appearance O
in O
the B-GPE
place I-GPE
of O
the O
second O
poet O
of O
Saffron B-GPE
Park I-GPE
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
the B-PER
red-haired I-PER
revolutionary I-PER
had O
reigned O
without O
a B-PER
rival I-PER
; O
it O
was O
upon O
the O
night O
of O
the O
sunset O
that O
his O
solitude O
suddenly O
ended O
. O
The O
new O
poet O
, O
who O
introduced O
himself O
by O
the O
name O
of O
Gabriel B-PER
Syme I-PER
was O
a O
very O
mild-looking O
mortal O
, O
with O
a O
fair O
, O
pointed O
beard O
and O
faint O
, O
yellow O
hair O
. O
But O
an O
impression O
grew O
that O
he O
was O
less O
meek O
than O
he O
looked O
. O
He O
signalised O
his O
entrance O
by O
differing O
with O
the B-PER
established I-PER
poet I-PER
, O
Gregory B-PER
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
nature O
of O
poetry O
. O
He O
said O
that O
he O
( O
Syme B-PER
) O
was O
poet B-PER
of I-PER
law I-PER
, O
a B-PER
poet I-PER
of I-PER
order I-PER
; O
nay O
, O
he O
said O
he O
was O
a B-PER
poet I-PER
of I-PER
respectability I-PER
. O
So O
all B-PER
the I-PER
Saffron I-PER
Parkers I-PER
looked O
at O
him O
as O
if O
he O
had O
that O
moment O
fallen O
out O
of O
that O
impossible O
sky O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Lucian O
Gregory O
, O
the B-PER
anarchic I-PER
poet I-PER
, O
connected O
the O
two O
events O
. O
“ O
It O
may O
well O
be O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
in O
his O
sudden O
lyrical O
manner O
, O
“ O
it O
may O
well O
be O
on O
such O
a O
night O
of O
clouds O
and O
cruel O
colours O
that O
there O
is O
brought O
forth O
upon O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
such O
a O
portent O
as O
a B-PER
respectable I-PER
poet I-PER
. O
You O
say O
you O
are O
a B-PER
poet I-PER
of I-PER
law I-PER
; O
I O
say O
you O
are O
a O
contradiction O
in O
terms O
. O
I O
only O
wonder O
there O
were O
not O
comets O
and O
earthquakes O
on O
the O
night O
you O
appeared O
in O
this B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
” O
The B-PER
man I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
meek I-PER
blue I-PER
eyes I-PER
and I-PER
the I-PER
pale I-PER
, I-PER
pointed I-PER
beard I-PER
endured O
these O
thunders O
with O
a O
certain O
submissive O
solemnity O
. O
The O
third O
party O
of O
the B-PER
group I-PER
, O
Gregory B-PER
’s O
sister O
Rosamond B-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
her I-PER
brother I-PER
’s I-PER
braids I-PER
of I-PER
red I-PER
hair I-PER
, I-PER
but I-PER
a I-PER
kindlier I-PER
face I-PER
underneath I-PER
them I-PER
, O
laughed O
with O
such O
mixture O
of O
admiration O
and O
disapproval O
as O
she O
gave O
commonly O
to O
the B-PER
family I-PER
oracle I-PER
. O
Gregory B-PER
resumed O
in O
high O
oratorical O
good O
humour O
. O
“ O
An B-PER
artist I-PER
is O
identical O
with O
an B-PER
anarchist I-PER
, O
” O
he O
cried O
. O
“ O
You O
might O
transpose O
the O
words O
anywhere O
. O
An B-PER
anarchist I-PER
is O
an B-PER
artist I-PER
. O
The B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
throws I-PER
a I-PER
bomb I-PER
is O
an B-PER
artist I-PER
, O
because O
he O
prefers O
a O
great O
moment O
to O
everything O
. O
He O
sees O
how O
much O
more O
valuable O
is O
one O
burst O
of O
blazing O
light O
, O
one O
peal O
of O
perfect O
thunder O
, O
than O
the O
mere O
common O
bodies O
of O
a B-PER
few I-PER
shapeless I-PER
policemen I-PER
. O
An B-PER
artist I-PER
disregards O
all O
governments O
, O
abolishes O
all O
conventions O
. O
The B-PER
poet I-PER
delights O
in O
disorder O
only O
. O
If O
it O
were O
not O
so O
, O
the O
most O
poetical O
thing O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
would O
be O
the O
Underground O
Railway O
. O
” O
“ O
So O
it O
is O
, O
” O
said O
Mr. B-PER
Syme O
. O
“ O
Nonsense O
! O
” O
said O
Gregory B-PER
, O
who O
was O
very O
rational O
when O
anyone B-PER
else I-PER
attempted O
paradox O
. O
“ O
Why O
do O
all B-PER
the I-PER
clerks I-PER
and O
navvies B-PER
in O
the B-VEH
railway I-VEH
trains I-VEH
look O
so O
sad O
and O
tired O
, O
so O
very O
sad O
and O
tired O
? O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
. O
It O
is O
because O
they O
know O
that O
the B-VEH
train I-VEH
is O
going O
right O
. O
It O
is O
because O
they O
know O
that O
whatever O
place O
they O
have O
taken O
a O
ticket O
for O
that O
place O
they O
will O
reach O
. O
It O
is O
because O
after O
they O
have O
passed O
Sloane B-FAC
Square I-FAC
they O
know O
that O
the B-FAC
next I-FAC
station I-FAC
must O
be O
Victoria B-FAC
, O
and O
nothing O
but O
Victoria B-FAC
. O
Oh O
, O
their O
wild O
rapture O
! O
oh O
, O
their O
eyes O
like O
stars O
and O
their O
souls O
again O
in O
Eden B-LOC
, O
if O
the B-FAC
next I-FAC
station I-FAC
were O
unaccountably O
Baker B-FAC
Street I-FAC
! O
” O
“ O
It O
is O
you O
who O
are O
unpoetical O
, O
” O
replied O
the B-PER
poet I-PER
Syme B-PER
. O
“ O
If O
what O
you O
say O
of O
clerks B-PER
is O
true O
, O
they O
can O
only O
be O
as O
prosaic O
as O
your O
poetry O
. O
The O
rare O
, O
strange O
thing O
is O
to O
hit O
the O
mark O
; O
the O
gross O
, O
obvious O
thing O
is O
to O
miss O
it O
. O
We O
feel O
it O
is O
epical O
when O
man B-PER
with I-PER
one I-PER
wild I-PER
arrow I-PER
strikes O
a O
distant O
bird O
. O
Is O
it O
not O
also O
epical O
when O
man B-PER
with I-PER
one I-PER
wild I-PER
engine I-PER
strikes O
a B-FAC
distant I-FAC
station I-FAC
? O
Chaos O
is O
dull O
; O
because O
in O
chaos O
the B-VEH
train I-VEH
might O
indeed O
go O
anywhere O
, O
to O
Baker B-FAC
Street I-FAC
or O
to O
Bagdad B-GPE
. O
But O
man B-PER
is O
a B-PER
magician I-PER
, O
and O
his O
whole O
magic O
is O
in O
this O
, O
that O
he O
does O
say O
Victoria B-GPE
, O
and O
lo O
! O
it O
is O
Victoria B-GPE
. O
No O
, O
take O
your O
books O
of O
mere O
poetry O
and O
prose O
; O
let O
me O
read O
a O
time O
table O
, O
with O
tears O
of O
pride O
. O
Take O
your O
Byron O
, O
who O
commemorates O
the O
defeats O
of O
man B-PER
; O
give O
me O
Bradshaw B-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
commemorates I-PER
his I-PER
victories I-PER
. O
Give O
me O
Bradshaw B-PER
, O
I O
say O
! O
” O
“ O
Must O
you O
go O
? O
” O
inquired O
Gregory B-PER
sarcastically O
. O
“ O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
” O
went O
on O
Syme B-PER
with O
passion O
, O
“ O
that O
every O
time O
a B-VEH
train I-VEH
comes O
in O
I O
feel O
that O
it O
has O
broken O
past O
batteries O
of O
besiegers B-PER
, O
and O
that B-PER
man I-PER
has O
won O
a O
battle O
against O
chaos O
. O
You O
say O
contemptuously O
that O
when O
one O
has O
left O
Sloane B-FAC
Square I-FAC
one O
must O
come O
to O
Victoria B-FAC
. O
I O
say O
that O
one O
might O
do O
a O
thousand O
things O
instead O
, O
and O
that O
whenever O
I O
really O
come O
there B-FAC
I O
have O
the O

a O

. O
“ O

even O

he O
said O

“ O

waiting O

were O
grouped O
around O
the O
open O
door O
of O
the B-FAC

, O
gossiping O
idly O
of O

purely O
local O
, O
when O
the B-PER

at O
Helena B-GPE
; O
beside O
him O
on O
the O

sat O
a B-PER
stranger I-PER

The B-PER
Old I-PER
Man I-PER
pulled O
up O
at O
the B-FAC
bunk-house I-FAC
, O
the B-PER
stranger I-PER
sprang O
out O
over O
the O
wheel O
with O
the O
agility O
which O
bespoke O
youthful O
muscles O
, O
and O
the B-PER
Old I-PER
Man I-PER
introduced O
him O
with O
a O
quirk O
of O
the O
lips O
: O
“ O

” O
The B-PER
Old I-PER
Man I-PER
drove O
on O
to O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
with O
his O
own O
luggage O
, O
and O
Happy B-PER
Jack I-PER
followed O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
team O
; O
but O
the O
remainder O
of O
the B-PER
Happy I-PER
Family I-PER
unobtrusively O
took O
the O
measure O
of O
the B-PER
foreign I-PER
element I-PER
. O
From O
his O
black-and-white O
horsehair O
hatband O
, O
with O
tassels O
that O
swept O
to O
the O
very O
edge O
of O
his O
gray O
hatbrim O
, O
to O
the O
crimson O
silk O
neckerchief O
draped O
over O
the O
pale O
blue O
bosom O
of O
his O
shirt O
; O
from O
the O
beautifully O
stamped O
leather O
cuffs O
, O
down O
to O
the O
exaggerated O
height O
of O
his O
tan O
boot-heels O
, O
their O
critical O
eyes O
swept O
in O
swift O
, O
appraising O
glances O
; O
and O
unanimous O
disapproval O
was O
the O
result O
. O
The B-PER
Happy I-PER
Family I-PER
had O
themselves O
an O
eye O
to O
picturesque O
garb O
upon O
occasion O
, O
but O
this O
passed O
even O
Pink B-PER
's O
love O
of O
display O
. O
“ O
He O
's O
some O
gaudy O
to O
look O
at O
, O
” O
Irish B-PER
murmured O
under O
his O
breath O
to O
Cal B-PER
Emmett I-PER
. O
“ O
All O
he O
lacks O
is O
a O
spot-light O
and O
a O
brass O
band O
, O
” O
Cal B-PER
returned O
, O
in O
much O
the O
same O
tone O
with O
which O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
remarks O
upon O
a O
last O
season O
's O
hat O
on O
the O
head O
of O
a B-PER
rival I-PER
. O
Miguel B-PER
was O
not O
embarrassed O
by O
the O
inspection O
. O
He O
was O
tall O
, O
straight O
, O
and O
swarthily O
handsome O
, O
and O
he O
stood O
with O
the O
complacence O
of O
a B-PER
stage I-PER
favorite I-PER
waiting I-PER
for I-PER
the I-PER
applause I-PER
to I-PER
cease I-PER
so I-PER
that I-PER
he I-PER
might I-PER
speak I-PER
his I-PER
first I-PER
lines I-PER
; O
and O
, O
while O
he O
waited O
, O
he O
sifted O
tobacco O
into O
a O
cigarette O
paper O
daintily O
, O
with O
his O
little O
finger O
extended O
. O
There O
was O
a O
ring O
upon O
that O
finger O
; O
a O
ring O
with O
a O
moonstone O
setting O
as O
large O
and O
round O
as O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
startled O
cat O
, O
and O
the B-PER
Happy I-PER
Family I-PER
caught O
the O
pale O
gleam O
of O
it O
and O
drew O
a O
long O
breath O
. O
He O
lighted O
a O
match O
nonchalantly O
, O
by O
the O
artfully O
simple O
method O
of O
pinching O
the O
head O
of O
it O
with O
his O
fingernails O
, O
leaned O
negligently O
against O
the O
wall O
of O
the B-FAC
bunk-house I-FAC
, O
and O
regarded O
the B-PER
group I-PER
incuriously O
while O
he O
smoked O
. O
“ O
Any B-PER
pretty I-PER
girls I-PER
up O
this O
way O
? O
” O
he O
inquired O
languidly O
, O
after O
a O
moment O
, O
fanning O
a O
thin O
smoke-cloud O
from O
before O
his O
face O
while O
he O
spoke O
. O
The B-PER
Happy I-PER
Family I-PER
went O
prickly O
hot O
. O
The O
girls O
in O
that B-FAC
neighborhood I-FAC
were O
held O
in O
esteem O
, O
and O
there O
was O
that O
in O
his O
tone O
which O
gave O
offense O
. O
“ O
Sure O
, O
there O
's O
pretty B-PER
girls I-PER
here O
! O
” O
Big B-PER
Medicine I-PER
bellowed O
unexpectedly O
, O
close O
beside O
him O
. O
“ O
We O
're O
all O
of O
us O
engaged O
to O
` B-PER
em I-PER
, O
by O
cripes O
! O
” O
Miguel B-PER
shot O
an O
oblique O
glance O
at O
Big B-PER
Medicine I-PER
, O
examined O
the O
end O
of O
his O
cigarette O
, O
and O
gave O
a O
lift O
of O
shoulder O
, O
which O
might O
mean O
anything O
or O
nothing O
, O
and O
so O
was O
irritating O
to O
a O
degree O
. O
He O
did O
not O
pursue O
the O
subject O
further O
, O
and O
so O
several O
belated O
retorts O
were O
left O
tickling O
futilely O
the O
tongues O
of O
the B-PER
Happy I-PER
Family I-PER
-- O
which O
does O
not O
make O
for O
amiability O
. O
To O
a O
man O
they O
liked O
him O
little O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
easy O
friendliness O
with O
mankind O
in O
general O
. O
At O
supper O
they O
talked O
with O
him O
perfunctorily O
, O
and O
covertly O
sneered O
because O
he O
sprinkled O
his O
food O
liberally O
with O
cayenne O
and O
his O
speech O
with O
Spanish O
words O
pronounced O
with O
soft O
, O
slurred O
vowels O
that O
made O
them O
sound O
unfamiliar O
, O
and O
against O
which O
his O
English O
contrasted O
sharply O
with O
its O
crisp O
, O
American O
enunciation O
. O
He O
met O
their O
infrequent O
glances O
with O
the O
cool O
stare O
of O
absolute O
indifference O
to O
their O
opinion O
of O
him O
, O
and O
their O
perfunctory O
civility O
with O
introspective O
calm O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
, O
when O
there O
was O
riding O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
Miguel B-PER
appeared O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
in O
his O
working O
clothes O
, O
even O
Weary B-PER
, O
the O
sunny-hearted O
, O
had O
an O
unmistakable O
curl O
of O
his O
lip O
after O
the O
first O
glance O
. O
Miguel B-PER
wore O
the O
hatband O
, O
the O

tied O
loosely O
with O

by O

Also O
, O
the O
lower O
half O
of O
him O
was O
incased O
in O
chaps O

had O
never O

and O
with O
the O

stamped O
elaborately O
to O

the O

. O
The O
bands O
of O
his O
spurs O
were O
two O
inches O
wide O
and O
inlaid O
to O
the O
edge O
with O
beaten O
silver O
, O
and O
each O
concho O
was O
engraved O
to O
represent O
a O

with O
a O

A O
dollar O
laid O
upon O
the O

would O
have O
left O
a O

He O
bent O
over O
his O

and O
undid O
it O
, O
revealing O
a O
wonderful O
saddle O
of O
stamped O

inlaid O
on O
skirt O
and O
cantle O
with O
more O
beaten O

. O
He O
straightened O
the O
skirts O
, O
carefully O
ignoring O
the O
glances O
thrown O
in O
his O
direction O
, O
and O
swore O
softly O
to O
himself O
when O
he O
discovered O
where O
the O
leather O
had O
been O
scratched O
through O
the O
canvas O
wrappings O
and O
the O
end O
of O
the O

ripped O
up O

He O
drew O
out O
his O

and O
shook O
it O
into O

that O
they O
left O

jingling O
richly O
off O
by O

, O
while O
they O
rode O
closely O
grouped O

discussed O
him O
acrimoniously O

“ O

observed O

the O

CHAPTER O
I O
There O
was O
no O
possibility O
of O
taking O
a O
walk O
that O
day O
. O
We O
had O
been O
wandering O
, O
indeed O
, O
in O
the O
leafless O
shrubbery O
an O
hour O
in O
the O
morning O
; O
but O
since O
dinner O
( O
Mrs. B-PER
Reed O
, O
when O
there O
was O
no O
company B-PER
, O
dined O
early O
) O
the O
cold O
winter O
wind O
had O
brought O
with O
it O
clouds O
so O
sombre O
, O
and O
a O
rain O
so O
penetrating O
, O
that O
further O
out-door O
exercise O
was O
now O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O
I O
was O
glad O
of O
it O
: O
I O
never O
liked O
long O
walks O
, O
especially O
on O
chilly O
afternoons O
: O
dreadful O
to O
me O
was O
the O
coming O
home B-FAC
in O
the O
raw O
twilight O
, O
with O
nipped O
fingers O
and O
toes O
, O
and O
a O
heart O
saddened O
by O
the O
chidings O
of O
Bessie B-PER
, O
the B-PER
nurse I-PER
, O
and O
humbled O
by O
the O
consciousness O
of O
my O
physical O
inferiority O
to O
Eliza B-PER
, O
John B-PER
, O
and O
Georgiana B-PER
Reed I-PER
. O
The O
said O
Eliza B-PER
, O
John B-PER
, O
and O
Georgiana B-PER
were O
now O
clustered O
round O
their B-PER
mama I-PER
in O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
: O
she O
lay O
reclined O
on O
a O
sofa O
by O
the O
fireside O
, O
and O
with O
her B-PER
darlings I-PER
about O
her O
( O
for O
the O
time O
neither O
quarrelling O
nor O
crying O
) O
looked O
perfectly O
happy O
. O
Me O
, O
she O
had O
dispensed O
from O
joining O
the B-PER
group I-PER
; O
saying O
, O
" O
She O
regretted O
to O
be O
under O
the O
necessity O
of O
keeping O
me O
at O
a O
distance O
; O
but O
that O
until O
she O
heard O
from O
Bessie B-PER
, O
and O
could O
discover O
by O
her O
own O
observation O
, O
that O
I O
was O
endeavouring O
in O
good O
earnest O
to O
acquire O
a O
more O
sociable O
and O
childlike O
disposition O
, O
a O
more O
attractive O
and O
sprightly O
manner O
-- O
something O
lighter O
, O
franker O
, O
more O
natural O
, O
as O
it O
were O
-- O
she O
really O
must O
exclude O
me O
from O
privileges O
intended O
only O
for O
contented B-PER
, I-PER
happy I-PER
, I-PER
little I-PER
children I-PER
. O
" O
" O
What O
does O
Bessie B-PER
say O
I O
have O
done O
? O
" O
I O
asked O
. O
" O
Jane B-PER
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
cavillers B-PER
or O
questioners B-PER
; O
besides O
, O
there O
is O
something O
truly O
forbidding O
in O
a O
child O
taking O
up O
her B-PER
elders I-PER
in O
that O
manner O
. O
Be O
seated O
somewhere O
; O
and O
until O
you O
can O
speak O
pleasantly O
, O
remain O
silent O
. O
" O
A B-FAC
breakfast-room I-FAC
adjoined O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
, O
I O
slipped O
in O
there B-FAC
. O
It O
contained O
a O
bookcase O
: O
I O
soon O
possessed O
myself O
of O
a O
volume O
, O
taking O
care O
that O
it O
should O
be O
one O
stored O
with O
pictures O
. O
I O
mounted O
into O
the O
window O
- O
seat O
: O
gathering O
up O
my O
feet O
, O
I O
sat O
cross-legged O
, O
like O
a B-PER
Turk I-PER
; O
and O
, O
having O
drawn O
the O
red O
moreen O
curtain O
nearly O
close O
, O
I O
was O
shrined O
in O
double O
retirement O
. O
Folds O
of O
scarlet O
drapery O
shut O
in O
my O
view O
to O
the O
right O
hand O
; O
to O
the O
left O
were O
the O
clear O
panes O
of O
glass O
, O
protecting O
, O
but O
not O
separating O
me O
from O
the O
drear O
November O
day O
. O
At O
intervals O
, O
while O
turning O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
my O
book O
, O
I O
studied O
the O
aspect O
of O
that O
winter O
afternoon O
. O
Afar O
, O
it O
offered O
a O
pale O
blank O
of O
mist O
and O
cloud O
; O
near O
a O
scene O
of O
wet O
lawn O
and O
storm-beat O
shrub O
, O
with O
ceaseless O
rain O
sweeping O
away O
wildly O
before O
a O
long O
and O
lamentable O
blast O
. O
I O
returned O
to O
my O
book O
-- O
Bewick B-PER
's O
History O
of O
British O
Birds O
: O
the O
letterpress O
thereof O
I O
cared O
little O
for O
, O
generally O
speaking O
; O
and O
yet O
there O
were O
certain O
introductory O
pages O
that O
, O
child O
as O
I O
was O
, O
I O
could O
not O
pass O
quite O
as O
a O
blank O
. O
They O
were O
those O
which O
treat O
of O
the B-FAC
haunts I-FAC
of I-FAC
sea-fowl I-FAC
; O
of O
" O
the B-FAC
solitary I-FAC
rocks I-FAC
and I-FAC
promontories I-FAC
" O
by O
them O
only O
inhabited O
; O
of O
the O
coast O
of O
Norway B-GPE
, O
studded O
with O
isles O
from O
its O
southern B-LOC
extremity I-LOC
, O
the B-GPE
Lindeness I-GPE
, O
or O
Naze B-GPE

to O
the B-LOC
North I-LOC
Cape I-LOC
-- O
" O
Where O
the B-LOC
Northern I-LOC
Ocean I-LOC

in O

Boils O
round O

melancholy O
isles O
Of O

and O
the B-LOC
Atlantic I-LOC
surge I-LOC
Pours O
in O
among O
the B-LOC
stormy I-LOC
Hebrides I-LOC

" O
Nor O
could O
I O
pass O
unnoticed O
the O
suggestion O
of O
the O
bleak O
shores O
of O
Lapland B-LOC
, O
Siberia B-LOC
, O
Spitzbergen B-LOC
, O
Nova B-LOC

the O

and O
those B-LOC
forlorn I-LOC
regions I-LOC
of I-LOC
dreary I-LOC
space I-LOC

-- O
that B-LOC

the O
multiplied O
rigours O
of O
extreme O
cold O
. O
" O
Of O
these B-LOC
death-white I-LOC
realms I-LOC
I O
formed O
an O
idea O
of O
my O
own O
: O
shadowy O
, O
like O
all O
the O
half-comprehended O
notions O
that O
float O
dim O
through O
children B-PER
's O
brains O
, O
but O
strangely O
impressive O
. O
The O
words O
in O
these O
introductory O
pages O
connected O
themselves O
with O
the O
succeeding O
vignettes O
, O
and O
gave O
significance O
to O
the O
rock O
standing O
up O
alone O
in O
a B-LOC
sea I-LOC
of O
billow O
and O
spray O
; O
to O
the O
broken O
boat O
stranded O
on O
a B-LOC
desolate I-LOC
coast I-LOC
; O
to O
the O
cold O
and O
ghastly O
moon O
glancing O
through O
bars O
of O
cloud O
at O
a O
wreck O
just O
sinking O
. O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
what O
sentiment O
haunted O
the B-FAC
quite I-FAC
solitary I-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
, O
with O
its O
inscribed O
headstone O
; O
its O
gate O
, O
its O
two O
trees O
, O
its O
low O
horizon O
, O
girdled O
by O
a O
broken O
wall O
, O
and O
its O
newly-risen O
crescent O
, O
attesting O
the O
hour O
of O
eventide O
. O
The O
two O
ships O
becalmed O
on O
a B-LOC
torpid I-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
I O
believed O
to O
be O
marine O
phantoms O
. O
The O
fiend O
pinning O
down O
the B-PER
thief I-PER
's O
pack O
behind O
him O
, O
I O
passed O
over O
quickly O
: O
it O
was O
an O
object O
of O
terror O
. O
So O
was O
the O
black O
horned O
thing O
seated O
aloof O
on O
a O
rock O
, O
surveying O
a O
distant O
crowd O
surrounding O
a B-FAC
gallows I-FAC
. O
Each O
picture O
told O
a O
story O
; O
mysterious O
often O
to O
my O
undeveloped O
understanding O
and O
imperfect O
feelings O
, O
yet O
ever O
profoundly O
interesting O
: O
as O
interesting O
as O
the O
tales O
Bessie B-PER
sometimes O
narrated O
on O
winter O
evenings O
, O
when O
she O
chanced O
to O
be O
in O
good O
humour O
; O
and O
when O
, O
having O
brought O
her O
ironing-table O
to O
the O
nursery O
hearth O
, O
she O
allowed O
us O
to O
sit O
about O
it O
, O
and O
while O
she O
got O
up O
Mrs. B-PER
Reed O
's O
lace O
frills O
, O
and O
crimped O
her O
nightcap O
borders O
, O
fed O
our O
eager O
attention O
with O
passages O
of O
love O
and O
adventure O
taken O
from O
old O
fairy O
tales O
and O
other O
ballads O
; O
or O
( O
as O
at O
a O
later O
period O
I O
discovered O
) O
from O
the O
pages O
of O
Pamela B-PER

and O
Henry B-PER
, O
Earl B-PER
of I-PER
Moreland I-PER

With O
Bewick O
on O
my O
knee O
, O
I O
was O
then O
happy O
: O
happy O
at O
least O
in O
my O
way O
. O
I O
feared O
nothing O
but O
interruption O
, O
and O
that O
came O
too O
soon O
. O
The B-FAC
breakfast I-FAC
- I-FAC
room I-FAC
door O
opened O
. O
" O
Boh O
! O
Madam B-PER
Mope O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
voice O
of O
John B-PER
Reed I-PER
; O
then O
he O
paused O
: O
he O
found O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
apparently O
empty O
. O
" O
Where O
the O
dickens O
is O
she O
! O
" O
he O
continued O
. O
" O
Lizzy B-PER
! O
Georgy B-PER
! O
( O
calling O
to O
his B-PER
sisters I-PER
) O
Joan B-PER
is O
not O
here B-FAC
: O
tell O
mama B-PER
she O
is O
run O
out O
into O
the O
rain O
-- O
bad O
animal O
! O
" O
" O
It O
is O
well O
I O
drew O
the O
curtain O
, O
" O
thought O
I O
; O
and O
I O
wished O
fervently O
he O
might O
not O
discover O
my B-FAC
hiding-place I-FAC
: O
nor O
would O
John B-PER
Reed I-PER
have O
found O
it O
out O
himself O
; O
he O
was O
not O
quick O
either O
of O
vision O
or O
conception O
; O
but O
Eliza B-PER
just O
put O
her O
head O
in O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
said O
at O
once O
-- O
" O
She O
is O
in O
the B-FAC
window-seat I-FAC
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
Jack B-PER
. O
" O
And O
I O
came O
out O
immediately O
, O
for O
I O
trembled O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
dragged O
forth O
by O
the B-PER
said I-PER
Jack I-PER
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
want O
? O
" O
I O
asked O
, O
with O
awkward O
diffidence O
. O
" O
Say O
, O
' O
What O
do O
you O
want O
, O
Master B-PER
Reed O
? O
' O
" O
was O
the O
answer O
. O
" O
I O
want O
you O
to O
come O
here B-FAC
; O
" O
and O
seating O
himself O
in O
an B-FAC
arm-chair I-FAC
, O
he O
intimated O
by O
a O
gesture O
that O
I O
was O
to O
approach O
and O
stand O
before O
him O
. O
John B-PER
Reed I-PER
was O
a O
schoolboy O
of O
fourteen O
years O
old O
; O
four O
years O
older O
than O
I O
, O
for O
I O
was O
but O
ten O
: O
large O
and O
stout O
for O
his O
age O
, O
with O
a O
dingy O
and O
unwholesome O
skin O
; O
thick O
lineaments O
in O
a O
spacious O
visage O
, O
heavy O
limbs O
and O
large O
extremities O
. O
He O
gorged O
himself O
habitually O
at O
table O
, O
which O
made O
him O
bilious O
, O
and O
gave O
him O
a O
dim O
and O
bleared O
eye O
and O
flabby O
cheeks O
. O
He O
ought O
now O
to O
have O
been O
at O
school B-FAC
; O
but O
his B-PER
mama I-PER
had O
taken O
him O
home B-FAC
for O
a O
month O
or O
two O
, O
" O
on O
account O
of O
his O
delicate O
health O
. O
" O
Mr. B-PER
Miles O
, O
the B-PER
master I-PER
, O
affirmed O
that O
he O
would O
do O
very O
well O
if O
he O
had O
fewer O
cakes O
and O
sweetmeats O
sent O
him O
from O
home B-FAC
; O
but O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
heart O
turned O
from O
an O
opinion O
so O
harsh O
, O
and O
inclined O
rather O
to O
the O
more O
refined O
idea O
that O
John B-PER
's O
sallowness O
was O
owing O
to O
over-application O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
pining O
after O
home B-FAC
. O
John B-PER
had O
not O
much O
affection O
for O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
and O
sisters B-PER
, O
and O
an O
antipathy O
to O
me O
. O
He O
bullied O
and O
punished O
me O
; O
not O
two O
or O
three O
times O
in O
the O
week O
, O
nor O
once O
or O
twice O
in O
the O
day O
, O
but O
continually O
: O
every O
nerve O
I O
had O
feared O
him O
, O
and O
every O
morsel O
of O
flesh O
in O
my O
bones O
shrank O
when O
he O
came O
near O
. O
There O
were O
moments O
when O
I O
was O
bewildered O
by O
the O
terror O
he O
inspired O
, O
because O
I O
had O
no O
appeal O
whatever O
against O
either O
his O
menaces O

his O
inflictions O
; O
the B-PER
servants I-PER
did O
not O
like O
to O
offend O
their B-PER
young I-PER
master I-PER
by O
taking O
my O
part O
against O
him O
, O
and O
Mrs. B-PER
Reed O
was O
blind O
and O
deaf O
on O
the O
subject O
: O
she O
never O
saw O
him O
strike O
or O
heard O
him O
abuse O
me O
, O
though O
he O
did O
both O
now O
and O
then O
in O
her O
very O
presence O
, O
more O
frequently O
, O
however O
, O
behind O
her O
back O
. O
Habitually O
obedient O
to O
John B-PER
, O
I O
came O
up O
to O
his O
chair O
: O
he O
spent O
some O
three O
minutes O
in O
thrusting O
out O
his O
tongue O
at O
me O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
without O
damaging O
the O
roots O
: O
I O
knew O
he O
would O
soon O
strike O
, O
and O
while O
dreading O
the O
blow O
, O
I O
mused O
on O
the O
disgusting O
and O
ugly O
appearance O
of O
him O
who O
would O
presently O
deal O
it O
. O
I O
wonder O
if O
he O
read O
that O
notion O
in O
my O
face O
; O
for O
, O
all O
at O
once O
, O
without O
speaking O
, O
he O
struck O
suddenly O
and O
strongly O
. O
I O
tottered O
, O
and O
on O
regaining O
my O
equilibrium O
retired O
back O
a O
step O
or O
two O
from O
his O
chair O
. O
" O
That O
is O
for O
your O
impudence O
in O
answering O
mama B-PER
awhile O
since O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
and O
for O
your O
sneaking O
way O
of O
getting O
behind O
curtains O
, O
and O
for O
the O
look O
you O
had O
in O
your O
eyes O
two O
minutes O
since O
, O
you O
rat O
! O
" O
Accustomed O
to O
John B-PER
Reed I-PER
's O
abuse O
, O
I O
never O
had O
an O
idea O
of O
replying O
to O
it O
; O
my O
care O
was O
how O
to O
endure O
the O
blow O
which O
would O
certainly O
follow O
the O
insult O
. O
" O
What O
were O
you O
doing O
behind O
the O
curtain O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
I O
was O
reading O
. O
" O
" O
Show O
the O
book O
. O
" O
I O
returned O
to O
the B-FAC
window I-FAC
and O
fetched O
it O
thence O
. O
" O
You O
have O
no O
business O
to O
take O
our O
books O

you O
are O
a B-PER
dependent I-PER

mama B-PER

; O
you O
have O
no O
money O
; O
your B-PER
father I-PER
left O
you O
none O

you O
ought O
to O
beg O

not O

out O

" O
I O
did O
so O
, O
not O
at O
first O
aware O
what O
was O
his O
intention O
; O
but O
when O
I O
saw O
him O
lift O
and O
poise O
the O
book O
and O
stand O
in O
act O
to O
hurl O
it O
, O
I O
instinctively O
started O
aside O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
alarm O
: O
not O
soon O
enough O
, O
however O
; O
the O
volume O
was O
flung O
, O
it O
hit O
me O
, O
and O
I O
fell O
, O
striking O
my O
head O
against O
the O
door O
and O
cutting O
it O
. O
The O
cut O
bled O
, O
the O
pain O
was O
sharp O
: O
my O
terror O
had O
passed O
its O
climax O
; O

CHAPTER O
I. O
Down O
the B-LOC
Rabbit-Hole I-LOC
Alice B-PER
was O
beginning O
to O
get O
very O
tired O
of O
sitting O
by O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
on O
the B-LOC
bank I-LOC
, O
and O
of O
having O
nothing O
to O
do O
: O
once O
or O
twice O
she O
had O
peeped O
into O
the O
book O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
was O
reading O
, O
but O
it O
had O
no O
pictures O
or O
conversations O
in O
it O
, O
‘ O
and O
what O
is O
the O
use O
of O
a O
book O
, O
’ O
thought O
Alice B-PER
‘ O
without O
pictures O
or O
conversations O
? O
’ O
So O
she O
was O
considering O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
( O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
, O
for O
the O
hot O
day O
made O
her O
feel O
very O
sleepy O
and O
stupid O
) O
, O
whether O
the O
pleasure O
of O
making O
a O
daisy-chain O
would O
be O
worth O
the O
trouble O
of O
getting O
up O
and O
picking O
the O
daisies O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a B-PER
White I-PER
Rabbit I-PER
with I-PER
pink I-PER
eyes I-PER
ran O
close O
by O
her O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
so O
VERY O
remarkable O
in O
that O
; O
nor O
did O
Alice B-PER
think O
it O
so O
VERY O
much O
out O
of O
the O
way O
to O
hear O
the B-PER
Rabbit I-PER
say O
to O
itself O
, O
‘ O
Oh O
dear O
! O
Oh O
dear O
! O
I O
shall O
be O
late O
! O
’ O
( O
when O
she O
thought O
it O
over O
afterwards O
, O
it O
occurred O
to O
her O
that O
she O
ought O
to O
have O
wondered O
at O
this O
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
it O
all O
seemed O
quite O
natural O
) O
; O
but O
when O
the B-PER
Rabbit I-PER
actually O
TOOK O
A O
WATCH O
OUT O
OF O
ITS O
WAISTCOAT-POCKET O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
it O
, O
and O
then O
hurried O
on O
, O
Alice B-PER
started O
to O
her O
feet O
, O
for O
it O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
that O
she O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
a B-PER
rabbit I-PER
with I-PER
either I-PER
a I-PER
waistcoat-pocket I-PER
, I-PER
or I-PER
a I-PER
watch I-PER
to I-PER
take I-PER
out I-PER
of I-PER
it I-PER
, O
and O
burning O
with O
curiosity O
, O
she O
ran O
across O
the B-LOC
field I-LOC
after O
it O
, O
and O
fortunately O
was O
just O
in O
time O
to O
see O
it O
pop O
down O
a B-LOC
large I-LOC
rabbit-hole I-LOC
under I-LOC
the I-LOC
hedge I-LOC
. O
In O
another O
moment O
down O
went O
Alice B-PER
after O
it O
, O
never O
once O
considering O
how O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
she O
was O
to O
get O
out O
again O
. O
The B-LOC
rabbit-hole I-LOC
went O
straight O
on O
like O
a B-FAC
tunnel I-FAC
for O
some O
way O
, O
and O
then O
dipped O
suddenly O
down O
, O
so O
suddenly O
that O
Alice B-PER
had O
not O
a O
moment O
to O
think O
about O
stopping O
herself O
before O
she O
found O
herself O
falling O
down O
a B-FAC
very I-FAC
deep I-FAC
well I-FAC
. O
Either O
the B-FAC
well I-FAC
was O
very O
deep O
, O
or O
she O
fell O
very O
slowly O
, O
for O
she O
had O
plenty O
of O
time O
as O
she O
went O
down O
to O
look O
about O
her O
and O
to O
wonder O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
next O
. O
First O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
look O
down O
and O
make O
out O
what O
she O
was O
coming O
to O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
dark O
to O
see O
anything O
; O
then O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
sides O
of O
the B-FAC
well I-FAC
, O
and O
noticed O
that O
they O
were O
filled O
with O
cupboards O
and O
book-shelves O
; O
here O
and O
there O
she O
saw O
maps O
and O
pictures O
hung O
upon O
pegs O
. O
She O
took O
down O
a O
jar O
from O
one O
of O
the O
shelves O
as O
she O
passed O
; O
it O
was O
labelled O
‘ O
ORANGE O
MARMALADE O
’ O
, O
but O
to O
her O
great O
disappointment O
it O
was O
empty O
: O
she O
did O
not O
like O
to O
drop O
the O
jar O
for O
fear O
of O
killing O
somebody B-PER
, O
so O
managed O
to O
put O
it O
into O
one O
of O
the O
cupboards O
as O
she O
fell O
past O
it O
. O
‘ O
Well O
! O
’ O
thought O
Alice B-PER
to O
herself O
, O
‘ O
after O
such O
a O
fall O
as O
this O
, O
I O
shall O
think O
nothing O
of O
tumbling O
down O
stairs B-FAC
! O
How O
brave O
they O
’ll O
all O
think O
me O
at O
home B-FAC
! O
Why O
, O
I O
would O
n’t O
say O
anything O
about O
it O
, O
even O
if O
I O
fell O
off O
the O
top O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
! O
’ O
( O
Which O
was O
very O
likely O
true O
. O
) O
Down O
, O
down O
, O
down O
. O
Would O
the O
fall O
NEVER O
come O
to O
an O
end O
! O
‘ O
I O
wonder O
how O
many O
miles O
I O
’ve O
fallen O
by O
this O
time O
? O
’ O
she O
said O
aloud O
. O
‘ O
I O
must O
be O
getting O
somewhere O
near O
the O
centre O
of O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
. O
Let O
me O
see O
: O
that O
would O
be O
four O
thousand O
miles O
down O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
’ O
( O
for O
, O
you O
see O
, O
Alice B-PER
had O
learnt O
several O
things O
of O
this O
sort O
in O
her O
lessons O
in O
the B-FAC
schoolroom I-FAC
, O
and O
though O
this O
was O
not O
a O
VERY O
good O
opportunity O
for O
showing O
off O
her O
knowledge O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no B-PER
one I-PER
to O
listen O
to O
her O
, O
still O
it O
was O
good O
practice O
to O
say O
it O
over O
) O
‘ O
-- O
yes O
, O
that O
’s O
about O
the O
right O
distance O
-- O
but O
then O
I O
wonder O
what O
Latitude O
or O
Longitude O
I O
’ve O
got O
to O
? O
’ O
( O
Alice B-PER
had O
no O
idea O
what O
Latitude O
was O
, O
or O
Longitude O
either O
, O
but O
thought O
they O
were O
nice O
grand O
words O
to O
say O
. O
) O
Presently O
she O
began O
again O
. O
‘ O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
shall O
fall O
right O
THROUGH O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
! O
How O
funny O
it O
’ll O
seem O
to O
come O
out O
among O
the B-PER
people I-PER
that I-PER
walk I-PER
with I-PER
their I-PER
heads I-PER
downward I-PER
! O
The B-PER
Antipathies I-PER
, O
I O
think O
-- O
’ O
( O
she O
was O
rather O
glad O
there O
WAS O
no B-PER
one I-PER
listening O
, O
this O
time O
, O
as O
it O
did O
n’t O
sound O
at O
all O
the O
right O
word O
) O
‘ O
-- O
but O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
ask O
them O
what O
the O
name O
of O
the B-GPE
country I-GPE
is O
, O
you O
know O
. O
Please O
, O
Ma’am B-PER
, O
is O
this O
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
or O
Australia B-GPE
? O
’ O
( O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
curtsey O
as O
she O
spoke O
-- O
fancy O
CURTSEYING O
as O
you O
’re O
falling O
through O
the O
air O
! O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
manage O
it O
? O
) O
‘ O
And O
what O
an B-PER
ignorant I-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
she O
’ll O
think O
me O
for O
asking O
! O
No O
, O
it O
’ll O
never O
do O
to O
ask O
: O
perhaps O
I O
shall O
see O
it O
written O
up O
somewhere O
. O
’ O
Down O
, O
down O
, O
down O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
, O
so O
Alice B-PER
soon O
began O
talking O
again O
. O
‘ O
Dinah O
’ll O
miss O
me O
very O
much O
to-night O
, O
I O
should O
think O
! O
’ O
( O
Dinah O
was O
the O
cat O
. O
) O
‘ O
I O
hope O
they O
’ll O
remember O
her O
saucer O
of O
milk O
at O
tea-time O
. O
Dinah O
my O
dear O
! O
I O
wish O
you O
were O
down O
here O
with O
me O
! O
There O
are O
no O
mice O
in O
the O
air O
, O
I O
’m O
afraid O
, O
but O
you O
might O
catch O
a O
bat O
, O
and O
that O
’s O
very O
like O
a O
mouse O
, O
you O
know O
. O
But O
do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
, O
I O
wonder O
? O
’ O
And O
here O
Alice B-PER
began O
to O
get O
rather O
sleepy O
, O
and O
went O
on O
saying O
to O
herself O
, O
in O
a O
dreamy O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
‘ O
Do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
? O
Do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
? O
’ O
and O
sometimes O
, O
‘ O
Do O
bats O
eat O
cats O
? O
’ O
for O
, O
you O
see O
, O
as O
she O
could O
n’t O
answer O
either O
question O
, O
it O
did O
n’t O
much O
matter O
which O
way O
she O
put O
it O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
she O
was O
dozing O
off O
, O
and O
had O
just O
begun O
to O
dream O
that O
she O
was O
walking O
hand O
in O
hand O
with O
Dinah O
, O
and O
saying O
to O
her O
very O
earnestly O
, O
‘ O
Now O
, O
Dinah O
, O
tell O
me O
the O
truth O
: O
did O
you O
ever O
eat O
a O
bat O
? O
’ O
when O
suddenly O
, O
thump O
! O
thump O
! O
down O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
heap O
of O
sticks O
and O
dry O
leaves O
, O
and O
the O
fall O
was O
over O
. O
Alice B-PER
was O
not O
a O
bit O
hurt O
, O
and O
she O
jumped O
up O
on O
to O
her O
feet O
in O
a O
moment O
: O
she O
looked O
up O
, O
but O
it O
was O
all O
dark O
overhead O
; O
before O
her O
was O
another B-FAC
long I-FAC
passage I-FAC
, O
and O
the B-PER
White I-PER
Rabbit I-PER
was O
still O
in O
sight O
, O
hurrying O
down O
it O
. O
There O
was O
not O
a O
moment O
to O
be O
lost O
: O
away O
went O
Alice B-PER
like O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
was O
just O
in O
time O
to O
hear O
it O
say O
, O
as O
it O
turned O
a B-FAC
corner I-FAC
, O
‘ O
Oh O
my O
ears O
and O
whiskers O
, O
how O
late O
it O
’s O
getting O
! O
’ O
She O
was O
close O
behind O
it O
when O
she O
turned O
the B-FAC
corner I-FAC
, O
but O
the B-PER
Rabbit I-PER
was O
no O
longer O
to O
be O
seen O
: O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
a B-FAC
long I-FAC
, I-FAC
low I-FAC
hall I-FAC
, I-FAC
which I-FAC
was I-FAC
lit I-FAC
up I-FAC
by I-FAC
a I-FAC
row I-FAC
of I-FAC
lamps I-FAC
hanging I-FAC
from I-FAC
the I-FAC
roof I-FAC
. O
There O
were O
doors O
all O
round O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
locked O
; O
and O
when O
Alice B-PER
had O
been O
all O
the O
way O
down O
one O
side O
and O
up O
the O
other O
, O
trying O
every O
door O
, O
she O
walked O
sadly O
down O
the O
middle O
, O
wondering O
how O
she O
was O
ever O
to O
get O
out O
again O
. O
Suddenly O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
little O
three-legged O
table O
, O
all O
made O
of O
solid O
glass O
; O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
it O
except O
a O
tiny O
golden O
key O
, O
and O
Alice B-PER
’s O
first O
thought O
was O
that O
it O
might O
belong O
to O
one O
of O
the O
doors O
of O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
; O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
either O
the O
locks O
were O
too O
large O
, O
or O
the O
key O
was O
too O
small O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
it O
would O
not O
open O
any O
of O
them O
. O
However O
, O
on O
the O
second O
time O
round O
, O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
low O
curtain O
she O
had O
not O
noticed O
before O
, O
and O
behind O
it O
was O
a O
little O
door O
about O
fifteen O
inches O
high O
: O
she O
tried O
the O
little O
golden O
key O
in O
the O
lock O
, O
and O
to O
her O
great O
delight O
it O
fitted O
! O
Alice B-PER
opened O
the O
door O
and O
found O
that O
it O
led O
into O
a O
small O
passage O
, O
not O
much O
larger O
than O
a B-LOC
rat-hole I-LOC
: O
she O
knelt O
down O
and O
looked O
along O
the B-FAC
passage I-FAC
into O
the B-FAC
loveliest I-FAC
garden I-FAC
you I-FAC
ever I-FAC
saw I-FAC
. O
How O
she O
longed O
to O
get O
out O
of O
that B-FAC
dark I-FAC
hall I-FAC
, O
and O
wander O
about O
among O
those B-LOC
beds I-LOC
of I-LOC
bright I-LOC
flowers I-LOC
and O
those O
cool O
fountains O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
even O
get O
her O
head O
through O
the O
doorway O
; O
‘ O
and O
even O
if O
my O
head O
would O
go O
through O
, O
’ O
thought O
poor O
Alice B-PER
, O
‘ O
it O
would O
be O
of O
very O
little O
use O
without O
my O
shoulders O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
shut O
up O
like O
a O
telescope O
! O
I O
think O
I O
could O
, O
if O
I O
only O
knew O
how O
to O
begin O
. O
’ O
For O
, O
you O
see O
, O
so O
many O
out-of-the-way O
things O
had O
happened O
lately O
, O
that O
Alice B-PER
had O
begun O
to O
think O
that O
very O
few O
things O
indeed O
were O
really O
impossible O
. O
There O
seemed O
to O
be O
no O
use O
in O
waiting O
by O
the O
little O
door O
, O
so O
she O
went O
back O
to O
the O
table O
, O
half O
hoping O
she O
might O
find O
another O
key O
on O
it O
, O
or O
at O
any O
rate O
a O
book O
of O
rules O
for O
shutting O
people B-PER
up O
like O
telescopes O
: O
this O
time O
she O
found O
a O
little O
bottle O
on O
it O
, O
[ O
‘ O
which O
certainly O
was O
not O
here O
before O
, O
’ O
said O
Alice B-PER
, O
) O
and O
round O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
bottle O
was O
a O
paper O
label O
, O
with O
the O
words O
‘ O
DRINK O
ME O
’ O
beautifully O
printed O
on O
it O
in O
large O
letters O
. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
well O
to O
say O
‘ O
Drink O
me O
, O
’ O
but O
the B-PER
wise I-PER
little I-PER
Alice I-PER
was O
not O
going O
to O
do O
THAT O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
‘ O
No O
, O
I O
’ll O
look O
first O
, O
’ O
she O
said O
, O
‘ O
and O
see O
whether O
it O
’s O
marked O
“ O
poison O
” O
or O
not O
’ O
; O
for O
she O
had O
read O
several O
nice O
little O
histories O
about O
children B-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
got I-PER
burnt I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
eaten I-PER
up I-PER
by I-PER
wild I-PER
beasts I-PER
and I-PER
other I-PER
unpleasant I-PER
things I-PER
, O
all O
because O
they O
WOULD O
not O
remember O
the O
simple O
rules O
their B-PER
friends I-PER
had O
taught O
them O
: O
such O
as O
, O
that O
a O
red-hot O
poker O
will O
burn O
you O
if O
you O
hold O
it O
too O
long O
; O
and O
that O
if O
you O
cut O
your O
finger O
VERY O
deeply O
with O
a O
knife O
, O
it O
usually O
bleeds O
; O
and O
she O
had O
never O
forgotten O
that O
, O
if O
you O
drink O
much O
from O
a O
bottle O
marked O
‘ O
poison O
, O
’ O
it O
is O
almost O
certain O
to O
disagree O
with O
you O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
. O
However O
, O
this O
bottle O
was O
NOT O
marked O
‘ O
poison O
, O
’ O
so O
Alice B-PER
ventured O
to O
taste O
it O
, O
and O
finding O
it O
very O
nice O
, O
( O
it O
had O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
mixed O
flavour O
of O
cherry-tart O
, O
custard O
, O
pine-apple O
, O
roast O
turkey O
, O
toffee O
, O
and O
hot O
buttered O
toast O
, O
) O
she O
very O
soon O
finished O
it O
off O
. O

‘ O
What O
a O
curious O
feeling O
! O
’ O
said O
Alice B-PER
; O
‘ O
I O
must O
be O
shutting O
up O
like O
a O
telescope O
. O
’ O
And O
so O
it O
was O
indeed O
: O
she O
was O
now O
only O
ten O
inches O
high O
, O
and O
her O
face O
brightened O
up O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
she O
was O
now O
the O
right O
size O
for O
going O
through O
the O
little O
door O
into O
that B-FAC
lovely I-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
First O
, O
however O
, O
she O
waited O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
see O
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
shrink O
any O
further O
: O
she O
felt O
a O
little O
nervous O
about O
this O
; O
‘ O
for O
it O
might O
end O
, O
you O
know O
, O
’ O
said O
Alice B-PER
to O
herself O
, O
‘ O
in O
my O
going O
out O
altogether O
, O
like O
a O
candle O
. O
I O
wonder O
what O
I O
should O
be O
like O
then O
? O
’ O
And O
she O
tried O
to O
fancy O
what O
the O
flame O
of O
a O
candle O
is O
like O
after O
the O
candle O
is O
blown O
out O
, O
for O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
ever O
having O
seen O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

, O
the O
chateau O
of O
Monsieur B-PER
St. O

From O
its O
windows O
were O
seen O
the O
pastoral O
landscapes O
of O
Guienne B-PER
and O
Gascony B-PER
stretching O
along O
the O
river B-LOC
, O
gay O
with O
luxuriant B-LOC
woods I-LOC
and I-LOC
vine I-LOC
, O
and O
plantations B-LOC
of I-LOC
olives I-LOC
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
the O
view O
was O
bounded O
by O
the B-LOC
majestic I-LOC
Pyrenees I-LOC
, O
whose O
summits O
, O
veiled O
in O
clouds O
, O
or O
exhibiting O
awful O
forms O
, O
seen O
, O
and O
lost O
again O
, O
as O
the O
partial O
vapours O
rolled O
along O
, O
were O
sometimes O
barren O
, O
and O
gleamed O
through O
the O
blue O
tinge O
of O
air O
, O
and O
sometimes O
frowned O
with O
forests O
of O
gloomy O
pine O
, O
that O
swept O
downward O
to O
their O
base O
. O
These B-LOC
tremendous I-LOC
precipices I-LOC
were O
contrasted O
by O
the O
soft O
green O
of O
the B-LOC
pastures I-LOC
and I-LOC
woods I-LOC
that I-LOC
hung I-LOC
upon I-LOC
their I-LOC
skirts I-LOC

among O

simple B-FAC
cottages I-FAC
, O
the O
eye O
, O
after O
having O
scaled O
the B-LOC
cliffs I-LOC

, O
delighted O
to O
repose O

To O
the O
north O
, O
and O
to O
the O
east O
, O
the O
plains O
of O
Guienne B-PER

were O
lost O
in O
the O
mist O

distance O
; O
on O
the O
west O
, O
Gascony B-GPE
was O
bounded O
by O
the O
waters O

M. B-PER
St. I-PER
Aubert I-PER
loved O
to O
wander O
, O
with O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
daughter B-PER
, O
on O
the B-LOC
margin I-LOC
of I-LOC
the I-LOC
Garonne I-LOC
, O
and O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
music O
that O
floated O
on O
its O
waves O
. O
He O
had O
known O
life O
in O
other O
forms O
than O
those O
of O
pastoral O
simplicity O
, O
having O
mingled O
in O
the O
gay O
and O
in O
the O
busy O
scenes O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
; O
but O
the O
flattering O
portrait O
of O
mankind B-PER
, O
which O
his B-PER
heart I-PER
had O
delineated O
in O
early O
youth O
, O
his O
experience O
had O
too O
sorrowfully O
corrected O
. O
Yet O
, O
amidst O
the O
changing O
visions O
of O
life O
, O
his O
principles O
remained O
unshaken O
, O
his O
benevolence O
unchilled O
; O
and O
he O
retired O
from O
the O
multitude O
' O
more O
in O
PITY O
than O
in O
anger O
, O
' O
to O
scenes O
of O
simple O
nature O
, O
to O
the O
pure O
delights O
of O
literature O
, O
and O
to O
the O
exercise O
of O
domestic O
virtues O
. O
He O
was O
a O
descendant O
from O
the O
younger O
branch O
of O
an B-PER
illustrious I-PER
family I-PER
, O
and O
it O
was O
designed O
, O
that O
the O
deficiency O
of O
his O
patrimonial O
wealth O
should O
be O
supplied O
either O
by O
a O
splendid O
alliance O
in O
marriage O
, O
or O
by O
success O
in O
the O
intrigues O
of O
public O
affairs O
. O
But O
St. B-PER
Aubert O
had O
too O
nice O
a O
sense O
of O
honour O
to O
fulfil O
the O
latter O
hope O
, O
and O
too O
small O
a O
portion O
of O
ambition O
to O
sacrifice O
what O
he O
called O
happiness O
, O
to O
the O
attainment O
of O
wealth O
. O
After O
the O
death O
of O
his B-PER
father I-PER
he O
married O
a B-PER
very I-PER
amiable I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
his O
equal O
in O
birth O
, O
and O
not O
his O
superior O
in O
fortune O
. O
The B-PER
late I-PER
Monsieur B-PER
St. O
Aubert O
's O
liberality O
, O
or O
extravagance O
, O
had O
so O
much O
involved O
his O
affairs O
, O
that O
his B-PER
son I-PER
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
dispose O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
family O
domain O
, O
and O
, O
some O
years O
after O
his O
marriage O
, O
he O
sold O
it O
to O
Monsieur B-PER
Quesnel O
, O
the O
brother O
of O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
and O
retired O
to O
a O
small O
estate O
in O
Gascony B-GPE
, O
where O
conjugal O
felicity O
, O
and O
parental O
duties O
, O
divided O
his O
attention O
with O
the O
treasures O
of O
knowledge O
and O
the O
illuminations O
of O
genius O
. O
To O
this B-FAC
spot I-FAC
he O
had O
been O
attached O
from O
his O
infancy O
. O
He O
had O
often O
made O
excursions O
to O
it O
when O
a O
boy O
, O
and O
the O
impressions O
of O
delight O
given O
to O
his O
mind O
by O
the O
homely O
kindness O
of O
the B-PER
grey-headed I-PER
peasant I-PER
, O
to O
whom O
it O
was O
intrusted O
, O
and O
whose O
fruit O
and O
cream O
never O
failed O
, O
had O
not O
been O
obliterated O
by O
succeeding O
circumstances O
. O
The B-LOC
green I-LOC
pastures I-LOC
along O
which O
he O
had O
so O
often O
bounded O
in O
the O
exultation O
of O
health O
, O
and O
youthful O
freedom O
-- O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
, O
under O
whose O
refreshing O
shade O
he O
had O
first O
indulged O
that O
pensive O
melancholy O
, O
which O
afterwards O
made O
a O
strong O
feature O
of O
his O
character O
-- O
the O
wild O
walks O
of O
the B-LOC
mountains I-LOC
, O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
on O
whose O
waves O
he O
had O
floated O
, O
and O
the B-LOC
distant I-LOC
plains I-LOC
, O
which O
seemed O
boundless O
as O
his O
early O
hopes O
-- O
were O
never O
after O
remembered O
by O
St. B-PER
Aubert O
but O
with O
enthusiasm O
and O
regret O
. O
At O
length O
he O
disengaged O
himself O
from O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
and O
retired O
hither O
, O
to O
realize O
the O
wishes O
of O
many O
years O
. O
The B-FAC
building I-FAC
, O
as O
it O
then O
stood O
, O
was O
merely O
a B-FAC
summer I-FAC
cottage I-FAC
, O
rendered O
interesting O
to O
a B-PER
stranger I-PER
by O
its O
neat O
simplicity O
, O
or O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
surrounding O
scene O
; O
and O
considerable O
additions O
were O
necessary O
to O
make O
it O
a B-FAC
comfortable I-FAC
family I-FAC
residence I-FAC
. O
St. B-PER
Aubert O
felt O
a O
kind O
of O
affection O
for O
every O
part O
of O
the O
fabric O
, O
which O
he O
remembered O
in O
his O
youth O
, O
and O
would O
not O
suffer O
a O
stone O
of O
it O
to O
be O
removed O
, O
so O
that O
the B-FAC
new I-FAC
building I-FAC
, O
adapted O
to O
the O
style O
of O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
one I-FAC
, O
formed O
with O
it O
only O
a B-FAC
simple I-FAC
and I-FAC
elegant I-FAC
residence I-FAC
. O
The O
taste O
of O
Madame B-PER
St. O
Aubert O
was O
conspicuous O
in O
its O
internal O
finishing O
, O
where O
the O
same O
chaste O
simplicity O
was O
observable O
in O
the O
furniture O
, O
and O
in O
the O
few O
ornaments O
of O
the O
apartments B-FAC
, O
that O
characterized O
the O
manners O
of O
its B-PER
inhabitants I-PER
. O
The B-FAC
library I-FAC
occupied O
the B-FAC
west I-FAC
side I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
chateau I-FAC
, O
and O
was O
enriched O
by O
a O
collection O
of O
the O
best O
books O
in O
the O
ancient O
and O
modern O
languages O
. O
This B-FAC
room I-FAC
opened O
upon O
a B-LOC
grove I-LOC
, O
which O
stood O
on O
the B-LOC
brow I-LOC
of I-LOC
a I-LOC
gentle I-LOC
declivity I-LOC
, O
that O
fell O
towards O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
tall O
trees O
gave O
it O
a O
melancholy O
and O
pleasing O
shade O
; O
while O
from O
the O
windows O
the O
eye O
caught O
, O
beneath O
the O
spreading O
branches O
, O
the B-LOC
gay I-LOC
and I-LOC
luxuriant I-LOC
landscape I-LOC
stretching I-LOC
to I-LOC
the I-LOC
west I-LOC
, O
and O
overlooked O
on O
the O
left O
by O
the B-LOC
bold I-LOC
precipices I-LOC
of I-LOC
the I-LOC
Pyrenees I-LOC
. O
Adjoining O
the B-FAC
library I-FAC
was O
a B-FAC
green-house I-FAC
, O
stored O
with O
scarce O
and O
beautiful O
plants O
; O
for O
one O
of O
the O
amusements O
of O
St. B-PER
Aubert O
was O
the O
study O
of O
botany O
, O
and O
among O
the B-LOC
neighbouring I-LOC
mountains I-LOC
, O
which O
afforded O
a O
luxurious O
feast O
to O
the O
mind O
of O
the B-PER
naturalist I-PER
, O
he O
often O
passed O
the O
day O
in O
the O
pursuit O
of O
his O
favourite O
science O
. O
He O
was O
sometimes O
accompanied O
in O
these O
little O
excursions O
by O
Madame B-PER
St. O
Aubert O
, O
and O
frequently O
by O
his B-PER
daughter I-PER
; O
when O
, O
with O
a O
small O
osier O
basket O
to O
receive O
plants O
, O
and O
another O
filled O
with O
cold O
refreshments O
, O
such O
as O
the O
cabin O
of O
the B-PER
shepherd I-PER
did O
not O
afford O
, O
they O
wandered O
away O
among O
the O
most O
romantic O
and O
magnificent O
scenes O
, O
nor O
suffered O
the O
charms O
of O
Nature O
's O
lowly O
children O
to O
abstract O
them O
from O
the O
observance O
of O
her O
stupendous O
works O
. O
When O
weary O
of O
sauntering O
among O
cliffs O
that O
seemed O
scarcely O
accessible O
but O
to O
the O
steps O
of O
the B-PER
enthusiast I-PER
, O
and O
where O
no O
track O
appeared O
on O
the O
vegetation O
, O
but O
what O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
izard O
had O
left O
; O
they O
would O
seek O
one B-LOC
of I-LOC
those I-LOC
green I-LOC
recesses I-LOC
, O
which O
so O
beautifully O
adorn O
the B-LOC
bosom I-LOC
of I-LOC
these I-LOC
mountains I-LOC
, O
where O
, O
under O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
lofty O
larch O
, O
or O
cedar O
, O
they O
enjoyed O
their O
simple O
repast O
, O
made O
sweeter O
by O
the O
waters O
of O
the B-LOC
cool I-LOC
stream I-LOC
, I-LOC
that I-LOC
crept I-LOC
along I-LOC
the I-LOC
turf I-LOC

by O
the O
breath O
of O
wild O

Adjoining O
the B-FAC
eastern I-FAC
side I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
green-house I-FAC
, O
looking O
towards O
the O
plains O
of O
Languedoc B-PER
, O
was O
a B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
which O
Emily B-PER
called O
hers O

and O
which O
contained O
her O
books O

her O

, O
her O
musical O
instruments O
, O
with O
some O
favourite O
birds O
and O
plants O
. O
Here B-FAC
she O
usually O
exercised O
herself O
in O
elegant O
arts O
, O
cultivated O
only O
because O
they O
were O
congenial O
to O
her O
taste O
, O
and O
in O
which O
native O
genius O
, O
assisted O
by O
the O
instructions O
of O
Monsieur B-PER
and O
Madame B-PER
St. O
Aubert O
, O
made O
her O
an O
early O
proficient O
. O
The O
windows O
of O
this B-FAC
room I-FAC
were O
particularly O
pleasant O
; O
they O
descended O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
, O
opening O
upon O
the B-FAC
little I-FAC
lawn I-FAC
that I-FAC
surrounded I-FAC
the I-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
the O
eye O
was O
led O
between O
groves O
of O
almond O
, O
palm-trees O
, O
flowering-ash O
, O
and O
myrtle O
, O
to O
the O
distant O
landscape O
, O
where O
the B-LOC
Garonne I-LOC
wandered O
. O
The B-PER
peasants I-PER
of I-PER
this I-PER
gay I-PER
climate I-PER
were O
often O
seen O
on O
an O
evening O
, O
when O
the O
day O
's O
labour O
was O
done O
, O
dancing O
in O
groups O
on O
the B-LOC
margin I-LOC
of I-LOC
the I-LOC
river I-LOC
. O
Their O
sprightly O
melodies O
, O
debonnaire O
steps O
, O
the O
fanciful O
figure O
of O
their O
dances O
, O
with O
the O
tasteful O
and O
capricious O
manner O
in O
which O
the B-PER
girls I-PER
adjusted O
their O
simple O
dress O
, O
gave O
a O
character O
to O
the O
scene O
entirely O
French O
. O
The B-FAC
front I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
chateau I-FAC
, O
which O
, O
having O
a O
southern O
aspect O
, O
opened O
upon O
the O
grandeur O
of O
the B-LOC
mountains I-LOC
, O
was O
occupied O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
by O
a B-FAC
rustic I-FAC
hall I-FAC
, O
and O
two B-FAC
excellent I-FAC
sitting I-FAC
rooms I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
first I-FAC
floor I-FAC
, O
for O
the B-FAC
cottage I-FAC
had O
no O
second B-FAC
story I-FAC
, O
was O
laid O
out O
in O
bed-chambers B-FAC
, O
except O
one B-FAC
apartment I-FAC
that I-FAC
opened I-FAC
to I-FAC
a I-FAC
balcony I-FAC
, O
and O
which O
was O
generally O
used O
for O
a B-FAC
breakfast-room I-FAC
. O
In O
the B-FAC
surrounding I-FAC
ground I-FAC
, O
St. B-PER
Aubert O
had O
made O
very O
tasteful O
improvements O
; O
yet O
, O
such O
was O
his O
attachment O
to O
objects O
he O
had O
remembered O
from O
his O
boyish O
days O
, O
that O
he O
had O
in O
some O
instances O
sacrificed O
taste O
to O
sentiment O
. O
There O
were O
two O
old O
larches O
that O
shaded O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
, O
and O
interrupted O
the O
prospect O
; O
St. B-PER
Aubert O
had O
sometimes O
declared O
that O
he O
believed O
he O
should O
have O
been O
weak O
enough O
to O
have O
wept O
at O
their O
fall O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
these O
larches O
he O
planted O
a O
little O
grove O
of O
beech O
, O
pine O
, O
and O
mountain-ash O
. O
On O
a B-FAC
lofty I-FAC
terrace I-FAC
, O
formed O
by O
the B-LOC
swelling I-LOC
bank I-LOC
of I-LOC
the I-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
rose O
a B-FAC
plantation I-FAC
of I-FAC
orange I-FAC
, I-FAC
lemon I-FAC
, I-FAC
and I-FAC
palm-trees I-FAC
, I-FAC
whose I-FAC
fruit I-FAC
, I-FAC
in I-FAC
the I-FAC
coolness I-FAC
of I-FAC
evening I-FAC
, I-FAC
breathed I-FAC
delicious I-FAC
fragrance I-FAC
. O
With O
these O
were O
mingled O
a O
few O
trees O
of O
other O
species O
. O
Here B-FAC
, O
under O
the O
ample O
shade O
of O
a O
plane-tree O
, O
that O
spread O
its O
majestic O
canopy O
towards O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
St. B-PER
Aubert O
loved O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
fine O
evenings O
of O
summer O
, O
with O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
children B-PER
, O
watching O
, O
beneath O
its O
foliage O
, O
the O
setting O
sun O
, O
the O
mild O
splendour O
of O
its O
light O
fading O
from O
the O
distant O
landscape O
, O
till O
the O
shadows O
of O
twilight O
melted O
its O
various O
features O
into O
one O
tint O
of O
sober O
grey O
. O
Here B-FAC
, O
too O
, O
he O
loved O
to O
read O
, O
and O
to O
converse O
with O
Madame B-PER
St. O
Aubert O
; O
or O
to O
play O
with O
his B-PER
children I-PER
, O
resigning O
himself O
to O
the O
influence O
of O
those O
sweet O
affections O
, O
which O
are O
ever O
attendant O
on O
simplicity O
and O
nature O
. O
He O
has O
often O
said O
, O
while O
tears O
of O
pleasure O
trembled O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
that O
these O
were O
moments O
infinitely O
more O
delightful O
than O
any O
passed O
amid O
the O
brilliant O
and O
tumultuous O
scenes O
that O
are O
courted O
by O
the B-PER
world I-PER
. O
His B-PER
heart I-PER
was O
occupied O
; O
it O
had O
, O
what O
can O
be O
so O
rarely O
said O
, O
no O
wish O
for O
a O
happiness O
beyond O
what O
it O
experienced O
. O
The O
consciousness O
of O
acting O
right O
diffused O
a O
serenity O
over O
his O
manners O
, O
which O
nothing O
else O
could O
impart O
to O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
moral I-PER
perceptions I-PER
like I-PER
his I-PER
, O
and O
which O
refined O
his O
sense O
of O
every O
surrounding O
blessing O
. O
The O
deepest O
shade O
of O
twilight O
did O
not O
send O
him O
from O
his O
favourite O
plane-tree O
. O
He O
loved O
the O
soothing O
hour O
, O
when O
the O
last O
tints O
of O
light O
die O
away O
; O
when O
the O
stars O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
tremble O
through O
aether O
, O
and O
are O
reflected O
on O
the O
dark O
mirror O
of O
the O
waters O
; O
that O
hour O
, O
which O
, O
of O
all O
others O
, O
inspires O
the O
mind O
with O
pensive O
tenderness O
, O
and O
often O
elevates O
it O
to O
sublime O
contemplation O
. O
When O
the O
moon O
shed O
her O
soft O
rays O
among O
the O
foliage O
, O
he O
still O
lingered O
, O
and O
his O
pastoral O
supper O
of O
cream O
and O
fruits O
was O
often O
spread O
beneath O
it O
. O
Then O
, O
on O
the O
stillness O
of O
night O
, O
came O
the O
song O
of O
the O
nightingale O
, O
breathing O
sweetness O
, O
and O
awakening O
melancholy O
. O
May O
7th O
. O
-- O
I O
love O
my B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
I O
am O
writing O
in O
it O
now O
in O
the O
late O
afternoon O
loveliness O
, O
much O
interrupted O
by O
the O
mosquitoes O
and O
the O
temptation O
to O
look O
at O
all O
the O
glories O
of O
the O
new O
green O
leaves O
washed O
half O
an O
hour O
ago O
in O
a O
cold O
shower O
. O
Two O
owls O
are O
perched O
near O
me O
, O
and O
are O
carrying O
on O
a O
long O
conversation O
that O
I O
enjoy O
as O
much O
as O
any O
warbling O
of O
nightingales O
. O
The O
gentleman O
owl O
says O
[ O
[ O
musical O
notes O
occur O
here O
in O
the O
printed O
text O
] O
] O
, O
and O
she O
answers O
from O
her O
tree O
a O
little O
way O
off O
, O
[ O
[ O
musical O
notes O
] O
] O
, O
beautifully O
assenting O
to O
and O
completing O
her O
lord O
’s O
remark O
, O
as O
becomes O
a O
properly O
constructed O
German O
she-owl O
. O
They O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
over O
and O
over O
again O
so O
emphatically O
that O
I O
think O
it O
must O
be O
something O
nasty O
about O
me O
; O
but O
I O
shall O
not O
let O
myself O
be O
frightened O
away O
by O
the O
sarcasm O
of O
owls O
. O
This O
is O
less O
a B-FAC
garden I-FAC
than O
a B-LOC
wilderness I-LOC
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
has O
lived O
in O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
much O
less O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
for O
twenty-five O
years O
, O
and O
it O
is O
such O
a B-FAC
pretty I-FAC
old I-FAC
place I-FAC
that O
the O
people O
who O
might O
have O
lived O
here B-FAC
and O
did O
not O
, O
deliberately O
preferring O
the O
horrors O
of O
a O
flat O
in O
a B-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
must O
have O
belonged O
to O
that O
vast O
number O
of O
eyeless O
and O
earless O
persons O
of O
whom O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
seems O
chiefly O
composed O
. O
Noseless O
too O
, O
though O
it O
does O
not O
sound O
pretty O
; O
but O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
my O
spring O
happiness O
is O
due O
to O
the O
scent O
of O
the O
wet O
earth O
and O
young O
leaves O
. O
I O
am O
always O
happy O
( O
out O
of O
doors O
be O
it O
understood O
, O
for O
indoors O
there O
are O
servants B-PER
and O
furniture O
) O
but O
in O
quite O
different O
ways O
, O
and O
my O
spring O
happiness O
bears O
no O
resemblance O
to O
my O
summer O
or O
autumn O
happiness O
, O
though O
it O
is O
not O
more O
intense O
, O
and O
there O
were O
days O
last O
winter O
when O
I O
danced O
for O
sheer O
joy O
out O
in O
my B-FAC
frost-bound I-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
in O
spite O
of O
my O
years O
and O
children B-PER
. O
But O
I O
did O
it O
behind O
a O
bush O
, O
having O
a O
due O
regard O
for O
the O
decencies O
. O
There O
are O
so O
many O
bird-cherries O
round O
me O
, O
great O
trees O
with O
branches O
sweeping O
the O
grass O
, O
and O
they O
are O
so O
wreathed O
just O
now O
with O
white O
blossoms O
and O
tenderest O
green O
that O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
looks O
like O
a O
wedding O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
such O
masses O
of O
them O
; O
they O
seemed O
to O
fill O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
. O
Even O
across O
a O
little O
stream O
that O
bounds O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
on O
the O
east O
, O
and O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the B-FAC
cornfield I-FAC
beyond I-FAC
, O
there O
is O
an O
immense O
one O
, O
a O
picture O
of O
grace O
and O
glory O
against O
the O
cold O
blue O
of O
the O
spring O
sky O
. O
My B-FAC
garden I-FAC
is O
surrounded O
by O
cornfields B-FAC
and O
meadows B-LOC
, O
and O
beyond O
are O
great O
stretches O
of O
sandy B-LOC
heath I-LOC
and O
pine B-LOC
forests I-LOC
, O
and O
where O
the B-LOC
forests I-LOC
leave O
off O
the B-LOC
bare I-LOC
heath I-LOC
begins O
again O
; O
but O
the B-LOC
forests I-LOC
are O
beautiful O
in O
their O
lofty O
, O
pink-stemmed O
vastness O
, O
far O
overhead O
the O
crowns O
of O
softest O
gray-green O
, O
and O
underfoot O
a O
bright O
green O
wortleberry O
carpet O
, O
and O
everywhere O
the O
breathless O
silence O
; O
and O
the B-LOC
bare I-LOC
heaths I-LOC
are O
beautiful O
too O
, O
for O
one O
can O
see O
across O
them O
into O
eternity O
almost O
, O
and O
to O
go O
out O
on O
to O
them O
with O
one O
’s O
face O
towards O
the O
setting O
sun O
is O
like O
going O
into O
the O
very O
presence O
of O
God B-PER
. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
this B-LOC
plain I-LOC
is O
the B-FAC
oasis I-FAC
of I-FAC
birdcherries I-FAC
and I-FAC
greenery I-FAC
where I-FAC
I I-FAC
spend I-FAC
my I-FAC
happy I-FAC
days I-FAC
, O
and O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the B-FAC
oasis I-FAC
is O
the B-FAC
gray I-FAC
stone I-FAC
house I-FAC
with I-FAC
many I-FAC
gables I-FAC
where I-FAC
I I-FAC
pass I-FAC
my I-FAC
reluctant I-FAC
nights I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
house I-FAC
is O
very O
old O
, O
and O
has O
been O
added O
to O
at O
various O
times O
. O
It O
was O
a B-FAC
convent I-FAC
before O
the O
Thirty O
Years O
’ O
War O
, O
and O
the B-FAC
vaulted I-FAC
chapel I-FAC
, O
with O
its O
brick O
floor O
worn O
by O
pious O
peasant B-PER
knees O
, O
is O
now O
used O
as O
a B-FAC
hall I-FAC

Gustavus B-PER
Adolphus I-PER

his B-PER
Swedes I-PER
passed O
through O
more O
than O
once O

as O
is O
duly O
recorded O
in O

for O
we O

on O
what O
was O
then O
the O
high-road O
between O
Sweden B-GPE

Brandenburg B-GPE
the I-GPE
unfortunate I-GPE
. O
The O
Lion O
of O
the B-LOC
North I-LOC
was O
no O
doubt O
an B-PER
estimable I-PER
person I-PER
and O
acted O
wholly O
up O
to O
his O
convictions O
, O
but O
he O
must O
have O
sadly O
upset O
the B-PER
peaceful I-PER
nuns I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
not I-PER
without I-PER
convictions I-PER
of I-PER
their I-PER
own I-PER
, O
sending O
them O
out O
on O
to O
the B-LOC
wide I-LOC
, I-LOC
empty I-LOC
plain I-LOC
to O
piteously O
seek O
some O
life O
to O
replace O
the O
life O
of O
silence O
here B-FAC
. O
From O
nearly O
all O
the O
windows O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
I O
can O
look O
out O
across O
the B-LOC
plain I-LOC

with O
no O

in O
the O
shape O
of O
a B-LOC
hill I-LOC

right O
away O
to O
a O

of O
distant B-LOC
forest I-LOC

and O
on O
the O
west O

uninterruptedly O
to O
the O

nothing O

a B-LOC
green I-LOC

rolling I-LOC
plain I-LOC

with O
a O
sharp O
edge O
against O
the O
sunset O

I O
love O
those O
west O
windows O
better O
than O
any O
others O
, O
and O
have O
chosen O
my B-FAC
bedroom I-FAC
on O
that O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
so O
that O
even O
times O
of O
hair-brushing O
may O
not O
be O
entirely O
lost O
, O
and O
the B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
who I-PER
attends I-PER
to I-PER
such I-PER
matters I-PER
has O
been O
taught O
to O
fulfil O
her O

about O
a B-PER
mistress I-PER
recumbent I-PER
in I-PER
an I-PER
easychair I-PER
before I-PER
an I-PER
open I-PER
window I-PER
, O
and O
not O
to O
profane O
with O
chatter O
that O
sweet O
and O
solemn O
time O
. O
This B-PER
girl I-PER
is O
grieved O
at O
my O
habit O
of O
living O
almost O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
and O
all O
her O
ideas O
as O
to O
the O
sort O
of O
life O
a B-PER
respectable I-PER
German I-PER
lady I-PER
should O
lead O
have O
got O
into O
a O
sad O
muddle O
since O
she O
came O
to O
me O
. O
The B-PER
people I-PER
round I-PER
about I-PER
are O
persuaded O
that O
I O
am O
, O
to O
put O
it O
as O
kindly O
as O
possible O
, O
exceedingly O
eccentric O
, O
for O
the O
news O
has O
travelled O
that O
I O
spend O
the O
day O
out O
of O
doors O
with O
a O
book O

and O
that O
no O
mortal O
eye O
has O
ever O
yet O
seen O
me O
sew O

But O
why O
cook O
when O
you O
can O
get O
some O
one O
to O
cook O
for O
you O
? O
And O
as O
for O
sewing O
, O
the B-PER
maids I-PER
will O
hem O
the O
sheets O
better O
and O
quicker O
than O
I O
could O
, O
and O
all O
forms O
of O
needlework O
of O
the O
fancy O
order O
are O
inventions O
of O
the B-PER
evil I-PER
one I-PER
for O
keeping O
the B-PER
foolish I-PER
from O
applying O
their O
heart O
to O
wisdom O
. O
We O
had O
been O
married O
five O
years O
before O
it O
struck O
us O
that O
we O
might O
as O
well O
make O
use O
of O
this B-FAC
place I-FAC
by O
coming O
down O

living O
in O
it O

Those O
five O

were O
spent O
in O
a O

a B-GPE

during O
their O
whole O
interminable O
length O
I O
was O
perfectly O
miserable O
and O
perfectly O
healthy O
, O
which O
disposes O
of O
the O
ugly O
notion O
that O
has O
at O
times O
disturbed O
me O
that O
my O
happiness O
here B-FAC
is O
less O
due O
to O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
than O
to O
a O
good O
digestion O
. O
And O
while O
we O
were O
wasting O
our O
lives O
there B-FAC

here B-FAC
was O
this B-FAC
dear I-FAC
place I-FAC
with O
dandelions O
up O
to O
the O
very O
door O
, O
all O
the O
paths O
grass-grown O
and O
completely O
effaced O

in O
winter O
so O
lonely O
, O
with O
nobody B-PER

the I-PER
north I-PER
wind I-PER
taking O
the O
least O
notice O
of O
it O

in O
May O

in O
all O
those O
five O
lovely O
Mays O

no B-PER
one I-PER
to O
look O
at O
the O
wonderful O
bird-cherries O

still O
more O
wonderful O
masses O
of O
lilacs O

everything O
glowing O
and O
blowing O
, O
the O
virginia O
creeper O
madder O
every O
year O
, O
until O
at O
last O
, O
in O
October O
, O
the O
very O
roof O
was O
wreathed O
with O
blood-red O
tresses O
, O
the O
owls O
and O
the O
squirrels O
and O
all O
the O
blessed O
little O
birds O
reigning O
supreme O
, O
and O
not O
a O
living O
creature O
ever O
entering O
the B-FAC
empty I-FAC
house I-FAC
except O
the O
snakes O
, O
which O
got O
into O
the O
habit O
during O
those O
silent O
years O
of O
wriggling O
up O
the O
south O
wall O
into O
the B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
on I-FAC
that I-FAC
side I-FAC
whenever O
the B-PER
old I-PER
housekeeper I-PER
opened O
the O
windows O

All O
that O
was O
here B-FAC
, O
-- O
peace O
, O
and O
happiness O
, O
and O
a O
reasonable O
life O
, O
-- O
and O
yet O
it O
never O
struck O
me O
to O
come O
and O
live O
in O
it O
. O
Looking O
back O
I O
am O
astonished O
, O
and O
can O
in O
no O
way O
account O
for O
the O
tardiness O
of O
my O
discovery O
that O
here B-FAC
, O
in O
this O
far-away O
corner O
, O
was O
my B-FAC
kingdom I-FAC
of I-FAC
heaven I-FAC
. O
Indeed O
, O
so O
little O
did O
it O
enter O
my O
head O
to O
even O
use O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
in O
summer O
, O
that O
I O
submitted O
to O
weeks O
of O
seaside O
life O
with O
all O
its O
horrors O
every O
year O
; O
until O
at O
last O
, O
in O
the O
early O
spring O
of O
last O
year O
, O
having O
come O
down O
for O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
village B-GPE
school O
, O
and O
wandering O
out O
afterwards O
into O
the B-FAC
bare I-FAC
and I-FAC
desolate I-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
smell O
of O
wet O
earth O
or O
rotting O
leaves O
brought O
back O
my O
childhood O
with O
a O
rush O
and O
all O
the O
happy O
days O
I O
had O
spent O
in O
a B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
Shall O
I O
ever O
forget O
that O
day O
? O
It O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
my O
real O
life O
, O
my O
coming O
of O
age O
as O
it O
were O
, O
and O
entering O
into O
my O
kingdom O

Early O
March O

gray O

brown B-LOC

quiet I-LOC

leafless O
and O
sad O
and O
lonely O
enough O
out O
there O
in O
the O
damp O
and O
silence O
, O
yet O
there O
I O
stood O
feeling O
the O
same O
rapture O
of O
pure O
delight O
in O
the O
first O
breath O
of O
spring O
that O
I O
used O
to O
as O
a B-PER
child I-PER
, O
and O
the O
five O
wasted O
years O
fell O
from O
me O
like O
a O
cloak O
, O
and O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
was O
full O
of O
hope O
, O
and O
I O
vowed O
myself O
then O
and O
there O
to O
nature O
, O
and O
have O
been O
happy O
ever O
since O
. O
My O
other O
half O
being O
indulgent O
, O
and O
with O
some O
faint O
thought O
perhaps O
that O
it O
might O
be O
as O
well O
to O
look O
after O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
, O
consented O
to O
live O
in O
it O
at O
any O
rate O
for O
a O
time O
; O
whereupon O
followed O
six O
specially O
blissful O
weeks O
from O
the O
end O
of O
April O
into O
June O
, O
during O
which O
I O
was O
here B-FAC
alone O
, O
supposed O
to O
be O
superintending O
the O
painting O
and O
papering O
, O
but O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
only O
going O
into O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
when O
the B-PER
workmen I-PER
had O
gone O
out O
of O
it O
. O
How O
happy O
I O
was O
! O
I O
do O
n’t O
remember O
any O
time O
quite O
so O
perfect O
since O
the O
days O
when O
I O
was O
too O
little O
to O
do O
lessons O
and O
was O
turned O
out O
with O
sugar O
on O
my O
eleven O
o’clock O
bread O
and O
butter O
on O
to O
a B-FAC
lawn I-FAC
closely I-FAC
strewn I-FAC
with I-FAC
dandelions I-FAC
and I-FAC
daisies I-FAC
. O
The O
sugar O
on O
the O
bread O
and O
butter O
has O
lost O
its O
charm O
, O
but O
I O
love O
the O
dandelions O
and O
daisies O
even O
more O
passionately O
now O
than O
then O
, O
and O
never O
would O
endure O
to O
see O
them O
all O
mown O
away O
if O
I O
were O
not O
certain O
that O
in O
a O
day O
or O
two O
they O
would O
be O
pushing O
up O
their O
little O
faces O
again O
as O
jauntily O
as O
ever O
. O
During O
those O
six O
weeks O
I O
lived O
in O
a O
world O
of O
dandelions O
and O
delights O
. O
The O
dandelions O
carpeted O
the O
three O
lawns O
, O
-- O
they O
used O
to O
be O
lawns O
, O
but O
have O
long O
since O
blossomed O
out O
into O
meadows O
filled O
with O
every O
sort O
of O
pretty O
weed O
, O
-- O
and O
under O
and O
among O
the O
groups O
of O
leafless O
oaks O
and O
beeches O
were O
blue O
hepaticas O
, O
white O
anemones O
, O
violets O
, O
and O
celandines O
in O
sheets O
. O
The O
celandines O
in O
particular O
delighted O
me O
with O
their O
clean O
, O
happy O
brightness O
, O
so O
beautifully O
trim O
and O
newly O
varnished O
, O
as O
though O
they O
too O
had O
had O
the B-PER
painters I-PER
at O
work O
on O
them O
. O
Then O
, O
when O
the O
anemones O
went O
, O
came O
a O
few O
stray O
periwinkles O
and O
Solomon O
’s O
Seal O
, O
and O
all O
the O
birdcherries O
blossomed O
in O
a O
burst O
. O
And O
then O
, O
before O
I O
had O
a O
little O
got O
used O
to O
the O
joy O
of O
their O
flowers O
against O
the O
sky O
, O
came O
the O
lilacs O
-- O
masses O
and O
masses O
of O
them O
, O
in O
clumps O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
with O
other O
shrubs O
and O
trees O
by O
the O
side O
of O
walks O
, O
and O
one O
great O
continuous O
bank O
of O
them O
half O
a O
mile O
long O
right O
past O
the O
west O
front O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
away O
down O
as O
far O
as O
one O
could O
see O
, O
shining O
glorious O
against O
a O
background O
of O
firs O
. O
When O
that O
time O
came O
, O
and O
when O
, O
before O
it O
was O
over O
, O
the O
acacias O
all O
blossomed O
too O
, O
and O
four O
great O
clumps O
of O
pale O
, O
silvery-pink O
peonies O
flowered O
under O
the O
south O
windows O
, O
I O
felt O
so O
absolutely O
happy O
, O
and O
blest O
, O
and O
thankful O
, O
and O
grateful O
, O
that O
I O
really O
can O
not O
describe O
it O
. O
My O
days O
seemed O
to O
melt O
away O
in O
a O
dream O
of O
pink O
and O
purple O
peace O

any O
unwelcome O

arising O
from O

naturally O

he O

the O
almost O
endless O

( O
having O
met O
with O
one O
or O
two O
private O
disappointments O

very O

applications O

, O
prided O
himself O

his B-PER
dear I-PER
daughters I-PER

For O
one B-PER
daughter I-PER
, O
his B-PER
eldest I-PER
, O
he O
would O
really O
have O
given O
up O
any O
thing O
, O
which O
he O
had O
not O
been O
very O
much O
tempted O
to O
do O

Elizabeth B-PER
had O
succeeded O
, O
at O
sixteen O
, O
to O
all O
that O
was O
possible O
, O
of O
her B-PER
mother I-PER

rights O

consequence O
; O
and O
being O
very O
handsome O
, O
and O
very O
like O
himself O
, O
her O
influence O
had O
always O
been O
great O
, O
and O
they O
had O
gone O
on O
together O
most O
happily O
. O
His B-PER
two I-PER
other I-PER
children I-PER
were O
of O
very O
inferior O
value O
. O
Mary B-PER
had O
acquired O
a O
little O
artificial O
importance O
, O
by O
becoming O
Mrs B-PER
Charles O
Musgrove O
; O
but O
Anne B-PER
, O
with O
an O
elegance O
of O
mind O
and O
sweetness O
of O
character O
, O
which O
must O
have O
placed O
her O
high O
with O
any B-PER
people I-PER
of I-PER
real I-PER
understanding I-PER
, O
was O
nobody B-PER
with O
either O
father B-PER
or O
sister B-PER
; O
her O
word O
had O
no O
weight O
, O
her O
convenience O
was O
always O
to O
give O
way O
-- O
she O
was O
only O
Anne B-PER

To O
Lady B-PER
Russell O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
was O
a B-PER
most I-PER
dear I-PER
and I-PER
highly I-PER
valued I-PER
god-daughter I-PER
, I-PER
favourite I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
friend I-PER
. O
Lady B-PER
Russell O
loved O
them O
all O
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
in O
Anne B-PER
that O
she O
could O
fancy O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
to O
revive O
again O
. O
A O
few O
years O
before O
, O
Anne B-PER
Elliot I-PER
had O
been O
a B-PER
very I-PER
pretty I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
but O
her O
bloom O
had O
vanished O
early O
; O
and O
as O
even O
in O
its O
height O
, O
her B-PER
father I-PER
had O
found O
little O
to O
admire O
in O
her O
, O
( O
so O
totally O
different O
were O
her O
delicate O
features O
and O
mild O
dark O
eyes O
from O
his O
own O
) O
, O
there O
could O
be O
nothing O
in O
them O
, O
now O
that O
she O
was O
faded O
and O
thin O
, O
to O
excite O
his O
esteem O
. O
He O
had O
never O
indulged O
much O
hope O
, O
he O
had O
now O
none O
, O
of O
ever O
reading O
her O
name O
in O
any O
other O
page O
of O
his O
favourite O
work O
. O
All O
equality O
of O
alliance O
must O
rest O
with O
Elizabeth B-PER
, O
for O
Mary B-PER
had O
merely O
connected O
herself O
with O
an B-PER
old I-PER
country I-PER
family I-PER
of I-PER
respectability I-PER
and I-PER
large I-PER
fortune I-PER
, O
and O
had O
therefore O
given O
all O
the O
honour O
and O
received O
none O
: O
Elizabeth B-PER
would O
, O
one O
day O
or O
other O
, O
marry O
suitably O
. O
It O
sometimes O
happens O
that O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
is O
handsomer O
at O
twenty-nine O
than O
she O
was O
ten O
years O
before O
; O
and O
, O
generally O
speaking O
, O
if O
there O
has O
been O
neither O
ill O
health O
nor O
anxiety O
, O
it O
is O
a O
time O
of O
life O
at O
which O
scarcely O
any O
charm O
is O
lost O
. O
It O
was O
so O
with O
Elizabeth B-PER
, O
still O
the B-PER
same I-PER
handsome I-PER
Miss I-PER
Elliot I-PER
that O
she O
had O
begun O
to O
be O
thirteen O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
Sir B-PER
Walter O
might O
be O
excused O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
forgetting O
her O
age O
, O
or O
, O
at O
least O
, O
be O
deemed O
only B-PER
half I-PER
a I-PER
fool I-PER
, O
for O
thinking O
himself O
and O
Elizabeth B-PER
as O
blooming O
as O
ever O
, O
amidst O
the O
wreck O
of O
the O
good O
looks O
of O
everybody B-PER
else I-PER
; O
for O
he O
could O
plainly O
see O
how O
old O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
his B-PER
family I-PER
and O
acquaintance B-PER
were O
growing O
. O
Anne B-PER
haggard O

Mary B-PER
coarse O

and O
the O
rapid O
increase O
of O
the O
crow O
's O
foot O
about O
Lady B-PER
Russell O
's O
temples O
had O
long O
been O
a O
distress O
to O
him O
. O
Elizabeth B-PER
did O
not O
quite O
equal O
her B-PER
father I-PER
in O
personal O
contentment O
. O
Thirteen O
years O
had O
seen O
her O
mistress O
of O
Kellynch B-FAC
Hall I-FAC
, O
presiding O
and O
directing O
with O
a O
self-possession O
and O
decision O
which O
could O
never O
have O
given O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
being O
younger O
than O
she O
was O
. O
For O
thirteen O
years O
had O
she O
been O
doing O
the O
honours O
, O
and O
laying O
down O
the O
domestic O
law O
at O
home B-FAC
, O
and O
leading O
the O
way O
to O
the B-VEH
chaise I-VEH

four I-VEH
, O
and O
walking O
immediately O
after O
Lady B-PER
Russell O
out O
of O
all O
the O
drawing-rooms O
and O
dining-rooms O
in O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
. O
Thirteen O
winters O
' O
revolving O
frosts O
had O
seen O
her O
opening O
every O
ball O
of O
credit O
which O
a B-FAC
scanty I-FAC
neighbourhood I-FAC
afforded O
, O
and O
thirteen O
springs O
shewn O
their O
blossoms O
, O
as O
she O
travelled O
up O
to O
London B-GPE
with O
her B-PER
father I-PER
, O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
' O
annual O
enjoyment O
of O
the B-LOC
great I-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
She O
had O
the O
remembrance O
of O
all O
this O
, O
she O
had O
the O
consciousness O
of O
being O
nine-and-twenty O
to O
give O
her O
some O
regrets O
and O
some O
apprehensions O
; O
she O
was O
fully O
satisfied O
of O
being O
still O
quite O
as O
handsome O
as O
ever O
, O
but O
she O
felt O
her O
approach O
to O
the O
years O
of O
danger O
, O
and O
would O
have O
rejoiced O
to O
be O
certain O
of O
being O
properly O
solicited O
by O
baronet-blood B-PER
within O
the O
next O
twelvemonth O
or O
two O

Then O
might O
she O
again O
take O
up O
the O
book O
of O
books O
with O
as O
much O
enjoyment O
as O
in O
her O
early O
youth O
, O
but O
now O
she O
liked O
it O
not O
. O
Always O
to O
be O
presented O
with O
the O
date O
of O
her O
own O
birth O
and O
see O
no O
marriage O
follow O
but O
that O
of O
a B-PER
youngest I-PER
sister I-PER
, O
made O
the O
book O
an O
evil O
; O
and O
more O
than O
once O
, O
when O
her B-PER
father I-PER
had O
left O
it O
open O
on O
the O
table O
near O
her O

she O
closed O
it O

with O
averted O
eyes O

pushed O
it O
away O

She O
had O
had O
a O
disappointment O

moreover O
, O
which O
that O
book O
, O
and O
especially O
the O
history O
of O
her B-PER
own I-PER
family I-PER
, O
must O
ever O
present O
the O
remembrance O
of O

The B-PER
heir I-PER

the B-PER
very I-PER
William I-PER
Walter I-PER

Esq. I-PER
, O
whose O
rights O

She O

while O

very I-PER
young I-PER
girl I-PER

soon O
after O
Lady B-PER
Elliot O

Sir B-PER

sought O
the O
acquaintance O

though O
his O
overtures O
had O
not O
been O
met O
with O
any O
warmth O
, O
he O
had O
persevered O
in O
seeking O
it O
, O
making O
allowance O
for O
the O
modest O
drawing-back O
of O
youth O
; O
and O
, O
in O
one O
of O
their O
spring O
excursions O
to O
London B-GPE
, O
when O
Elizabeth B-PER
was O
in O
her O
first O
bloom O
, O
Mr B-PER
Elliot O
had O
been O
forced O
into O
the O
introduction O
. O
He O
was O
at O
that O
time O
a B-PER
very I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, O
just O
engaged O
in O
the O
study O
of O
the O
law O
; O
and O
Elizabeth B-PER
found O
him O
extremely O
agreeable O
, O
and O
every O
plan O
in O
his O
favour O
was O
confirmed O
. O
He O
was O
invited O
to O
Kellynch B-FAC
Hall I-FAC
; O
he O
was O
talked O

expected O
all O
the O
rest O

he O
never O
came O

The O
following O
spring O
he O

again O
in O

found O
equally O
agreeable O

again O
encouraged O

invited O

expected O
, O

again O
he O
did O
not O
come O

and O
the O
next O
tidings O
were O
that O
he O
was O
married O

Instead O
of O
pushing O
his O
fortune O
in O
the O
line O
marked O
out O
for O
the O
heir O

-- O
TO O
Mrs. B-PER
Saville O
, O
England B-GPE
You O
will O
rejoice O
to O
hear O
that O
no O
disaster O
has O
accompanied O
the O
commencement O
of O
an O
enterprise O
which O
you O
have O
regarded O
with O
such O
evil O
forebodings O
. O
I O
arrived O
here B-GPE
yesterday O
, O
and O
my O
first O
task O
is O
to O
assure O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
sister I-PER
of O
my O
welfare O
and O
increasing O
confidence O
in O
the O
success O
of O
my O
undertaking O
. O
I O
am O
already O
far O
north O
of O
London B-GPE
, O
and O
as O
I O
walk O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Petersburgh B-GPE
, O
I O
feel O
a O
cold O
northern O
breeze O
play O
upon O
my O
cheeks O
, O
which O
braces O
my O
nerves O
and O
fills O
me O
with O
delight O
. O
Do O
you O
understand O
this O
feeling O
? O
This O
breeze O
, O
which O
has O
travelled O
from O
the B-LOC
regions I-LOC
towards I-LOC
which I-LOC
I I-LOC
am I-LOC
advancing I-LOC
, O
gives O
me O
a O
foretaste O
of O
those B-LOC
icy I-LOC
climes I-LOC
. O
Inspirited O
by O
this O
wind O
of O
promise O
, O
my O
daydreams O
become O
more O
fervent O
and O
vivid O
. O
I O
try O
in O
vain O
to O
be O
persuaded O
that O
the B-LOC
pole I-LOC
is O
the B-LOC
seat I-LOC
of I-LOC
frost I-LOC
and I-LOC
desolation I-LOC
; O
it O
ever O
presents O
itself O
to O
my O
imagination O
as O
the B-LOC
region I-LOC
of I-LOC
beauty I-LOC
and I-LOC
delight I-LOC
. O
There B-LOC
, O
Margaret B-PER
, O
the O
sun O
is O
forever O
visible O
, O
its O
broad O
disk O
just O
skirting O
the O
horizon O
and O
diffusing O
a O
perpetual O
splendour O
. O
There B-LOC
-- O
for O
with O
your O
leave O
, O
my B-PER
sister I-PER
, O
I O
will O
put O
some O
trust O
in O
preceding B-PER
navigators I-PER
-- O
there B-LOC
snow O
and O
frost O
are O
banished O
; O
and O
, O
sailing O
over O
a B-LOC
calm I-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
we O
may O
be O
wafted O
to O
a O
land O
surpassing O
in O
wonders O
and O
in O
beauty O
every O
region O
hitherto O
discovered O
on O
the B-LOC
habitable I-LOC
globe I-LOC
. O
Its O
productions O
and O
features O
may O
be O
without O
example O
, O
as O
the O
phenomena O
of O
the O
heavenly O
bodies O
undoubtedly O
are O
in O
those B-LOC
undiscovered I-LOC
solitudes I-LOC
. O
What O
may O
not O
be O
expected O
in O
a B-LOC
country I-LOC
of I-LOC
eternal I-LOC
light I-LOC
? O
I O
may O
there B-LOC
discover O
the O
wondrous O
power O
which O
attracts O
the O
needle O
and O
may O
regulate O
a O
thousand O
celestial O
observations O
that O
require O
only O
this O
voyage O
to O
render O
their O
seeming O
eccentricities O
consistent O
forever O
. O
I O
shall O
satiate O
my O
ardent O
curiosity O
with O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
never O
before O
visited O
, O
and O
may O
tread O
a O
land O
never O
before O
imprinted O
by O
the O
foot O
of O
man B-PER
. O
These O
are O
my O
enticements O
, O
and O
they O
are O
sufficient O
to O
conquer O
all O
fear O
of O
danger O
or O
death O
and O
to O
induce O
me O
to O
commence O
this O
laborious O
voyage O
with O
the O
joy O
a B-PER
child I-PER
feels O
when O
he O
embarks O
in O
a B-VEH
little I-VEH
boat I-VEH
, O
with O
his B-PER
holiday I-PER
mates I-PER
, O
on O
an O
expedition O
of O
discovery O
up O
his B-LOC
native I-LOC
river I-LOC
. O
But O
supposing O
all O
these O
conjectures O
to O
be O
false O
, O
you O
can O
not O
contest O
the O
inestimable O
benefit O
which O
I O
shall O
confer O
on O
all O
mankind B-PER
, O
to O
the B-PER
last I-PER
generation I-PER
, O
by O
discovering O
a O
passage O
near O
the B-LOC
pole I-LOC
to O
those B-GPE
countries I-GPE
, O
to O
reach O
which O
at O
present O
so O
many O
months O
are O
requisite O
; O
or O
by O
ascertaining O
the O
secret O
of O
the O
magnet O
, O
which O
, O
if O
at O
all O
possible O
, O
can O
only O
be O
effected O
by O
an O
undertaking O
such O
as O
mine O
. O
These O
reflections O
have O
dispelled O
the O
agitation O
with O
which O
I O
began O
my O
letter O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
my O
heart O
glow O
with O
an O
enthusiasm O
which O
elevates O
me O
to O
heaven O
, O
for O
nothing O
contributes O
so O
much O
to O
tranquillize O
the O
mind O
as O
a O
steady O
purpose O
-- O
a O
point O
on O
which O
the O
soul O
may O
fix O
its O
intellectual O
eye O
. O
This O
expedition O
has O
been O
the O
favourite O
dream O
of O
my O
early O
years O
. O
I O
have O
read O
with O
ardour O
the O
accounts O
of O
the O
various O
voyages O
which O
have O
been O
made O
in O
the O
prospect O
of O
arriving O
at O
the B-LOC
North I-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
through O
the O
seas O
which O
surround O
the B-LOC
pole I-LOC
. O
You O
may O
remember O
that O
a O
history O
of O
all O
the O
voyages O
made O
for O
purposes O
of O
discovery O
composed O
the O
whole O
of O
our B-PER
good I-PER
Uncle I-PER
Thomas I-PER
' O
library O
. O
My O
education O
was O
neglected O
, O
yet O
I O
was O
passionately O
fond O
of O
reading O
. O
These O
volumes O
were O
my O
study O
day O
and O
night O
, O
and O
my O
familiarity O
with O
them O
increased O
that O
regret O
which O
I O
had O
felt O
, O
as O
a B-PER
child I-PER
, O
on O
learning O
that O
my B-PER
father I-PER
's O
dying O
injunction O
had O
forbidden O
my B-PER
uncle I-PER
to O
allow O
me O
to O
embark O
in O
a O
seafaring O
life O
. O
These O
visions O
faded O
when O
I O
perused O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
those O
poets O
whose O
effusions O
entranced O
my B-PER
soul I-PER
and O
lifted O
it O
to O
heaven O
. O
I O
also O
became O
a B-PER
poet I-PER
and O
for O
one O
year O
lived O
in O
a O
paradise O
of O
my O
own O
creation O
; O
I O
imagined O
that O
I O
also O
might O
obtain O
a O
niche O
in O
the O
temple O
where O
the O
names O
of O
Homer B-PER
and O
Shakespeare B-PER
are O
consecrated O
. O
You O
are O
well O
acquainted O
with O
my O
failure O
and O
how O
heavily O
I O
bore O
the O
disappointment O
. O
But O
just O
at O
that O
time O
I O
inherited O
the O
fortune O
of O
my B-PER
cousin I-PER
, O
and O
my O
thoughts O
were O
turned O
into O
the O
channel O
of O
their O
earlier O
bent O
. O
Six O
years O
have O
passed O
since O
I O
resolved O
on O
my O
present O
undertaking O
. O
I O
can O
, O
even O
now O
, O
remember O
the O
hour O
from O
which O
I O
dedicated O
myself O
to O
this O
great O
enterprise O
. O
I O
commenced O
by O
inuring O
my B-PER
body I-PER
to O
hardship O
. O
I O
accompanied O
the B-PER
whale-fishers I-PER
on O
several O
expeditions O
to O
the B-LOC
North I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
; O
I O
voluntarily O
endured O
cold O
, O
famine O
, O
thirst O
, O
and O
want O
of O
sleep O
; O
I O
often O
worked O
harder O
than O
the B-PER
common I-PER
sailors I-PER
during O
the O
day O
and O
devoted O
my O
nights O
to O
the O
study O
of O
mathematics O
, O
the O
theory O
of O
medicine O
, O
and O
those O
branches O
of O
physical O
science O
from O
which O
a B-PER
naval I-PER
adventurer I-PER
might O
derive O
the O
greatest O
practical O
advantage O
. O
Twice O
I O
actually O
hired O
myself O
as O
an O
under-mate O
in O
a B-VEH
Greenland I-VEH
whaler I-VEH
, O
and O
acquitted O
myself O
to O
admiration O
. O
I O
must O
own O
I O
felt O
a O
little O
proud O
when O
my B-PER
captain I-PER
offered O
me O
the O
second O
dignity O
in O
the B-VEH
vessel I-VEH
and O
entreated O
me O
to O
remain O
with O
the O
greatest O
earnestness O
, O
so O
valuable O
did O
he O
consider O
my O
services O
. O
And O
now O
, O
dear O
Margaret B-PER
, O
do O
I O
not O
deserve O
to O
accomplish O
some O
great O
purpose O
? O
My O
life O
might O
have O
been O
passed O
in O
ease O
and O
luxury O
, O
but O
I O
preferred O
glory O
to O
every O
enticement O
that O
wealth O
placed O
in O
my O
path O
. O
Oh O
, O
that O
some O
encouraging O
voice O
would O
answer O
in O
the O
affirmative O
! O
My O
courage O
and O
my O
resolution O
is O
firm O
; O
but O
my O
hopes O
fluctuate O
, O
and O
my O
spirits O
are O
often O
depressed O
. O
I O
am O
about O
to O
proceed O
on O
a O
long O
and O
difficult O
voyage O
, O
the O
emergencies O
of O
which O
will O
demand O
all O
my O
fortitude O
: O
I O
am O
required O
not O
only O
to O
raise O
the O
spirits O
of O
others O
, O
but O
sometimes O
to O
sustain O
my O
own O
, O
when O
theirs O
are O
failing O
. O
This O
is O
the O
most O
favourable O
period O
for O
travelling O
in O
Russia B-GPE
. O
They O
fly O
quickly O
over O
the O
snow O
in O
their O
sledges O
; O
the O
motion O
is O
pleasant O
, O
and O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
far O
more O
agreeable O
than O
that O
of O
an B-VEH
English I-VEH
stagecoach I-VEH
. O
The O
cold O
is O
not O
excessive O
, O
if O
you O
are O
wrapped O
in O
furs O
-- O
a O
dress O
which O
I O
have O
already O
adopted O
, O
for O
there O
is O
a O
great O
difference O
between O
walking O
the O
deck O
and O
remaining O
seated O
motionless O
for O
hours O
, O
when O
no O
exercise O
prevents O
the O
blood O
from O
actually O
freezing O
in O
your O
veins O
. O
I O
have O
no O
ambition O
to O
lose O
my O
life O
on O
the O
post-road O
between O
St. B-GPE
Petersburgh I-GPE
and O
Archangel B-GPE
. O
I O
shall O
depart O
for O
the B-GPE
latter I-GPE
town I-GPE
in O
a O
fortnight O
or O
three O
weeks O
; O
and O
my O
intention O
is O
to O
hire O
a B-VEH
ship I-VEH
there B-GPE
, O
which O
can O
easily O
be O
done O
by O
paying O
the O
insurance O
for O
the B-PER
owner I-PER
, O
and O
to O
engage O
as O
many O
sailors B-PER
as O
I O
think O
necessary O
among O
those B-PER
who I-PER
are I-PER
accustomed I-PER
to I-PER
the I-PER
whale-fishing I-PER
. O
I O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
sail O
until O
the O
month O
of O
June O
; O
and O
when O
shall O
I O
return O
? O
Ah O
, O
dear O
sister B-PER
, O
how O
can O
I O
answer O
this O
question O
? O
If O
I O
succeed O
, O
many O
, O
many O
months O
, O
perhaps O
years O
, O
will O
pass O
before O
you O
and O
I O
may O
meet O
. O
If O
I O
fail O
, O
you O
will O
see O
me O
again O
soon O
, O
or O
never O
. O
Farewell O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER

excellent B-PER
Margaret I-PER

Heaven O
shower O
down O
blessings O
on O
you O

that O
I O
may O
again O

again O
testify O

all O
your O

To O
Mrs. B-PER
Saville O
, O
England B-GPE
How O
slowly O
the O
time O
passes O
here B-GPE
, O
encompassed O
as O
I O
am O
by O
frost O
and O
snow O
! O
Yet O
a O
second O
step O
is O
taken O
towards O
my O
enterprise O
. O
I O
have O
hired O
a B-VEH
vessel I-VEH
and O
am O
occupied O
in O
collecting O
my B-PER
sailors I-PER
; O
those O
whom O
I O
have O
already O
engaged O
appear O
to O
be O
men B-PER
on I-PER
whom I-PER
I I-PER
can I-PER
depend I-PER
and O
are O
certainly O
possessed O
of O
dauntless O
courage O
. O
But O
I O
have O
one O
want O
which O
I O
have O
never O
yet O
been O
able O
to O
satisfy O
, O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
object O
of O
which O
I O
now O
feel O
as O
a O
most O
severe O
evil O
, O
I O
have O
no O
friend B-PER
, O
Margaret B-PER
: O
when O
I O
am O
glowing O
with O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
success O
, O
there O
will O
be O
none O
to O
participate O
my O
joy O
; O
if O
I O
am O
assailed O
by O
disappointment O
, O
no B-PER
one I-PER
will O
endeavour O
to O
sustain O
me O
in O
dejection O
. O
I O
shall O
commit O
my O
thoughts O
to O
paper O
, O
it O
is O
true O
; O
but O
that O
is O
a O
poor O
medium O
for O
the O
communication O
of O
feeling O
. O
I O
desire O
the O
company O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
could I-PER
sympathize I-PER
with I-PER
me I-PER
, O
whose O
eyes O
would O
reply O
to O
mine O
. O
You O
may O
deem O
me O
romantic O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
sister I-PER
, O
but O
I O
bitterly O
feel O
the O
want O
of O
a B-PER
friend I-PER
. O
I O
have O
no B-PER
one I-PER
near O
me O
, O
gentle O
yet O
courageous O
, O
possessed O
of O
a O
cultivated O
as O
well O
as O
of O
a O
capacious O
mind O
, O
whose O
tastes O
are O
like O
my O
own O
, O
to O
approve O
or O
amend O
my O
plans O
. O
How O
would O
such O
a B-PER
friend I-PER
repair O
the O
faults O
of O
your B-PER
poor I-PER
brother I-PER
! O
I O
am O
too O
ardent O
in O
execution O
and O
too O
impatient O
of O
difficulties O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
still O
greater O
evil O
to O
me O
that O
I O
am O
self-educated O
: O
for O
the O
first O
fourteen O
years O
of O
my O
life O
I O
ran O
wild O
on O
a O
common O
and O
read O
nothing O
but O
our B-PER
Uncle I-PER
Thomas B-PER
' O
books O
of O
voyages O
. O
At O
that O
age O
I O
became O
acquainted O
with O
the O
celebrated O
poets O
of O
our B-GPE
own I-GPE
country I-GPE
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
when O
it O
had O
ceased O
to O
be O
in O
my O
power O
to O
derive O
its O
most O
important O
benefits O
from O
such O
a O
conviction O
that O
I O
perceived O
the O
necessity O
of O
becoming O
acquainted O
with O
more O
languages O
than O
that O
of O
my B-GPE
native I-GPE
country I-GPE
. O
Now O
I O
am O
twenty-eight O
and O
am O
in O
reality O
more O
illiterate O
than O
many B-PER
schoolboys I-PER
of I-PER
fifteen I-PER
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
I O
have O
thought O
more O
and O
that O
my O
daydreams O
are O
more O
extended O
and O
magnificent O
, O
but O
they O
want O
( O
as O
the B-PER
painters I-PER
call O
it O
) O
KEEPING O
; O
and O
I O
greatly O
need O
a B-PER
friend I-PER
who I-PER
would I-PER
have I-PER
sense I-PER
enough I-PER
not I-PER
to I-PER
despise I-PER
me I-PER
as I-PER
romantic I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
affection I-PER
enough I-PER
for I-PER
me I-PER
to I-PER
endeavour I-PER
to I-PER
regulate I-PER
my I-PER
mind I-PER
. O
Well O
, O
these O
are O
useless O
complaints O
; O
I O
shall O
certainly O
find O
no B-PER
friend I-PER
on O
the B-LOC
wide I-LOC
ocean I-LOC
, O
nor O
even O
here B-GPE
in O
Archangel B-GPE
, O
among O
merchants B-PER
and O
seamen B-PER
. O
Yet O
some O
feelings O
, O
unallied O
to O
the O
dross O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
beat O
even O
in O
these B-LOC
rugged I-LOC
bosoms I-LOC
. O
My B-PER
lieutenant I-PER
, O
for O
instance O
, O
is O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
wonderful I-PER
courage I-PER
and I-PER
enterprise I-PER
; O
he O
is O
madly O
desirous O
of O
glory O
, O
or O
rather O
, O
to O
word O
my O
phrase O
more O
characteristically O
, O
of O
advancement O
in O
his O
profession O
. O
He O
is O
an B-PER
Englishman I-PER
, O
and O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
national O
and O
professional O
prejudices O
, O
unsoftened O
by O
cultivation O
, O
retains O
some O
of O
the O
noblest O
endowments O
of O
humanity O
. O
I O
first O
became O
acquainted O
with O
him O
on O
board O
a B-VEH
whale I-VEH
vessel I-VEH
; O
finding O
that O
he O
was O
unemployed O
in O
this B-GPE
city I-GPE
, O
I O
easily O
engaged O
him O
to O
assist O
in O
my O
enterprise O
. O
The B-PER
master I-PER
is O
a B-PER
person I-PER
of I-PER
an I-PER
excellent I-PER
disposition I-PER
and O
is O
remarkable O
in O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
for O
his O
gentleness O
and O
the O
mildness O
of O
his O
discipline O
. O
This O
circumstance O
, O
added O
to O
his O
well-known O
integrity O
and O
dauntless O
courage O
, O
made O
me O
very O
desirous O
to O
engage O
him O
. O
A O
youth O
passed O
in O
solitude O
, O
my O
best O
years O
spent O
under O
your O
gentle O
and O
feminine O
fosterage O
, O
has O
so O
refined O
the O
groundwork O
of O
my O
character O
that O
I O
can O
not O
overcome O
an O
intense O
distaste O
to O
the O
usual O
brutality O
exercised O
on O
board O
ship B-VEH
: O
I O
have O
never O
believed O
it O
to O
be O
necessary O
, O
and O
when O
I O
heard O
of O
a B-PER
mariner I-PER
equally O
noted O
for O
his O
kindliness O
of O
heart O
and O
the O
respect O
and O
obedience O
paid O
to O
him O
by O
his B-PER
crew I-PER
, O
I O
felt O
myself O
peculiarly O
fortunate O
in O
being O
able O
to O
secure O
his O
services O
. O
I O
heard O
of O
him O
first O
in O
rather O
a O
romantic O
manner O
, O
from O
a B-PER
lady I-PER
who I-PER
owes I-PER
to I-PER
him I-PER
the I-PER
happiness I-PER
of I-PER
her I-PER
life I-PER
. O
This O
, O
briefly O
, O
is O
his O
story O
. O
Some O
years O
ago O
he O
loved O
a B-PER
young I-PER
Russian I-PER
lady I-PER
of I-PER
moderate I-PER
fortune I-PER
, O
and O
having O
amassed O
a O
considerable O
sum O
in O
prize-money O
, O
the O
father O
of O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
consented O
to O
the O
match O
. O
He O
saw O
his B-PER
mistress I-PER
once O
before O
the O
destined O
ceremony O
; O
but O
she O
was O
bathed O
in O
tears O
, O
and O
throwing O
herself O
at O
his O
feet O
, O
entreated O
him O
to O
spare O
her O
, O
confessing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
loved O
another O
, O
but O
that O
he O
was O
poor O
, O
and O
that O
her B-PER
father I-PER
would O
never O
consent O
to O
the O
union O
. O
My B-PER
generous I-PER
friend I-PER
reassured O
the O
suppliant O
, O
and O
on O
being O
informed O
of O
the O
name O
of O
her B-PER
lover I-PER
, O
instantly O
abandoned O
his O
pursuit O
. O
He O
had O
already O
bought O
a B-FAC
farm I-FAC
with O
his O
money O
, O
on O
which O
he O
had O
designed O
to O
pass O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
life O
; O
but O
he O
bestowed O
the O
whole O
on O
his B-PER
rival I-PER
, O
together O
with O
the O
remains O
of O
his O
prize-money O
to O
purchase O
stock O
, O
and O
then O
himself O
solicited O
the B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
's O
father O
to O
consent O
to O
her O
marriage O
with O
her B-PER
lover I-PER
. O
But O
the B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
decidedly O
refused O
, O
thinking O
himself O
bound O
in O
honour O
to O
my O
friend O
, O
who O
, O
when O
he O
found O
the B-PER
father I-PER
inexorable O
, O
quitted O
his B-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
nor O
returned O
until O
he O
heard O
that O
his B-PER
former I-PER
mistress I-PER
was O
married O
according O
to O
her O
inclinations O
. O
" O
What O
a B-PER
noble I-PER
fellow I-PER
! O
" O
you O
will O
exclaim O
. O
He O
is O
so O
; O
but O
then O
he O
is O
wholly O
uneducated O
: O
he O
is O
as O
silent O
as O
a B-PER
Turk I-PER
, O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
ignorant O
carelessness O
attends O
him O
, O
which O
, O
while O
it O
renders O
his O
conduct O
the O
more O
astonishing O
, O
detracts O
from O
the O
interest O
and O
sympathy O
which O
otherwise O
he O
would O
command O
. O
During O
the O
whole O
of O
a O
dull O
, O
dark O
, O
and O
soundless O
day O
in O
the O
autumn O
of O
the O
year O
, O
when O
the O
clouds O
hung O
oppressively O
low O
in O
the O
heavens O
, O
I O
had O
been O
passing O
alone O
, O
on O
horseback O
, O
through O
a B-LOC
singularly I-LOC
dreary I-LOC
tract I-LOC
of I-LOC
country I-LOC
; O
and O
at O
length O
found O
myself O
, O
as O
the O
shades O
of O
the O
evening O
drew O
on O
, O
within O
view O
of O
the O
melancholy O
House O
of O
Usher B-PER
. O
I O
know O
not O
how O
it O
was O
-- O
but O
, O
with O
the O
first O
glimpse O
of O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
, O
a O
sense O
of O
insufferable O
gloom O
pervaded O
my O
spirit O
. O
I O
say O
insufferable O
; O
for O
the O
feeling O
was O
unrelieved O
by O
any O
of O
that O
half-pleasureable O
, O
because O
poetic O
, O
sentiment O
, O
with O
which O
the O
mind O
usually O
receives O
even O
the O
sternest O
natural O
images O
of O
the O
desolate O
or O
terrible O
. O
I O
looked O
upon O
the O
scene O
before O
me O
-- O
upon O
the B-FAC
mere I-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
and O
the O
simple O
landscape O
features O
of O
the B-FAC
domain I-FAC
-- O
upon O
the O
bleak O
walls O
-- O
upon O
the O
vacant O
eye-like O
windows O
-- O
upon O
a O
few O
rank O
sedges O
-- O
and O
upon O
a O
few O
white O
trunks O
of O
decayed O
trees O
-- O
with O
an O
utter O
depression O
of O
soul O
which O
I O
can O
compare O
to O
no O
earthly O
sensation O
more O
properly O
than O
to O
the O
after-dream O
of O
the B-PER
reveller I-PER
upon O
opium O
-- O
the O
bitter O
lapse O
into O
everyday O
life O
-- O
the O
hideous O
dropping O
off O
of O
the O
veil O
. O
There O
was O
an O
iciness O
, O
a O
sinking O
, O
a O
sickening O
of O
the O
heart O
-- O
an O
unredeemed O
dreariness O
of O
thought O
which O
no O
goading O
of O
the O
imagination O
could O
torture O
into O
aught O
of O
the O
sublime O
. O
What O
was O
it O
-- O
I O
paused O
to O
think O
-- O
what O
was O
it O
that O
so O
unnerved O
me O
in O
the O
contemplation O
of O
the O
House O
of O
Usher B-PER
? O
It O
was O
a O
mystery O
all O
insoluble O
; O
nor O
could O
I O
grapple O
with O
the O
shadowy O
fancies O
that O
crowded O
upon O
me O
as O
I O
pondered O
. O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
fall O
back O
upon O
the O
unsatisfactory O
conclusion O
, O
that O
while O
, O
beyond O
doubt O
, O
there O
are O
combinations O
of O
very O
simple O
natural O
objects O
which O
have O
the O
power O
of O
thus O
affecting O
us O
, O
still O
the O
analysis O
of O
this O
power O
lies O
among O
considerations O
beyond O
our O
depth O
. O
It O
was O
possible O
, O
I O
reflected O
, O
that O
a O
mere O
different O
arrangement O
of O
the O
particulars O
of O
the O
scene O
, O
of O
the O
details O
of O
the O
picture O
, O
would O
be O
sufficient O
to O
modify O
, O
or O
perhaps O
to O
annihilate O
its O
capacity O
for O
sorrowful O
impression O
; O
and O
, O
acting O
upon O
this O
idea O
, O
I O
reined O
my O
horse O
to O
the O
precipitous O
brink O
of O
a O
black O
and O
lurid O
tarn O
that O
lay O
in O
unruffled O
lustre O
by O
the B-FAC
dwelling I-FAC
, O
and O
gazed O
down O
-- O
but O
with O
a O
shudder O
even O
more O
thrilling O
than O
before O
-- O
upon O
the O
remodelled O
and O
inverted O
images O
of O
the O
grey O
sedge O
, O
and O
the O
ghastly O
tree-stems O
, O
and O
the O
vacant O
and O
eye-like O
windows O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
in O
this B-FAC
mansion I-FAC
of I-FAC
gloom I-FAC
I O
now O
proposed O
to O
myself O
a O
sojourn O
of O
some O
weeks O
. O
Its B-PER
proprietor I-PER
, O
Roderick B-PER
Usher I-PER
, O
had O
been O
one O
of O
my B-PER
boon I-PER
companions I-PER
in I-PER
boyhood I-PER
; O
but O
many O
years O
had O
elapsed O
since O
our O
last O
meeting O
. O
A O
letter O
, O
however O
, O
had O
lately O
reached O
me O
in O
a O
distant O
part O
of O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
-- O
a O
letter O
from O
him O
-- O
which O
, O
in O
its O
wildly O
importunate O
nature O
, O
had O
admitted O
of O
no O
other O
than O
a O
personal O
reply O
. O
The O
MS O
gave O
evidence O
of O
nervous O
agitation O
. O
The B-PER
writer I-PER
spoke O
of O
acute O
bodily O
illness O
-- O
of O
a O
mental O
disorder O
which O
oppressed O
him O
-- O
and O
of O
an O
earnest O
desire O
to O
see O
me O
, O
as O
his O
best O
, O
and O
indeed O
his B-PER
only I-PER
personal I-PER
friend I-PER
, O
with O
a O
view O
of O
attempting O
, O
by O
the O
cheerfulness O
of O
my O
society O
, O
some O
alleviation O
of O
his O
malady O
. O
It O
was O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
all O
this O
, O
and O
much O
more O
, O
was O
said O
-- O
it O
was O
the O
apparent O
heart O
that O
went O
with O
his O
request O
-- O
which O
allowed O
me O
no O
room O
for O
hesitation O
; O
and O
I O
accordingly O
obeyed O
forthwith O
what O
I O
still O
considered O
a O
very O
singular O
summons O
. O
Although O
, O
as O
boys B-PER
, O
we O
had O
been O
even O
intimate O
associates O
, O
yet O
I O
really O
knew O
little O
of O
my B-PER
friend I-PER
. O
His O
reserve O
had O
been O
always O
excessive O
and O
habitual O
. O
I O
was O
aware O
, O
however O
, O
that O
his B-PER
very I-PER
ancient I-PER
family I-PER
had O
been O
noted O
, O
time O
out O
of O
mind O
, O
for O
a O
peculiar O
sensibility O
of O
temperament O
, O
displaying O
itself O
, O
through O
long O
ages O
, O
in O
many O
works O
of O
exalted O
art O
, O
and O
manifested O
, O
of O
late O
, O
in O
repeated O
deeds O
of O
munificent O
yet O
unobtrusive O
charity O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
a O
passionate O
devotion O
to O
the O
intricacies O
, O
perhaps O
even O
more O
than O
to O
the O
orthodox O
and O
easily O
recognisable O
beauties O
of O
musical O
science O
. O
I O
had O
learned O
, O
too O
, O
the O
very O
remarkable O
fact O
, O
that O
the O
stem O
of O
the B-PER
Usher I-PER
race I-PER
, O
all O
time-honoured O
as O
it O
was O
, O
had O
put O
forth O
, O
at O
no O
period O
, O
any O
enduring O
branch O
; O
in O
other O
words O
, O
that O
the B-PER
entire I-PER
family I-PER
lay O
in O
the O
direct O
line O
of O
descent O
, O
and O
had O
always O
, O
with O
very O
trifling O
and O
very O
temporary O
variation O
, O
so O
lain O
. O
It O
was O
this O
deficiency O
, O
I O
considered O
, O
while O
running O
over O
in O
thought O
the O
perfect O
keeping O
of O
the O
character O
of O
the B-FAC
premises I-FAC
with O
the O
accredited O
character O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
, O
and O
while O
speculating O
upon O
the O
possible O
influence O
which O
the O
one O
, O
in O
the O
long O
lapse O
of O
centuries O
, O
might O
have O
exercised O
upon O
the O
other O
-- O
it O
was O
this O
deficiency O
, O
perhaps O
, O
of O
collateral O
issue O
, O
and O
the O
consequent O
undeviating O
transmission O
, O
from O
sire B-PER
to O
son B-PER
, O
of O
the O
patrimony O
with O
the O
name O
, O
which O
had O
, O
at O
length O
, O
so O
identified O
the O
two O
as O
to O
merge O
the O
original O
title O
of O
the B-FAC
estate I-FAC
in O
the O
quaint O
and O
equivocal O
appellation O
of O
the O
" O
House O
of O
Usher B-PER
" O
-- O
an O
appellation O
which O
seemed O
to O
include O
, O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the B-PER
peasantry I-PER
who I-PER
used I-PER
it I-PER
, O
both O
the B-PER
family I-PER
and O
the B-FAC
family I-FAC
mansion I-FAC
. O
I O
have O
said O
that O
the O
sole O
effect O
of O
my O
somewhat O
childish O
experiment O
-- O
that O
of O
looking O
down O
within O
the B-LOC
tarn I-LOC
-- O
had O
been O
to O
deepen O
the O
first O
singular O
impression O
. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
consciousness O
of O
the O
rapid O
increase O
of O
my O
superstition O
-- O
for O
why O
should O
I O
not O
so O
term O
it O
? O
-- O
served O
mainly O
to O
accelerate O
the O
increase O
itself O
. O
Such O
, O
I O
have O
long O
known O
, O
is O
the O
paradoxical O
law O
of O
all O
sentiments O
having O
terror O
as O
a O
basis O
. O
And O
it O
might O
have O
been O
for O
this O
reason O
only O
, O
that O
, O
when O
I O
again O
uplifted O
my O
eyes O
to O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
itself I-FAC
, O
from O
its O
image O
in O
the B-LOC
pool I-LOC
, O
there O
grew O
in O
my O
mind O
a O
strange O
fancy O
-- O
a O
fancy O
so O
ridiculous O
, O
indeed O
, O
that O
I O
but O
mention O
it O
to O
show O
the O
vivid O
force O
of O
the O
sensations O
which O
oppressed O
me O
. O
I O
had O
so O
worked O
upon O
my O
imagination O
as O
really O
to O
believe O
that O
about O
the B-FAC
whole I-FAC
mansion I-FAC
and O
domain B-FAC
there O
hung O
an O
atmosphere O
peculiar O
to O
themselves O
and O
their O
immediate O
vicinity O
-- O
an O
atmosphere O
which O
had O
no O
affinity O
with O
the O
air O
of O
heaven O
, O
but O
which O
had O
reeked O
up O
from O
the O
decayed O
trees O
, O
and O
the O
grey O
wall O
, O
and O
the B-LOC
silent I-LOC
tarn I-LOC
-- O
a O
pestilent O
and O
mystic O
vapour O
, O
dull O
, O
sluggish O
, O
faintly O
discernible O
, O
and O
leaden-hued O
. O
Shaking O
off O
from O
my O
spirit O
what O
must O
have O
been O
a O
dream O
, O
I O
scanned O
more O
narrowly O
the O
real O
aspect O
of O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
. O
Its O
principal O
feature O
seemed O
to O
be O
that O
of O
an O
excessive O
antiquity O
. O
The O
discoloration O
of O
ages O
had O
been O
great O
. O
Minute O
fungi O
overspread O
the B-FAC
whole I-FAC
exterior I-FAC
, O
hanging O
in O
a O
fine O
tangled O
web-work O
from O
the O
eaves O
. O
Yet O
all O
this O
was O
apart O
from O
any O
extraordinary O
dilapidation O
. O
No O
portion O
of O
the O
masonry O
had O
fallen O
; O
and O
there O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
wild O
inconsistency O
between O
its O
still O
perfect O
adaptation O
of O
parts O
, O
and O
the O
crumbling O
condition O
of O
the O
individual O
stones O
. O
In O
this O
there O
was O
much O
that O
reminded O
me O
of O
the O
specious O
totality O
of O
old O
wood-work O
which O
has O
rotted O
for O
long O
years O
in O
some O
neglected O
vault O
, O
with O
no O
disturbance O
from O
the O
breath O
of O
the O
external O
air O
. O
Beyond O
this O
indication O
of O
extensive O
decay O
, O
however O
, O
the O
fabric O
gave O
little O
token O
of O
instability O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
eye O
of O
a B-PER
scrutinizing I-PER
observer I-PER
might O
have O
discovered O
a O
barely O
perceptible O
fissure O
, O
which O
, O
extending O
from O
the O
roof O
of O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
in I-FAC
front I-FAC
, O
made O
its O
way O
down O
the O
wall O
in O
a O
zigzag O
direction O
, O
until O
it O
became O
lost O
in O
the B-LOC
sullen I-LOC
waters I-LOC
of I-LOC
the I-LOC
tarn I-LOC
. O
Noticing O
these O
things O
, O
I O
rode O
over O
a B-FAC
short I-FAC
causeway I-FAC
to O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
A B-PER
servant I-PER
in I-PER
waiting I-PER
took O
my O
horse O
, O
and O
I O
entered O
the O
Gothic O
archway O
of O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
. O
A B-PER
valet I-PER
, I-PER
of I-PER
stealthy I-PER
step I-PER
, O
thence O
conducted O
me O
, O
in O
silence O
, O
through O
many B-FAC
dark I-FAC
and I-FAC
intricate I-FAC
passages I-FAC
in O
my O
progress O
to O
the O
studio O
of O
his B-PER
master I-PER
. O
Much O
that O
I O
encountered O
on O
the O
way O
contributed O
, O
I O
know O
not O
how O
, O
to O
heighten O
the O
vague O
sentiments O
of O
which O
I O
have O
already O
spoken O
. O
While O
the O
objects O
around O
me O
-- O
while O
the O
carvings O
of O
the O
ceilings O
, O
the O
sombre O
tapestries O
of O
the O
walls O
, O
the O
ebon O
blackness O
of O
the O
floors O
, O
and O
the O
phantasmagoric O
armorial O
trophies O
which O
rattled O
as O
I O
strode O
, O
were O
but O
matters O
to O
which O
, O
or O
to O
such O
as O
which O
, O
I O
had O
been O
accustomed O
from O
my O
infancy O
-- O
while O
I O
hesitated O
not O
to O
acknowledge O
how O
familiar O
was O
all O
this O
-- O
I O
still O
wondered O
to O
find O
how O
unfamiliar O
were O
the O
fancies O
which O
ordinary O
images O
were O
stirring O
up O
. O
On O
one B-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
staircases I-FAC
, O
I O
met O
the O
physician O
of O
the B-PER
family I-PER
. O
His O
countenance O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
wore O
a O
mingled O
expression O
of O
low O
cunning O
and O
perplexity O
. O
He O
accosted O
me O
with O
trepidation O
and O
passed O
on O
. O
The B-PER
valet I-PER
now O
threw O
open O
a O
door O
and O
ushered O
me O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
his B-PER
master I-PER
. O
The B-FAC
room I-FAC
in I-FAC
which I-FAC
I I-FAC
found I-FAC
myself I-FAC
was O
very O
large O
and O
lofty O
. O
The O
windows O
were O
long O
, O
narrow O
, O
and O
pointed O
, O
and O
at O
so O
vast O
a O
distance O
from O
the O
black O
oaken O
floor O
as O
to O
be O
altogether O
inaccessible O
from O
within O
. O
Feeble O
gleams O
of O
encrimsoned O
light O
made O
their O
way O
through O
the O
trellised O
panes O
, O
and O
served O
to O
render O
sufficiently O
distinct O
the O
more O
prominent O
objects O
around O
; O
the O
eye O
, O
however O
, O
struggled O
in O
vain O
to O
reach O
the O
remoter O
angles O
of O
the B-FAC
chamber I-FAC
, O
or O
the O
recesses O
of O
the O
vaulted O
and O
fretted O
ceiling O
. O
Dark O
draperies O
hung O
upon O
the O
walls O
. O
The O
general O
furniture O
was O
profuse O
, O
comfortless O
, O
antique O
, O
and O
tattered O
. O
Many O
books O
and O
musical O
instruments O
lay O
scattered O
about O
, O
but O
failed O
to O
give O
any O
vitality O
to O
the O
scene O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
breathed O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
sorrow O
. O
An O
air O
of O
stern O
, O
deep O
, O
and O
irredeemable O
gloom O
hung O
over O
and O
pervaded O
all O
. O
Upon O
my O
entrance O
, O
Usher B-PER
rose O
from O
a O
sofa O
on O
which O
he O
had O
been O
lying O
at O
full O
length O
, O
and O
greeted O
me O
with O
a O
vivacious O
warmth O
which O
had O
much O
in O
it O
, O
I O
at O
first O
thought O
, O
of O
an O
overdone O
cordiality O
-- O
of O
the O
constrained O
effort O
of O
the O
ennuye O
man O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
A O
glance O
, O
however O
, O
at O
his O
countenance O
, O
convinced O
me O
of O
his O
perfect O
sincerity O
. O
We O
sat O
down O
; O
and O
for O
some O
moments O
, O
while O
he O
spoke O
not O
, O
I O
gazed O
upon O
him O
with O
a O
feeling O
half O
of O
pity O
, O
half O
of O
awe O
. O
Surely O
, O
man B-PER
had O
never O
before O
so O
terribly O
altered O
, O
in O
so O
brief O
a O
period O
, O
as O
had O
Roderick B-PER
Usher I-PER
! O
It O
was O
with O
difficulty O
that O
I O
could O
bring O
myself O
to O
admit O
the O
identity O
of O
the B-PER
wan I-PER
being I-PER
before I-PER
me I-PER
with O
the B-PER
companion I-PER
of I-PER
my I-PER
early I-PER
boyhood I-PER
. O
Yet O
the O
character O
of O
his O
face O
had O
been O
at O
all O
times O
remarkable O
. O
A O
cadaverousness O
of O
complexion O
; O
an O
eye O
large O
, O
liquid O
, O
and O
luminous O
beyond O
comparison O
; O
lips O
somewhat O
thin O
and O
very O
pallid O
, O
but O
of O
a O
surpassingly O
beautiful O
curve O
; O
a O
nose O
of O
a O
delicate O
Hebrew O
model O
, O
but O
with O
a O
breadth O
of O
nostril O
unusual O
in O
similar O
formations O
; O
a O
finely-moulded O
chin O
, O
speaking O
, O
in O
its O
want O
of O
prominence O
, O
of O
a O
want O
of O
moral O
energy O
; O
hair O
of O
a O
more O
than O
web-like O
softness O
and O
tenuity O
; O
these O
features O
, O
with O
an O
inordinate O
expansion O
above O
the O
regions O
of O
the O
temple O
, O
made O
up O
altogether O
a O
countenance O
not O
easily O
to O
be O
forgotten O
. O
And O
now O
in O
the O
mere O
exaggeration O
of O
the O
prevailing O
character O
of O
these O
features O
, O
and O
of O
the O
expression O
they O
were O
wont O
to O
convey O
, O
lay O
so O
much O
of O
change O
that O
I O
doubted O
to O
whom O
I O
spoke O
. O
The O
now O
ghastly O
pallor O
of O
the O
skin O
, O
and O
the O
now O
miraculous O
lustre O
of O
the O
eye O
, O
above O
all O
things O
startled O
and O
even O
awed O
me O
. O
The O
silken O
hair O
, O
too O
, O
had O
been O
suffered O
to O
grow O
all O
unheeded O
, O
and O
as O
, O
in O
its O
wild O
gossamer O
texture O
, O
it O
floated O
rather O
than O
fell O
about O
the O
face O
, O
I O
could O
not O
, O
even O
with O
effort O
, O
connect O
its O
Arabesque O
expression O
with O
any O

The O
Return O
THERE O
WAS O
SOMETHING O
about O
the B-GPE
coast I-GPE
town I-GPE
of I-GPE
Dunnet I-GPE
which O
made O
it O
seem O
more O
attractive O
than O
other O
maritime O
villages O
of O
eastern B-LOC
Maine I-LOC
. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
the O
simple O
fact O
of O
acquaintance O
with O
that B-FAC
neighborhood I-FAC
which O
made O
it O
so O
attaching O
, O
and O
gave O
such O
interest O
to O
the B-LOC
rocky I-LOC
shore I-LOC
and O
dark B-LOC
woods I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
few O
houses O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
securely O
wedged O
and O
tree-nailed O
in O
among O
the O
ledges O
by O
the B-LOC
Landing I-LOC
. O
These B-FAC
houses I-FAC
made O
the O
most O
of O
their O
seaward O
view O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
gayety O
and O
determined O
floweriness O
in O
their O
bits O
of O
garden B-FAC
ground I-FAC
; O
the O
small-paned O
high O
windows O
in O
the O
peaks O
of O
their O
steep O
gables O
were O
like O
knowing O
eyes O
that O
watched O
the B-FAC
harbor I-FAC
and O
the B-LOC
far I-LOC
sea-line I-LOC
beyond O
, O
or O
looked O
northward O
all O
along O
the B-LOC
shore I-LOC
and O
its B-LOC
background I-LOC
of I-LOC
spruces I-LOC
and I-LOC
balsam I-LOC
firs I-LOC

When O
one O
really O
knows O
a B-GPE
village I-GPE
like I-GPE
this I-GPE
and O
its B-LOC
surroundings I-LOC
, O
it O
is O
like O
becoming O
acquainted O
with O
a B-PER
single I-PER
person I-PER
. O
The O
process O
of O
falling O
in O
love O
at O
first O
sight O
is O
as O
final O
as O
it O
is O
swift O
in O
such O
a O
case O

but O
the O
growth O
of O
true O
friendship O
may O
be O
a O
lifelong O
affair O

brief O

two O

the B-LOC

the O

quaintness O
of O
the B-GPE

its I-GPE

all O
that O

her O

evening O

a B-PER

landed O
upon O
the B-FAC

LATER O
, O
THERE O
WAS O
only O
one O
fault O
to O
find O
with O
this O
choice O
of O
a B-LOC
summer I-LOC
lodging-place I-LOC
, O
and O
that O
was O
its O
complete O
lack O
of O
seclusion O
. O
At O
first O
the O
tiny O
house O
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Almira O
Todd O
, O
which O
stood O
with O
its O
end O
to O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
, O
appeared O
to O
be O
retired O
and O
sheltered O
enough O
from O
the B-LOC
busy I-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
behind O
its O
bushy O
bit O
of O
a B-FAC
green I-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
in O
which O
all O
the O
blooming O
things O
, O
two O
or O
three O
gay O
hollyhocks O
and O
some O
London-pride O
, O
were O
pushed O
back O
against O
the O
gray-shingled O
wall O
. O
It O
was O
a B-FAC
queer I-FAC
little I-FAC
garden I-FAC
and O
puzzling O
to O
a B-PER
stranger I-PER
, O
the O
few O
flowers O
being O
put O
at O
a O
disadvantage O
by O
so O
much O
greenery O
; O
but O
the O
discovery O
was O
soon O
made O
that O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
was O
an O
ardent O
lover O
of O
herbs O
, O
both O
wild O
and O
tame O
, O
and O
the O
sea-breezes O
blew O
into O
the O
low O
end-window O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
laden O
with O
not O
only O
sweet-brier O
and O
sweet-mary O
, O
but O
balm O
and O
sage O
and O
borage O
and O
mint O
, O
wormwood O
and O
southernwood O
. O
If O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
had O
occasion O
to O
step O
into O
the O
far O
corner O
of O
her B-FAC
herb I-FAC
plot I-FAC
, O
she O
trod O
heavily O
upon O
thyme O
, O
and O
made O
its O
fragrant O
presence O
known O
with O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
Being O
a B-PER
very I-PER
large I-PER
person I-PER
, O
her O
full O
skirts O
brushed O
and O
bent O
almost O
every O
slender O
stalk O
that O
her O
feet O
missed O
. O
You O
could O
always O
tell O
when O
she O
was O
stepping O
about O
there O
, O
even O
when O
you O
were O
half O
awake O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
learned O
to O
know O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
’ O
experience O
, O
in O
exactly O
which O
corner O
of O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
she O
might O
be O
. O
At O
one O
side O
of O
this B-FAC
herb I-FAC
plot I-FAC
were O
other O
growths O
of O
a O
rustic O
pharmacopoeia O
, O
great O
treasures O
and O
rarities O
among O
the O
commoner O
herbs O
. O
There O
were O
some O
strange O
and O
pungent O
odors O
that O
roused O
a O
dim O
sense O
and O
remembrance O
of O
something O
in O
the O
forgotten O
past O
. O
Some O
of O
these O
might O
once O
have O
belonged O
to O
sacred O
and O
mystic O
rites O
, O
and O
have O
had O
some O
occult O
knowledge O
handed O
with O
them O
down O
the O
centuries O
; O
but O
now O
they O
pertained O
only O
to O
humble O
compounds O
brewed O
at O
intervals O
with O
molasses O
or O
vinegar O
or O
spirits O
in O
a O
small O
caldron O
on O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
’s O
kitchen B-FAC
stove O
. O
They O
were O
dispensed O
to O
suffering B-PER
neighbors I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
usually I-PER
came I-PER
at I-PER
night I-PER
as I-PER
if I-PER
by I-PER
stealth I-PER
, I-PER
bringing I-PER
their I-PER
own I-PER
ancient-looking I-PER
vials I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
filled I-PER
. O
One O
nostrum O
was O
called O
the O
Indian O
remedy O
, O
and O
its O
price O
was O
but O
fifteen O
cents O
; O
the O
whispered O
directions O
could O
be O
heard O
as O
customers B-PER
passed O
the O
windows O
. O
With O
most O
remedies O
the B-PER
purchaser I-PER
was O
allowed O
to O
depart O
unadmonished O
from O
the B-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
being O
a B-PER
wise I-PER
saver I-PER
of I-PER
steps I-PER
; O
but O
with O
certain O
vials O
she O
gave O
cautions O
, O
standing O
in O
the O
doorway O
, O
and O
there O
were O
other O
doses O
which O
had O
to O
be O
accompanied O
on O
their O
healing O
way O
as O
far O
as O
the O
gate O
, O
while O
she O
muttered O
long O
chapters O
of O
directions O
, O
and O
kept O
up O
an O
air O
of O
secrecy O
and O
importance O
to O
the O
last O
. O
It O
may O
not O
have O
been O
only O
the O
common O
aids O
of O
humanity O
with O
which O
she O
tried O
to O
cope O
; O
it O
seemed O
sometimes O
as O
if O
love O
and O
hate O
and O
jealousy O
and O
adverse O
winds O
at O
sea B-LOC
might O
also O
find O
their O
proper O
remedies O
among O
the O
curious O
wild-looking O
plants O
in O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
’s O
garden O
. O
The O
village B-GPE
doctor O
and O
this B-PER
learned I-PER
herbalist I-PER
were O
upon O
the O
best O
of O
terms O
. O
The B-PER
good I-PER
man I-PER
may O
have O
counted O
upon O
the O
unfavorable O
effect O
of O
certain O
potions O
which O
he O
should O
find O
his O
opportunity O
in O
counteracting O
; O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
he O
now O
and O
then O
stopped O
and O
exchanged O
greetings O
with O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
over O
the O
picket O
fence O
. O
The O
conversation O
became O
at O
once O
professional O
after O
the O
briefest O
preliminaries O
, O
and O
he O
would O
stand O
twirling O
a O
sweet-scented O
sprig O
in O
his O
fingers O
, O
and O
make O
suggestive O
jokes O
, O
perhaps O
about O
her O
faith O
in O
a O
too O
persistent O
course O
of O
thoroughwort O
elixir O
, O
in O
which O
my B-PER
landlady I-PER
professed O
such O
firm O
belief O
as O
sometimes O
to O
endanger O
the O
life O
and O
usefulness O
of O
worthy B-PER
neighbors I-PER
. O
To O
arrive O
at O
this B-GPE
quietest I-GPE
of I-GPE
seaside I-GPE
villages I-GPE
late O
in O
June O
, O
when O
the O
busy O
herb-gathering O
season O
was O
just O
beginning O
, O
was O
also O
to O
arrive O
in O
the O
early O
prime O
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
’s O
activity O
in O
the O
brewing O
of O
old-fashioned O
spruce O
beer O
. O
This O
cooling O
and O
refreshing O
drink O
had O
been O
brought O
to O
wonderful O
perfection O
through O
a O
long O
series O
of O
experiments O
; O
it O
had O
won O
immense O
local O
fame O
, O
and O
the O
supplies O
for O
its O
manufacture O
were O
always O
giving O
out O
and O
having O
to O
be O
replenished O
. O
For O
various O
reasons O
, O
the O
seclusion O
and O
uninterrupted O
days O
which O
had O
been O
looked O
forward O
to O
proved O
to O
be O
very O
rare O
in O
this O
otherwise O
delightful O
corner O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
My B-PER
hostess I-PER
and O
I O
had O
made O
our O
shrewd O
business O
agreement O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
simple O
cold O
luncheon O
at O
noon O
, O
and O
liberal O
restitution O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
hot O
suppers O
, O
to O
provide O
for O
which O
the B-PER
lodger I-PER
might O
sometimes O
be O
seen O
hurrying O
down O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
, O
late O
in O
the O
day O
, O
with O
cunner O
line O
in O
hand O
. O
It O
was O
soon O
found O
that O
this O
arrangement O
made O
large O
allowance O
for O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
’s O
slow O
herb-gathering O
progresses O
through O
woods B-LOC
and O
pastures B-LOC
. O
The B-PER
spruce-beer I-PER
customers I-PER
were O
pretty O
steady O
in O
hot O
weather O
, O
and O
there O
were O
many O
demands O
for O
different O
soothing O
syrups O
and O
elixirs O
with O
which O
the O
unwise O
curiosity O
of O
my O
early O
residence O
had O
made O
me O
acquainted O
. O
Knowing O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
to O
be O
a B-PER
widow I-PER
, O
who O
had O
little O
beside O
this O
slender O
business O
and O
the O
income O
from O
one B-PER
hungry I-PER
lodger I-PER
to O
maintain O
her O
, O
one O
’s O
energies O
and O
even O
interest O
were O
quickly O
bestowed O
, O
until O
it O
became O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
that O
she O
should O
go O
afield O
every O
pleasant O
day O
, O
and O
that O
the B-PER
lodger I-PER
should O
answer O
all O
peremptory O
knocks O
at O
the O
side O
door O
. O
In O
taking O
an O
occasional O
wisdom-giving O
stroll O
in O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O

company O
, O
and O
in O
acting O
as O
business B-PER
partner I-PER
during O
her O
frequent O
absences O
, O
I O
found O
the O
July O
days O
fly O
fast O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
I O
felt O
myself O
confronted O
with O
too O
great O
pride O
and O
pleasure O
in O
the O
display O
, O
one O
night O
, O
of O
two O
dollars O
and O
twenty-seven O
cents O
which O
I O
had O
taken O
in O
during O
the O
day O
, O
that O
I O
remembered O
a O
long O
piece O
of O
writing O
, O
sadly O
belated O
now O
, O
which O
I O
was O
bound O
to O
do O
. O
To O
have O
been O
patted O
kindly O
on O
the O
shoulder O
and O
called O
“ O
darlin B-PER
’ O
, O
” O
to O
have O
been O
offered O
a O
surprise O
of O
early O
mushrooms O
for O
supper O
, O
to O
have O
had O
all O
the O
glory O
of O
making O
two O
dollars O
and O
twenty-seven O
cents O
in O
a O
single O
day O
, O
and O
then O
to O
renounce O
it O
all O
and O
withdraw O
from O
these O
pleasant O
successes O
, O
needed O
much O
resolution O
. O
Literary O
employments O
are O
so O
vexed O
with O
uncertainties O
at O
best O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
the O
voice O
of O
conscience O
sounded O
louder O
in O
my O
ears O
than O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
on O
the B-LOC
nearest I-LOC
pebble I-LOC
beach I-LOC
that O
I O
said O
unkind O
words O
of O
withdrawal O
to O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
. O
She O
only O
became O
more O
wistfully O
affectionate O
than O
ever O
in O
her O
expressions O
, O
and O
looked O
as O
disappointed O
as O
I O
expected O
when O
I O
frankly O
told O
her O
that O
I O
could O
no O
longer O
enjoy O
the O
pleasure O
of O
what O
we O
called O
“ O
seein O
’ O
folks B-PER
. O
” O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
cruel O
to O
a B-PER
whole I-PER
neighborhood I-PER
in O
curtailing O
her O
liberty O
in O
this O
most O
important O
season O
for O
harvesting O
the O
different O
wild O
herbs O
that O
were O
so O
much O
counted O
upon O
to O
ease O
their O
winter O
ails O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
dear B-PER

she O
said O
sorrowfully O
, O
“ O

Mrs. B-PER
Todd O

I O
were O
not O
separated O

estranged O
by O
the O
change O
in O
our O
business O
relations O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
a O
deeper O
intimacy O
seemed O
to O
begin O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
herb O
of O
the O
night O
it O
was O
that O
used O
sometimes O
to O
send O
out O
a O
penetrating O
odor O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
after O
the O
dew O
had O
fallen O
, O
and O
the O
moon O
was O
high O
, O
and O
the O
cool O
air O
came O
up O
from O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC

Then O
Mrs. B-PER
Todd O
would O
feel O
that O
she O
must O
talk O
to O
somebody B-PER
, O
and O
I O
was O
only O
too O
glad O
to O
listen O

We O
both O
fell O
under O
the O
spell O

and O
she O
either O
stood O
outside O
the O
window O
, O
or O
made O
an O
errand O
to O
my B-FAC
sitting-room I-FAC

and O
told O
, O
it O
might O
be O
very O
commonplace O
news O
of O
the O
day O

or O
, O
as O
happened O
one O
misty O
summer O
night O

all O
that O
lay O
deepest O
in O
her O

It O
was O
in O
this O

that O
I O
came O
to O

. O
Miss B-PER
Brooke O
had O
that O
kind O
of O
beauty O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
thrown O
into O
relief O
by O
poor O
dress O
. O
Her O
hand O
and O
wrist O
were O
so O
finely O
formed O
that O
she O
could O
wear O
sleeves O
not O
less O
bare O
of O
style O
than O
those O
in O
which O
the B-PER
Blessed I-PER
Virgin I-PER
appeared O
to O
Italian B-PER
painters I-PER
; O
and O
her O
profile O
as O
well O
as O
her O
stature O
and O
bearing O
seemed O
to O
gain O
the O
more O
dignity O
from O
her O
plain O
garments O
, O
which O
by O
the B-FAC
side I-FAC
of I-FAC
provincial I-FAC
fashion I-FAC
gave O
her O
the O
impressiveness O
of O
a O
fine O
quotation O
from O
the O
Bible O
, O
-- O
or O
from O
one O
of O
our B-PER
elder I-PER
poets I-PER
, O
-- O
in O
a O
paragraph O
of O
to-day O
's O
newspaper O
. O
She O
was O
usually O
spoken O
of O
as O
being O
remarkably O
clever O
, O
but O
with O
the O
addition O
that O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
Celia B-PER
had O
more O
common-sense O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
Celia B-PER
wore O
scarcely O
more O
trimmings O
; O
and O
it O
was O
only O
to O
close B-PER
observers I-PER
that O
her O
dress O
differed O
from O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
's O
, O
and O
had O
a O
shade O
of O
coquetry O
in O
its O
arrangements O
; O
for O
Miss B-PER
Brooke O
's O
plain O
dressing O
was O
due O
to O
mixed O
conditions O
, O
in O
most O
of O
which O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
shared O
. O
The O
pride O
of O
being O
ladies B-PER
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
it O
: O
the O
Brooke B-PER
connections O
, O
though O
not O
exactly O
aristocratic O
, O
were O
unquestionably O
" O
good O
: O
" O
if O
you O
inquired O
backward O
for O
a O
generation O
or O
two O
, O
you O
would O
not O
find O
any O
yard-measuring O
or O
parcel-tying O
forefathers B-PER
-- O
anything O
lower O
than O
an B-PER
admiral I-PER
or O
a O
clergyman B-PER
; O
and O
there O
was O
even O
an B-PER
ancestor I-PER
discernible O
as O
a O
Puritan O
gentleman O
who O
served O
under O
Cromwell B-PER
, O
but O
afterwards O
conformed O
, O
and O
managed O
to O
come O
out O
of O
all O
political O
troubles O
as O
the B-PER
proprietor I-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
respectable I-PER
family I-PER
estate I-PER
. O
Young B-PER
women I-PER
of I-PER
such I-PER
birth I-PER
, O
living O
in O
a B-FAC
quiet I-FAC
country-house I-FAC
, O
and O
attending O
a B-FAC
village I-FAC
church I-FAC
hardly O
larger O
than O
a B-FAC
parlor I-FAC
, O
naturally O
regarded O
frippery O
as O
the O
ambition O
of O
a B-PER
huckster I-PER
's O
daughter O
. O
Then O
there O
was O
well-bred O
economy O
, O
which O
in O
those O
days O
made O
show O
in O
dress O
the O
first O
item O
to O
be O
deducted O
from O
, O
when O
any O
margin O
was O
required O
for O
expenses O
more O
distinctive O
of O
rank O
. O
Such O
reasons O
would O
have O
been O
enough O
to O
account O
for O
plain O
dress O
, O
quite O
apart O
from O
religious O
feeling O
; O
but O
in O
Miss B-PER
Brooke O
's O
case O
, O
religion O
alone O
would O
have O
determined O
it O
; O
and O
Celia B-PER
mildly O
acquiesced O
in O
all O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
's O
sentiments O
, O
only O
infusing O
them O
with O
that O
common-sense O
which O
is O
able O
to O
accept O
momentous O
doctrines O
without O
any O
eccentric O
agitation O
. O
Dorothea B-PER
knew O
many O
passages O
of O
Pascal B-PER
's O
Pensees O
and O
of O
Jeremy B-PER
Taylor I-PER
by O
heart O
; O
and O
to O
her O
the O
destinies O
of O
mankind B-PER
, O
seen O
by O
the O
light O
of O
Christianity O
, O
made O
the O
solicitudes O
of O
feminine O
fashion O
appear O
an O
occupation O
for O
Bedlam O
. O
She O
could O
not O
reconcile O
the O
anxieties O
of O
a O
spiritual O
life O
involving O
eternal O
consequences O
, O
with O
a O
keen O
interest O
in O
gimp O
and O
artificial O
protrusions O
of O
drapery O
. O
Her O
mind O
was O
theoretic O
, O
and O
yearned O
by O
its O
nature O
after O
some O
lofty O
conception O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
which O
might O
frankly O
include O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
of O
Tipton B-GPE
and O
her O
own O
rule O
of O
conduct O
there B-GPE
; O
she O
was O
enamoured O
of O
intensity O
and O
greatness O
, O
and O
rash O
in O
embracing O
whatever O
seemed O
to O
her O
to O
have O
those O
aspects O
; O
likely O
to O
seek O
martyrdom O
, O
to O
make O
retractations O
, O
and O
then O
to O
incur O
martyrdom O
after O
all O
in O
a O
quarter O
where O
she O
had O
not O
sought O
it O
. O
Certainly O
such O
elements O
in O
the O
character O
of O
a B-PER
marriageable I-PER
girl I-PER
tended O
to O
interfere O
with O
her B-PER
lot I-PER
, O
and O
hinder O
it O
from O
being O
decided O
according O
to O
custom O
, O
by O
good O
looks O
, O
vanity O
, O
and O
merely O
canine O
affection O
. O
With O
all O
this O
, O
she O
, O
the O
elder O
of O
the B-PER
sisters I-PER
, O
was O
not O
yet O
twenty O
, O
and O
they O
had O
both O
been O
educated O
, O
since O
they O
were O
about O
twelve O
years O
old O
and O
had O
lost O
their B-PER
parents I-PER
, O
on O
plans O
at O
once O
narrow O
and O
promiscuous O
, O
first O
in O
an B-PER
English I-PER
family I-PER
and O
afterwards O
in O
a O
Swiss O
family O
at O
Lausanne B-GPE
, O
their B-PER
bachelor I-PER
uncle I-PER
and I-PER
guardian I-PER
trying O
in O
this O
way O
to O
remedy O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
their O
orphaned O
condition O
. O
It O
was O
hardly O
a O
year O
since O
they O
had O
come O
to O
live O
at O
Tipton B-FAC
Grange I-FAC
with O
their B-PER
uncle I-PER
, O
a B-PER
man I-PER
nearly I-PER
sixty I-PER
, O
of O
acquiescent O
temper O
, O
miscellaneous O
opinions O
, O
and O
uncertain O
vote O
. O
He O
had O
travelled O
in O
his O
younger O
years O
, O
and O
was O
held O
in O
this O
part O
of O
the B-GPE
county I-GPE
to O
have O
contracted O
a O
too O
rambling O
habit O
of O
mind O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Brooke O
's O
conclusions O
were O
as O
difficult O
to O
predict O
as O
the O
weather O
: O
it O
was O
only O
safe O
to O
say O
that O
he O
would O
act O
with O
benevolent O
intentions O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
spend O
as O
little O
money O
as O
possible O
in O
carrying O
them O
out O
. O
For O
the O
most O
glutinously O
indefinite O
minds O
enclose O
some O
hard O
grains O
of O
habit O
; O
and O
a B-PER
man I-PER
has O
been O
seen O
lax O
about O
all O
his O
own O
interests O
except O
the O
retention O
of O
his O
snuff-box O
, O
concerning O
which O
he O
was O
watchful O
, O
suspicious O
, O
and O
greedy O
of O
clutch O
. O
In O
Mr. B-PER
Brooke O
the O
hereditary O
strain O
of O
Puritan O
energy O
was O
clearly O
in O
abeyance O
; O
but O
in O
his B-PER
niece I-PER
Dorothea B-PER
it O
glowed O
alike O
through O
faults O
and O
virtues O
, O
turning O
sometimes O
into O
impatience O
of O
her B-PER
uncle I-PER
's O
talk O
or O
his O
way O
of O
" O
letting O
things O
be O
" O
on O
his O
estate O
, O
and O
making O
her O
long O
all O
the O
more O
for O
the O
time O
when O
she O
would O
be O
of O
age O
and O
have O
some O
command O
of O
money O
for O
generous O
schemes O
. O
She O
was O
regarded O
as O
an B-PER
heiress I-PER
; O
for O
not O
only O
had O
the B-PER
sisters I-PER
seven O
hundred O
a-year O
each O
from O
their B-PER
parents I-PER
, O
but O
if O
Dorothea B-PER
married O
and O
had O
a B-PER
son I-PER
, O
that B-PER
son I-PER
would O
inherit O
Mr. B-PER
Brooke O
's O
estate O
, O
presumably O
worth O
about O
three O
thousand O
a-year O
-- O
a O
rental O
which O
seemed O
wealth O
to O
provincial B-PER
families I-PER
, O
still O
discussing O
Mr. B-PER
Peel O
's O
late O
conduct O
on O
the O
Catholic B-PER
question O
, O
innocent O
of O
future O
gold-fields O
, O
and O
of O
that O
gorgeous O
plutocracy O
which O
has O
so O
nobly O
exalted O
the O
necessities O
of O
genteel O
life O
. O
And O
how O
should O
Dorothea B-PER
not O
marry O
? O
-- O
a B-PER
girl I-PER
so I-PER
handsome I-PER
and I-PER
with I-PER
such I-PER
prospects I-PER
? O
Nothing O
could O
hinder O
it O
but O
her O
love O
of O
extremes O
, O
and O
her O
insistence O
on O
regulating O
life O
according O
to O
notions O
which O
might O
cause O
a B-PER
wary I-PER
man I-PER
to O
hesitate O
before O
he O
made O
her O
an O
offer O
, O
or O
even O
might O
lead O
her O
at O
last O
to O
refuse O
all O
offers O
. O
A B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
of I-PER
some I-PER
birth I-PER
and I-PER
fortune I-PER
, O
who O
knelt O
suddenly O
down O
on O
a O
brick O
floor O
by O
the O
side O
of O
a B-PER
sick I-PER
laborer I-PER
and O
prayed O
fervidly O
as O
if O
she O
thought O
herself O
living O
in O
the O
time O
of O
the B-PER
Apostles I-PER
-- O
who O
had O
strange O
whims O
of O
fasting O
like O
a B-PER
Papist I-PER
, O
and O
of O
sitting O
up O
at O
night O
to O
read O
old O
theological O
books O
! O
Such B-PER
a I-PER
wife I-PER
might O
awaken O
you O
some O
fine O
morning O
with O
a O
new O
scheme O
for O
the O
application O
of O
her O
income O
which O
would O
interfere O
with O
political O
economy O
and O
the O
keeping O
of O
saddle-horses O
: O
a B-PER
man I-PER
would O
naturally O
think O
twice O
before O
he O
risked O
himself O
in O
such O
fellowship O
. O
Women B-PER
were O
expected O
to O
have O
weak O
opinions O
; O
but O
the O
great O
safeguard O
of O
society O
and O
of O
domestic O
life O
was O
, O
that O
opinions O
were O
not O
acted O
on O
. O
Sane B-PER
people I-PER
did O
what O
their B-PER
neighbors I-PER
did O
, O
so O
that O
if O
any B-PER
lunatics I-PER
were O
at O
large O
, O
one O
might O
know O
and O
avoid O
them O
. O
The O
rural O
opinion O
about O
the B-PER
new I-PER
young I-PER
ladies I-PER
, O
even O
among O
the B-PER
cottagers I-PER
, O
was O
generally O
in O
favor O
of O
Celia B-PER
, O
as O
being O
so O
amiable O
and O
innocent-looking O
, O
while O
Miss B-PER
Brooke O
's O
large O
eyes O
seemed O
, O
like O
her O
religion O
, O
too O
unusual O
and O
striking O
. O
Poor O
Dorothea B-PER
! O
compared O
with O
her O
, O
the B-PER
innocent-looking I-PER
Celia I-PER
was O
knowing O
and O
worldly-wise O
; O
so O
much O
subtler O
is O
a O
human O
mind O
than O
the O
outside O
tissues O
which O
make O
a O
sort O
of O
blazonry O
or O
clock-face O
for O
it O
. O
Yet O
those O
who O
approached O
Dorothea B-PER
, O
though O
prejudiced O
against O
her O
by O
this O
alarming O
hearsay O
, O
found O
that O
she O
had O
a O
charm O
unaccountably O
reconcilable O
with O
it O
. O
Most B-PER
men I-PER
thought O
her O
bewitching O
when O
she O
was O
on O
horseback O
. O
She O
loved O
the O
fresh O
air O
and O
the O
various O
aspects O
of O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
and O
when O
her O
eyes O
and O
cheeks O
glowed O
with O
mingled O
pleasure O
she O
looked O
very O
little O
like O
a B-PER
devotee I-PER
. O
Riding O
was O
an O
indulgence O
which O
she O
allowed O
herself O
in O
spite O
of O
conscientious O
qualms O
; O
she O
felt O
that O
she O
enjoyed O
it O
in O
a O
pagan O
sensuous O
way O
, O
and O
always O
looked O
forward O
to O
renouncing O
it O
. O
She O
was O
open O
, O
ardent O
, O
and O
not O
in O
the O
least O
self-admiring O
; O
indeed O
, O
it O
was O
pretty O
to O
see O
how O
her O
imagination O
adorned O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
Celia B-PER
with O
attractions O
altogether O
superior O
to O
her O
own O
, O
and O
if O
any B-PER
gentleman I-PER
appeared O
to O
come O
to O
the B-FAC
Grange I-FAC
from O
some O
other O
motive O
than O
that O
of O
seeing O
Mr. B-PER
Brooke O
, O
she O
concluded O
that O
he O
must O
be O
in O
love O
with O
Celia B-PER
: O
Sir B-PER
James O
Chettam O
, O
for O
example O
, O
whom O
she O
constantly O
considered O
from O
Celia B-PER
's O
point O
of O
view O
, O
inwardly O
debating O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
good O
for O
Celia B-PER
to O
accept O
him O
. O
That O
he O
should O
be O
regarded O
as O
a B-PER
suitor I-PER
to I-PER
herself I-PER
would O
have O
seemed O
to O
her O
a O
ridiculous O
irrelevance O
. O
Dorothea B-PER
, O
with O
all O
her O
eagerness O
to O
know O
the O
truths O
of O
life O
, O
retained O
very O
childlike O
ideas O
about O
marriage O
. O
She O
felt O
sure O
that O
she O
would O
have O
accepted O
the B-PER
judicious I-PER
Hooker I-PER
, O
if O
she O
had O
been O
born O
in O
time O
to O
save O
him O
from O
that O
wretched O
mistake O
he O
made O
in O
matrimony O
; O
or O
John B-PER
Milton I-PER
when O
his O
blindness O
had O
come O
on O
; O
or O
any B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
other I-PER
great I-PER
men I-PER
whose I-PER
odd I-PER
habits I-PER
it I-PER
would I-PER
have I-PER
been I-PER
glorious I-PER
piety I-PER
to I-PER
endure I-PER
; O
but O
an B-PER
amiable I-PER
handsome I-PER
baronet I-PER
, O
who O
said O
" O
Exactly O
" O
to O
her O
remarks O
even O
when O
she O
expressed O
uncertainty O
, O
-- O
how O
could O
he O
affect O
her O
as O
a B-PER
lover I-PER
? O
The O
really O
delightful O
marriage O
must O
be O
that O
where O
your B-PER
husband I-PER
was O
a O
sort O
of O
father B-PER
, O
and O
could O
teach O
you O
even O
Hebrew O
, O
if O
you O
wished O
it O
. O
These O
peculiarities O
of O
Dorothea B-PER
's I-PER
character I-PER
caused O
Mr. B-PER
Brooke O
to O
be O
all O
the O
more O
blamed O
in O
neighboring O
families O
for O
not O
securing O
some B-PER
middle-aged I-PER
lady I-PER
as O
guide O
and O
companion O
to O
his B-PER
nieces I-PER
. O
But O
he O
himself O
dreaded O
so O
much O
the O
sort O
of O
superior B-PER
woman I-PER
likely O
to O
be O
available O
for O
such O
a O
position O
, O
that O
he O
allowed O
himself O
to O
be O
dissuaded O
by O
Dorothea B-PER
's O
objections O
, O
and O
was O
in O
this O
case O
brave O
enough O
to O
defy O
the B-PER
world I-PER
-- O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Cadwallader O
the B-PER
Rector I-PER
's O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
small O
group O
of O
gentry O
with O
whom O
he O
visited O
in O
the B-LOC
northeast I-LOC
corner I-LOC
of I-LOC
Loamshire I-LOC
. O
So O
Miss B-PER
Brooke O
presided O
in O
her B-PER
uncle I-PER
's O
household B-FAC
, O
and O
did O
not O
at O
all O
dislike O
her O
new O
authority O
, O
with O
the O
homage O
that O
belonged O
to O
it O
. O
Sir B-PER
James O
Chettam O
was O
going O
to O
dine O
at O
the O
Grange O
to-day O
with O
another O
gentleman O
whom O
the B-PER
girls I-PER
had O
never O
seen O
, O
and O
about O
whom O
Dorothea B-PER
felt O
some O
venerating O
expectation O
. O
This O
was O
the O
Reverend B-PER
Edward I-PER
Casaubon I-PER
, O
noted O
in O
the B-GPE
county I-GPE
as O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
profound I-PER
learning I-PER
, O
understood O
for O
many O
years O
to O
be O
engaged O
on O
a O
great O
work O
concerning O
religious O
history O
; O
also O
as O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
wealth I-PER
enough I-PER
to I-PER
give I-PER
lustre I-PER
to I-PER
his I-PER
piety I-PER
, O
and O
having O
views O
of O
his O
own O
which O
were O
to O
be O
more O
clearly O
ascertained O
on O
the O
publication O
of O
his O
book O
. O
His O
very O
name O
carried O
an O
impressiveness O
hardly O
to O
be O
measured O
without O
a O
precise O
chronology O
of O
scholarship O
. O
Early O
in O
the O
day O
Dorothea B-PER
had O
returned O
from O
the B-FAC
infant I-FAC
school I-FAC
which O
she O
had O
set O
going O
in O
the B-GPE
village I-GPE
, O
and O
was O
taking O
her O
usual O
place O
in O
the O
pretty O
sitting-room O
which O
divided O
the B-FAC
bedrooms I-FAC
of O
the B-PER
sisters I-PER
, O
bent O
on O
finishing O
a O
plan O
for O
some B-FAC
buildings I-FAC
( O
a O
kind O
of O
work O
which O
she O
delighted O
in O
) O
, O
when O
Celia B-PER

who O
had O
been O
watching O
her O
with O
a O
hesitating O
desire O
to O
propose O
something O
, O

CHAPTER O
I O
I O
TAKE O
A B-FAC
COUNTRY I-FAC
HOUSE I-FAC
This O
is O
the O
story O
of O
how O
a B-PER
middle-aged I-PER
spinster I-PER
lost O
her O
mind O
, O
deserted O
her B-PER
domestic I-PER
gods I-PER
in O
the O
city O
, O
took O
a B-FAC
furnished I-FAC
house I-FAC
for O
the O
summer O
out O
of O
town B-GPE
, O
and O
found O
herself O
involved O
in O
one O
of O
those O
mysterious O
crimes O
that O
keep O
our O
newspapers O
and O
detective O
agencies O
happy O
and O
prosperous O
. O
For O
twenty O
years O
I O
had O
been O
perfectly O
comfortable O
; O
for O
twenty O
years O
I O
had O
had O
the O
window-boxes O
filled O
in O
the O
spring O
, O
the O
carpets O
lifted O
, O
the O
awnings O
put O
up O
and O
the O
furniture O
covered O
with O
brown O
linen O
; O
for O
as O
many O
summers O
I O
had O
said O
good-by O
to O
my B-PER
friends I-PER
, O
and O
, O
after O
watching O
their O
perspiring O
hegira O
, O
had O
settled O
down O
to O
a O
delicious O
quiet O
in O
town B-GPE
, O
where O
the O
mail O
comes O
three O
times O
a O
day O
, O
and O
the O
water O
supply O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
a O
tank O
on O
the O
roof O
. O
And O
then O
-- O
the O
madness O
seized O
me O
. O
When O
I O
look O
back O
over O
the O
months O
I O
spent O
at O
Sunnyside B-GPE
, O
I O
wonder O
that O
I O
survived O
at O
all O
. O
As O
it O
is O
, O
I O
show O
the O
wear O
and O
tear O
of O
my O
harrowing O
experiences O
. O
I O
have O
turned O
very O
gray O
-- O
Liddy B-PER
reminded O
me O
of O
it O
, O
only O
yesterday O
, O
by O
saying O
that O
a O
little O
bluing O
in O
the O
rinse-water O
would O
make O
my O
hair O
silvery O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
yellowish O
white O
. O
I O
hate O
to O
be O
reminded O
of O
unpleasant O
things O
and O
I O
snapped O
her O
off O
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
I O
said O
sharply O
, O
" O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
use O
bluing O
at O
my O
time O
of O
life O
, O
or O
starch O
, O
either O
. O
" O
Liddy B-PER
's O
nerves O
are O
gone O
, O
she O
says O
, O
since O
that O
awful O
summer O
, O
but O
she O
has O
enough O
left O
, O
goodness O
knows O
! O
And O
when O
she O
begins O
to O
go O
around O
with O
a O
lump O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
all O
I O
have O
to O
do O
is O
to O
threaten O
to O
return O
to O
Sunnyside B-GPE
, O
and O
she O
is O
frightened O
into O
a O
semblance O
of O
cheerfulness O
, O
-- O
from O
which O
you O
may O
judge O
that O
the O
summer O
there O
was O
anything O
but O
a O
success O
. O
The O
newspaper O
accounts O
have O
been O
so O
garbled O
and O
incomplete O
-- O
one O
of O
them O
mentioned O
me O
but O
once O
, O
and O
then O
only O
as O
the B-PER
tenant I-PER
at O
the O
time O
the O
thing O
happened O
-- O
that O
I O
feel O
it O
my O
due O
to O
tell O
what O
I O
know O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Jamieson O
, O
the B-PER
detective I-PER
, O
said O
himself O
he O
could O
never O
have O
done O
without O
me O
, O
although O
he O
gave O
me O
little O
enough O
credit O
, O
in O
print O
. O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
go O
back O
several O
years O
-- O
thirteen O
, O
to O
be O
exact O
-- O
to O
start O
my O
story O
. O
At O
that O
time O
my B-PER
brother I-PER
died O
, O
leaving O
me O
his B-PER
two I-PER
children I-PER
. O
Halsey B-PER
was O
eleven O
then O
, O
and O
Gertrude B-PER
was O
seven O
. O
All O
the O
responsibilities O
of O
maternity O
were O
thrust O
upon O
me O
suddenly O
; O
to O
perfect O
the O
profession O
of O
motherhood O
requires O
precisely O
as O
many O
years O
as O
the B-PER
child I-PER
has O
lived O
, O
like O
the B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
started I-PER
to I-PER
carry I-PER
the I-PER
calf I-PER
and I-PER
ended I-PER
by I-PER
walking I-PER
along I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
bull I-PER
on I-PER
his I-PER
shoulders I-PER
. O
However O
, O
I O
did O
the O
best O
I O
could O
. O
When O
Gertrude B-PER
got O
past O
the O
hair-ribbon O
age O
, O
and O
Halsey B-PER
asked O
for O
a O
scarf-pin O
and O
put O
on O
long O
trousers O
-- O
and O
a O
wonderful O
help O
that O
was O
to O
the O
darning O
. O
-- O
I O
sent O
them O
away O
to O
good B-FAC
schools I-FAC
. O
After O
that O
, O
my O
responsibility O
was O
chiefly O
postal O
, O
with O
three O
months O
every O
summer O
in O
which O
to O
replenish O
their O
wardrobes O
, O
look O
over O
their O
lists O
of O
acquaintances O
, O
and O
generally O
to O
take O
my O
foster-motherhood O
out O
of O
its O
nine O
months O
' O
retirement O
in O
camphor O
. O
I O
missed O
the O
summers O
with O
them O
when O
, O
somewhat O
later O
, O
at O
boarding-school B-FAC
and O
college B-FAC
, O
the B-PER
children I-PER
spent O
much O
of O
their O
vacations O
with O
friends B-PER
. O
Gradually O
I O
found O
that O
my O
name O
signed O
to O
a O
check O
was O
even O
more O
welcome O
than O
when O
signed O
to O
a O
letter O
, O
though O
I O
wrote O
them O
at O
stated O
intervals O
. O
But O
when O
Halsey B-PER
had O
finished O
his O
electrical O
course O
and O
Gertrude B-PER
her B-FAC
boarding-school I-FAC
, O
and O
both O
came O
home B-FAC
to O
stay O
, O
things O
were O
suddenly O
changed O
. O
The O
winter O
Gertrude B-PER
came O
out O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
succession O
of O
sitting O
up O
late O
at O
night O
to O
bring O
her B-FAC
home I-FAC
from O
things O
, O
taking O
her O
to O
the B-PER
dressmakers I-PER
between O
naps O
the O
next O
day O
, O
and O
discouraging O
ineligible B-PER
youths I-PER
with I-PER
either I-PER
more I-PER
money I-PER
than I-PER
brains I-PER
, I-PER
or I-PER
more I-PER
brains I-PER
than I-PER
money I-PER
. O
Also O
, O
I O
acquired O
a O
great O
many O
things O
: O
to O
say O
lingerie O
for O
under-garments O
, O
" O
frocks O
" O
and O
" O
gowns O
" O
instead O
of O
dresses O
, O
and O
that O
beardless B-PER
sophomores I-PER
are O
not O
college B-PER
boys I-PER
, O
but O
college B-PER
men I-PER
. O
Halsey B-PER
required O
less O
personal O
supervision O
, O
and O
as O
they O
both O
got O
their B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
fortune O
that O
winter O
, O
my O
responsibility O
became O
purely O
moral O
. O
Halsey B-PER
bought O
a B-VEH
car I-VEH
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
I O
learned O
how O
to O
tie O
over O
my O
bonnet O
a O
gray O
baize O
veil O
, O
and O
, O
after O
a O
time O
, O
never O
to O
stop O
to O
look O
at O
the O
dogs O
one O
has O
run O
down O
. O
People B-PER
are O
apt O
to O
be O
so O
unpleasant O
about O
their O
dogs O
. O
The O
additions O
to O
my O
education O
made O
me O
a B-PER
properly I-PER
equipped I-PER
maiden I-PER
aunt I-PER
, O
and O
by O
spring O
I O
was O
quite O
tractable O
. O
So O
when O
Halsey B-PER
suggested O
camping O
in O
the O
Adirondacks B-LOC
and O
Gertrude B-PER
wanted O
Bar B-GPE
Harbor I-GPE
, O
we O
compromised O
on O
a B-FAC
good I-FAC
country I-FAC
house I-FAC
with O
links O
near O
, O
within O
motor O
distance O
of O
town B-GPE
and O
telephone O
distance O
of O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
. O
That O
was O
how O
we O
went O
to O
Sunnyside B-GPE
. O
We O
went O
out O
to O
inspect O
the B-FAC
property I-FAC
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
deserve O
its O
name O
. O
Its O
cheerful O
appearance O
gave O
no O
indication O
whatever O
of O
anything O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O
Only O
one O
thing O
seemed O
unusual O
to O
me O
: O
the B-PER
housekeeper I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
been I-PER
left I-PER
in I-PER
charge I-PER
, O
had O
moved O
from O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
to O
the B-PER
gardener I-PER
's O
lodge O
, O
a O
few O
days O
before O
. O
As O
the B-FAC
lodge I-FAC
was O
far O
enough O
away O
from O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
either O
fire O
or O
thieves B-PER
could O
complete O
their O
work O
of O
destruction O
undisturbed O
. O
The B-FAC
property I-FAC
was O
an O
extensive O
one O
: O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
on O
the O
top O
of O
a B-LOC
hill I-LOC
, O
which O
sloped O
away O
in O
great O
stretches O
of O
green B-FAC
lawn I-FAC
and O
clipped O
hedges O
, O
to O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
; O
and O
across O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
, O
perhaps O
a O
couple O
of O
miles O
away O
, O
was O
the B-FAC
Greenwood I-FAC
Club I-FAC
House I-FAC
. O
Gertrude B-PER
and O
Halsey B-PER
were O
infatuated O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
it O
's O
everything O
you O
want O
, O
" O
Halsey B-PER
said O
" O
View O
, O
air O
, O
good O
water O
and O
good B-FAC
roads I-FAC
. O
As O
for O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
it O
's O
big O
enough O
for O
a B-FAC
hospital I-FAC
, O
if O
it O
has O
a O
Queen O
Anne O
front O
and O
a O
Mary O
Anne O
back O
, O
" O
which O
was O
ridiculous O
: O
it O
was O
pure O
Elizabethan O
. O
Of O
course O
we O
took O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
; O
it O
was O
not O
my O
idea O
of O
comfort O
, O
being O
much O
too O
large O
and O
sufficiently O
isolated O
to O
make O
the B-PER
servant I-PER
question O
serious O
. O
But O
I O
give O
myself O
credit O
for O
this O
: O
whatever O
has O
happened O
since O
, O
I O
never O
blamed O
Halsey B-PER
and O
Gertrude B-PER
for O
taking O
me O
there B-FAC
. O
And O
another O
thing O
: O
if O
the O
series O
of O
catastrophes O
there B-FAC
did O
nothing O
else O
, O
it O
taught O
me O
one O
thing O
-- O
that O
somehow O
, O
somewhere O
, O
from O
perhaps O
a B-PER
half-civilized I-PER
ancestor I-PER
who I-PER
wore I-PER
a I-PER
sheepskin I-PER
garment I-PER
and I-PER
trailed I-PER
his I-PER
food I-PER
or I-PER
his I-PER
prey I-PER
, O
I O
have O
in O
me O
the O
instinct O
of O
the O
chase O
. O
Were O
I O
a B-PER
man I-PER
I O
should O
be O
a O
trapper O
of O
criminals B-PER
, O
trailing O
them O
as O
relentlessly O
as O
no O
doubt O
my B-PER
sheepskin I-PER
ancestor I-PER
did O
his O
wild O
boar O
. O
But O
being O
an B-PER
unmarried I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
with O
the O
handicap O
of O
my O
sex O
, O
my O
first O
acquaintance O
with O
crime O
will O
probably O
be O
my O
last O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
came O
near O
enough O
to O
being O
my O
last O
acquaintance O
with O
anything O
. O
The O
property O
was O
owned O
by O
Paul B-PER
Armstrong I-PER
, O
the O
president O
of O
the B-ORG
Traders I-ORG
' I-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
who O
at O
the O
time O
we O
took O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
was O
in O
the O
west O
with O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
daughter B-PER
, O
and O
a O
Doctor O
Walker O
, O
the O
Armstrong B-PER
family O
physician O
. O
Halsey B-PER
knew O
Louise B-PER
Armstrong I-PER
, O
-- O
had O
been O
rather O
attentive O
to O
her O
the O
winter O
before O
, O
but O
as O
Halsey B-PER
was O
always O
attentive O
to O
somebody B-PER
, O
I O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
it O
seriously O
, O
although O
she O
was O
a B-PER
charming I-PER
girl I-PER
. O
I O
knew O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Armstrong O
only O
through O
his O
connection O
with O
the B-ORG
bank I-ORG
, I-ORG
where I-ORG
the I-ORG
children I-ORG
's I-ORG
money I-ORG
was I-ORG
largely I-ORG
invested I-ORG
, O
and O
through O
an O
ugly O
story O
about O
the B-PER
son I-PER
, O
Arnold B-PER
Armstrong I-PER
, O
who O
was O
reported O
to O
have O
forged O
his B-PER
father I-PER
's O
name O
, O
for O
a O
considerable O
amount O
, O
to O
some O
bank O
paper O
. O
However O
, O
the O
story O
had O
had O
no O
interest O
for O
me O
. O
I O
cleared O
Halsey B-PER
and O
Gertrude B-PER
away O
to O
a O
house B-FAC
party O
, O
and O
moved O
out O
to O
Sunnyside B-GPE
the O
first O
of O
May O
. O
The B-FAC
roads I-FAC
were O
bad O
, O
but O
the O
trees O
were O
in O
leaf O
, O
and O
there O
were O
still O
tulips O
in O
the O
borders O
around O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
The O
arbutus O
was O
fragrant O
in O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
under O
the O
dead O
leaves O
, O
and O
on O
the O
way O
from O
the B-FAC
station I-FAC
, O
a O
short O
mile O
, O
while O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
stuck O
in O
the O
mud O
, O
I O
found O
a B-LOC
bank I-LOC
showered I-LOC
with I-LOC
tiny I-LOC
forget-me-nots I-LOC
. O
The O
birds O
-- O
do O
n't O
ask O
me O
what O
kind O
; O
they O
all O
look O
alike O
to O
me O
, O
unless O
they O
have O
a O
hall O
mark O
of O
some O
bright O
color O
-- O
the O
birds O
were O
chirping O
in O
the O
hedges O
, O
and O
everything O
breathed O
of O
peace O
. O
Liddy B-PER

The O

quietly O

I O
have O
always O
been O
grateful O
for O
that O
one O
night O

peace O

it O

what O
the B-LOC

might O
be O

favorable O

Never O
after O
that O
night O
did O
I O
put O
my O
head O
on O
my O
pillow O
with O
any O
assurance O
how O
long O
it O
would O
be O
there O

or O
on O

for O
that O

On O
the O
following O
morning O
Liddy B-PER
and O
Mrs. B-PER
Ralston O
, O
my B-PER
own I-PER
housekeeper I-PER
, O
had O
a O
difference O
of O
opinion O
, O
and O
Mrs. B-PER
Ralston O
left O
on O
the B-VEH
eleven I-VEH
train I-VEH
. O
Just O
after O
luncheon O
, O
Burke B-PER
, O
the B-PER
butler I-PER
, O
was O
taken O
unexpectedly O
with O
a O
pain O
in O
his O
right O
side O

much O
worse O
when O
I O
was O
within O

and O
by O
afternoon O
he O
was O
started O
cityward O
. O
That O
night O
the B-PER
cook I-PER

sister O
had O
a B-PER
baby I-PER
-- O
the B-PER
cook I-PER
, O
seeing O
indecision O
in O
my O
face O
, O
made O
it O

on O
second O
thought O

and O
, O
to O
be O
short O
, O
by O
noon O
the O
next O
day O
the B-PER
household I-PER
staff I-PER
was O
down O
to O
Liddy B-PER

myself O

And O
this O
in O
a B-FAC
house I-FAC
with O
twenty-two B-FAC

five B-FAC

! O
Liddy B-PER
wanted O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the B-GPE
city I-GPE
at O
once O
, O
but O
the B-PER
milk-boy I-PER
said O
that O
Thomas B-PER

working O
as O
a O

at O
the B-FAC
Greenwood I-FAC

might O
come O
back O

I O
have O
the O
usual O
scruples O
about O
coercing O
people B-PER

arrived O
at O
6:46 O

but O
train B-VEH
was O
an O
hour O
late O
. O
Buda-Pesth B-GPE
seems O
a B-GPE
wonderful I-GPE
place I-GPE
, O
from O
the O
glimpse O
which O
I O
got O
of O
it O
from O
the B-VEH
train I-VEH
and O
the O
little O
I O
could O
walk O
through O
the B-FAC
streets I-FAC
. O
I O
feared O
to O
go O
very O
far O
from O
the B-FAC
station I-FAC
, O
as O
we O
had O
arrived O
late O
and O
would O
start O
as O
near O
the O
correct O
time O
as O
possible O
. O
The O
impression O
I O
had O
was O
that O
we O
were O
leaving O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
and O
entering O
the B-LOC
East I-LOC
; O
the O
most O
western O
of O
splendid O
bridges O
over O
the B-LOC
Danube I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
here O
of O
noble O
width O
and O
depth O
, O
took O
us O
among O
the O
traditions O
of O
Turkish O
rule O
. O
We O
left O
in O
pretty O
good O
time O
, O
and O
came O
after O
nightfall O
to O
Klausenburgh B-GPE
. O
Here B-FAC
I O
stopped O
for O
the O
night O
at O
the B-FAC
Hotel I-FAC
Royale I-FAC
. O
I O
had O
for O
dinner O
, O
or O
rather O
supper O
, O
a O
chicken O
done O
up O
some O
way O
with O
red O
pepper O
, O
which O
was O
very O
good O
but O
thirsty O
. O
( O
_ O
Mem O

I O
asked O
the B-PER
waiter I-PER
, O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
called O
" O
paprika O
hendl O
, O
" O
and O
that O
, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
national O
dish O
, O
I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
it O
anywhere O
along O
the B-LOC
Carpathians I-LOC
. O
I O
found O
my O
smattering O
of O
German O
very O
useful O
here O
; O
indeed O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
on O
without O
it O
. O
Having O
had O
some O
time O
at O
my O
disposal O
when O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
I O
had O
visited O
the B-FAC
British I-FAC
Museum I-FAC
, O
and O
made O
search O
among O
the O
books O
and O
maps O
in O
the B-FAC
library I-FAC
regarding O
Transylvania B-GPE
; O
it O
had O
struck O
me O
that O
some O
foreknowledge O
of O
the B-GPE
country I-GPE
could O
hardly O
fail O
to O
have O
some O
importance O
in O
dealing O
with O
a O
nobleman O
of O
that B-GPE
country I-GPE
. O
I O
find O
that O
the B-GPE
district I-GPE
he I-GPE
named I-GPE
is O
in O
the O
extreme O
east O
of O
the B-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
just O
on O
the O
borders O
of O
three B-GPE
states I-GPE
, O
Transylvania B-GPE
, O
Moldavia B-GPE
and O
Bukovina B-GPE
, O
in O
the B-LOC
midst I-LOC
of I-LOC
the I-LOC
Carpathian I-LOC
mountains I-LOC
; O
one O
of O
the O
wildest O
and O
least O
known O
portions O
of O
Europe B-GPE
. O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
light O
on O
any O
map O
or O
work O
giving O
the O
exact O
locality O
of O
the B-FAC
Castle I-FAC
Dracula I-FAC
, O
as O
there O
are O
no O
maps O
of O
this B-GPE
country I-GPE
as O
yet O
to O
compare O
with O
our O
own O
Ordnance O
Survey O
maps O
; O
but O
I O
found O
that O
Bistritz B-GPE
, O
the O
post O
town O
named O
by O
Count B-PER
Dracula O
, O
is O
a B-GPE
fairly I-GPE
well-known I-GPE
place I-GPE
. O
I O
shall O
enter O
here O
some O
of O
my O
notes O
, O
as O
they O
may O
refresh O
my O
memory O
when O
I O
talk O
over O
my O
travels O
with O
Mina B-PER
. O
In O
the O
population O
of O
Transylvania B-GPE
there O
are O
four O
distinct O
nationalities O
: O
Saxons O
in O
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
, O
and O
mixed O
with O
them O
the B-PER
Wallachs I-PER
, O
who O
are O
the O
descendants O
of O
the B-PER
Dacians I-PER
; O
Magyars B-PER
in O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
, O
and O
Szekelys B-PER
in O
the B-LOC
East I-LOC
and O
North B-LOC
. O
I O
am O
going O
among O
the B-PER
latter I-PER
, O
who O
claim O
to O
be O
descended O
from O
Attila B-PER
and O
the O
Huns B-PER
. O
This O
may O
be O
so O
, O
for O
when O
the B-PER
Magyars I-PER
conquered O
the B-GPE
country I-GPE
in O
the O
eleventh O
century O
they O
found O
the B-PER
Huns I-PER
settled O
in O
it O
. O
I O
read O
that O
every O
known O
superstition O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
is O
gathered O
into O
the O
horseshoe O
of O
the B-LOC
Carpathians I-LOC
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the B-LOC
centre I-LOC
of I-LOC
some I-LOC
sort I-LOC
of I-LOC
imaginative I-LOC
whirlpool I-LOC
; O
if O
so O
my O
stay O
may O
be O
very O
interesting O
. O
( O
_ O
Mem O
. O
_ O
, O
I O
must O
ask O
the B-PER
Count I-PER
all O
about O
them O
. O
) O
I O
did O
not O
sleep O
well O
, O
though O
my O
bed O
was O
comfortable O
enough O
, O
for O
I O
had O
all O
sorts O
of O
queer O
dreams O
. O
There O
was O
a O
dog O
howling O
all O
night O
under O
my O
window O
, O
which O
may O
have O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
it O
; O
or O
it O
may O
have O
been O
the O
paprika O
, O
for O
I O
had O
to O
drink O
up O
all O
the O
water O
in O
my O
carafe O
, O
and O
was O
still O
thirsty O
. O
Towards O
morning O
I O
slept O
and O
was O
wakened O
by O
the O
continuous O
knocking O
at O
my O
door O
, O
so O
I O
guess O
I O
must O
have O
been O
sleeping O
soundly O
then O
. O
I O
had O
for O
breakfast O
more O
paprika O
, O
and O
a O
sort O
of O
porridge O
of O
maize O
flour O
which O
they O
said O
was O
" O
mamaliga O
, O
" O
and O
egg-plant O
stuffed O
with O
forcemeat O
, O
a O
very O
excellent O
dish O
, O
which O
they O
call O
" O
impletata O
. O
" O
( O
_ O
Mem O
. O
_ O
, O
get O
recipe O
for O
this O
also O
. O
) O
I O
had O
to O
hurry O
breakfast O
, O
for O
the B-VEH
train I-VEH
started O
a O
little O
before O
eight O
, O
or O
rather O
it O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
so O
, O
for O
after O
rushing O
to O
the B-FAC
station I-FAC
at O
7:30 O
I O
had O
to O
sit O
in O
the B-VEH
carriage I-VEH
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
before O
we O
began O
to O
move O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
further O
east O
you O
go O
the O
more O
unpunctual O
are O
the B-VEH
trains I-VEH
. O
What O
ought O
they O
to O
be O
in O
China B-GPE
? O
All O
day O
long O
we O
seemed O
to O
dawdle O
through O
a B-GPE
country I-GPE
which I-GPE
was I-GPE
full I-GPE
of I-GPE
beauty I-GPE
of I-GPE
every I-GPE
kind I-GPE
. O
Sometimes O
we O
saw O
little B-GPE
towns I-GPE
or O
castles O
on O
the B-LOC
top I-LOC
of I-LOC
steep I-LOC
hills I-LOC
such O
as O
we O
see O
in O
old O
missals O
; O
sometimes O
we O
ran O
by O
rivers B-LOC
and I-LOC
streams I-LOC
which O
seemed O
from O
the O
wide O
stony O
margin O
on O
each O
side O
of O
them O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
great O
floods O
. O
It O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
, O
and O
running O
strong O
, O
to O
sweep O
the O
outside O
edge O
of O
a O
river O
clear O
. O
At O
every B-FAC
station I-FAC
there O
were O
groups B-PER
of I-PER
people I-PER
, O
sometimes O
crowds B-PER
, O
and O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
attire O
. O
Some O
of O
them O
were O
just O
like O
the O
peasants O
at O
home B-GPE
or O
those O
I O
saw O
coming O
through O
France B-GPE
and O
Germany B-GPE
, O
with O
short O
jackets O
and O
round O
hats O
and O
home-made O
trousers O
; O
but O
others O
were O
very O
picturesque O
. O
The B-PER
women I-PER
looked O
pretty O
, O
except O
when O
you O
got O
near O
them O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
clumsy O
about O
the O
waist O
. O
They O
had O
all O
full O
white O
sleeves O
of O
some O
kind O
or O
other O
, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
had O
big O
belts O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
strips O
of O
something O
fluttering O
from O
them O
like O
the O
dresses O
in O
a O
ballet O
, O
but O
of O
course O
there O
were O
petticoats O
under O
them O
. O
The O
strangest O
figures O
we O
saw O
were O
the B-PER
Slovaks I-PER
, O
who O
were O
more O
barbarian O
than O
the O
rest O
, O
with O
their O
big O
cow-boy O
hats O
, O
great O
baggy O
dirty-white O
trousers O
, O
white O
linen O
shirts O
, O
and O
enormous O
heavy O
leather O
belts O
, O
nearly O
a O
foot O
wide O
, O
all O
studded O
over O
with O
brass O
nails O
. O
They O
wore O
high O
boots O
, O
with O
their O
trousers O
tucked O
into O
them O
, O
and O
had O
long O
black O
hair O
and O
heavy O
black O
moustaches O
. O
They O
are O
very O
picturesque O
, O
but O
do O
not O
look O
prepossessing O
. O
On O
the O
stage O
they O
would O
be O
set O
down O
at O
once O
as O
some O
old O
Oriental O
band O
of O
brigands B-PER
. O
They O
are O
, O
however O
, O
I O
am O
told O
, O
very O
harmless O
and O
rather O
wanting O
in O
natural O
self-assertion O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
dark O
side O
of O
twilight O
when O
we O
got O
to O
Bistritz B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
a B-GPE
very I-GPE
interesting I-GPE
old I-GPE
place I-GPE
. O
Being O
practically O
on O
the B-LOC
frontier I-LOC
-- O
for O
the B-LOC
Borgo I-LOC
Pass I-LOC
leads O
from O
it O
into O
Bukovina B-GPE
-- O
it O
has O
had O
a O
very O
stormy O
existence O
, O
and O
it O
certainly O
shows O
marks O
of O
it O
. O
Fifty O
years O
ago O
a O
series O
of O
great O
fires O
took O
place O
, O
which O
made O
terrible O
havoc O
on O
five O
separate O
occasions O
. O
At O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
seventeenth O
century O
it O
underwent O
a O
siege O
of O
three O
weeks O
and O
lost O
13,000 B-PER
people I-PER
, O
the O
casualties O
of O
war O
proper O
being O
assisted O
by O
famine O
and O
disease O
. O
Count B-PER
Dracula O
had O
directed O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the B-FAC
Golden I-FAC
Krone I-FAC
Hotel I-FAC
, O
which O
I O
found O
, O
to O
my O
great O
delight O
, O
to O
be O
thoroughly O
old-fashioned O
, O
for O
of O
course O
I O
wanted O
to O
see O
all O
I O
could O
of O
the O
ways O
of O
the B-GPE
country I-GPE
. O
I O
was O
evidently O
expected O
, O
for O
when O
I O
got O
near O
the O
door O
I O
faced O
a B-PER
cheery-looking I-PER
elderly I-PER
woman I-PER
in O
the O
usual O
peasant O
dress O
-- O
white O
undergarment O
with O
long O
double O
apron O
, O
front O
, O
and O
back O
, O
of O
coloured O
stuff O
fitting O
almost O
too O
tight O
for O
modesty O
. O
When O
I O
came O
close O
she O
bowed O
and O
said O
, O
" O
The B-PER
Herr I-PER
Englishman I-PER
? O
" O
" O
Yes O

said O

-- O
I O
found O
that O
my B-PER
landlord I-PER
had O
got O
a O
letter O
from O
the B-LOC
Count I-LOC
, O
directing O
him O
to O
secure O
the O
best O
place O
on O
the B-VEH
coach I-VEH
for O
me O
; O
but O
on O
making O
inquiries O
as O
to O
details O
he O
seemed O
somewhat O
reticent O
, O
and O
pretended O
that O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
my O
German O
. O
This O
could O
not O
be O
true O
, O
because O
up O
to O
then O
he O
had O
understood O
it O
perfectly O
; O
at O
least O
, O
he O
answered O
my O
questions O
exactly O
as O
if O
he O
did O
. O
He O
and O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
the B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
received I-PER
me I-PER
, O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
in O
a O
frightened O
sort O
of O
way O
. O
He O
mumbled O
out O
that O
the O
money O
had O
been O
sent O
in O
a O
letter O
, O
and O
that O
was O
all O
he O
knew O
. O
When O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
knew O
Count B-PER
Dracula O
, O
and O
could O
tell O
me O
anything O
of O
his B-FAC
castle I-FAC
, O
both O
he O
and O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
crossed O
themselves O
, O
and O
, O
saying O
that O
they O
knew O
nothing O
at O
all O
, O
simply O
refused O
to O
speak O
further O
. O
It O
was O
so O
near O
the O
time O
of O
starting O
that O
I O
had O
no O
time O
to O
ask O
any B-PER
one I-PER
else I-PER
, O
for O
it O
was O
all O
very O
mysterious O
and O
not O
by O
any O
means O
comforting O
. O
Just O
before O
I O
was O
leaving O
, O
the B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
came O
up O
to O
my B-FAC
room I-FAC
and O
said O
in O
a O
very O
hysterical O
way O
: O
" O
Must O
you O
go O
? O
Oh O
! O
young B-PER
Herr I-PER
, O
must O
you O
go O
? O
" O
She O
was O
in O
such O
an O
excited O
state O
that O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
lost O
her O
grip O
of O
what O
German O
she O
knew O
, O
and O
mixed O
it O
all O
up O
with O
some O
other O
language O
which O
I O
did O
not O
know O
at O
all O
. O
I O
was O
just O
able O
to O
follow O
her O
by O
asking O
many O
questions O
. O
When O
I O
told O
her O
that O
I O
must O
go O
at O
once O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
engaged O
on O
important O
business O
, O
she O
asked O
again O
: O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
what O
day O
it O
is O
? O
" O
I O
answered O
that O
it O
was O
the O
fourth O
of O
May O
. O
She O
shook O
her O
head O
as O
she O
said O
again O
: O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
I O
know O
that O
! O
I O
know O
that O
, O
but O
do O
you O
know O
what O
day O
it O
is O
? O
" O
On O
my O
saying O
that O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
, O
she O
went O
on O
: O
" O
It O
is O
the O
eve O
of O
St. B-PER
George O
's O
Day O
. O
Do O
you O
not O
know O
that O
to-night O
, O
when O
the O
clock O
strikes O
midnight O
, O
all O
the O
evil O
things O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
will O
have O
full O
sway O
? O
Do O
you O
know O
where O
you O
are O
going O
, O
and O
what O
you O
are O
going O
to O
? O
" O
She O
was O
in O
such O
evident O
distress O
that O
I O
tried O
to O
comfort O
her O
, O
but O
without O
effect O
. O
Finally O
she O
went O
down O
on O
her O
knees O
and O
implored O
me O
not O
to O
go O
; O
at O
least O
to O
wait O
a O
day O
or O
two O
before O
starting O
. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
ridiculous O
but O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
. O
However O
, O
there O
was O
business O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
I O
could O
allow O
nothing O
to O
interfere O
with O
it O
. O
I O
therefore O
tried O
to O
raise O
her O
up O
, O
and O
said O
, O
as O
gravely O
as O
I O
could O
, O
that O
I O
thanked O
her O
, O
but O
my O
duty O
was O
imperative O
, O
and O
that O
I O
must O
go O
. O
She O
then O
rose O
and O
dried O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
taking O
a O
crucifix O
from O
her O
neck O
offered O
it O
to O
me O
. O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
, O
for O
, O
as O
an B-PER
English I-PER
Churchman I-PER
, O
I O
have O
been O
taught O
to O
regard O
such O
things O
as O
in O
some O
measure O
idolatrous O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
seemed O
so O
ungracious O
to O
refuse O
an B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
meaning I-PER
so I-PER
well I-PER
and I-PER
in I-PER
such I-PER
a I-PER
state I-PER
of I-PER
mind I-PER
. O
She O
saw O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
the O
doubt O
in O
my O
face O
, O
for O
she O
put O
the O
rosary O
round O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
For O
your B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
sake O
, O
" O
and O
went O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
I O
am O
writing O
up O
this O
part O
of O
the O
diary O
whilst O
I O
am O
waiting O
for O
the B-VEH
coach I-VEH
, O
which O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
late O
; O
and O
the O
crucifix O
is O
still O
round O
my O
neck O
. O
Whether O
it O
is O
the B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
's O
fear O
, O
or O
the O
many O
ghostly O
traditions O
of O
this B-GPE
place I-GPE
, O
or O
the O
crucifix O
itself O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
feeling O
nearly O
as O
easy O
in O
my O
mind O
as O
usual O
. O
If O
this O
book O
should O
ever O
reach O
Mina B-PER
before O
I O
do O
, O
let O
it O
bring O
my O
good-bye O
. O
Here O
comes O
the B-VEH

01 O
My O
Early O
Home O
The B-LOC
first I-LOC
place I-LOC
that I-LOC
I I-LOC
can I-LOC
well I-LOC
remember I-LOC
was O
a O
large O
pleasant O
meadow O
with O
a B-LOC
pond I-LOC
of I-LOC
clear I-LOC
water I-LOC
in I-LOC
it I-LOC
. O
Some O
shady O
trees O
leaned O
over O
it O
, O
and O
rushes O
and O
water-lilies O
grew O
at O
the O
deep O
end O
. O
Over O
the O
hedge O
on O
one O
side O
we O
looked O
into O
a B-FAC
plowed I-FAC
field I-FAC
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
we O
looked O
over O
a O
gate O
at O
our B-FAC
master I-FAC
’s I-FAC
house I-FAC
, I-FAC
which I-FAC
stood I-FAC
by I-FAC
the I-FAC
roadside I-FAC
; O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the B-LOC
meadow I-LOC
was O
a B-LOC
grove I-LOC
of I-LOC
fir I-LOC
trees I-LOC
, O
and O
at O
the O
bottom O
a B-LOC
running I-LOC
brook I-LOC
overhung I-LOC
by I-LOC
a I-LOC
steep I-LOC
bank I-LOC
. O
While O
I O
was O
young O
I O
lived O
upon O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
’s O
milk O
, O
as O
I O
could O
not O
eat O
grass O
. O
In O
the O
daytime O
I O
ran O
by O
her O
side O
, O
and O
at O
night O
I O
lay O
down O
close O
by O
her O
. O
When O
it O
was O
hot O
we O
used O
to O
stand O
by O
the B-LOC
pond I-LOC
in O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
when O
it O
was O
cold O
we O
had O
a O
nice O
warm O
shed O
near O
the B-LOC
grove I-LOC
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
old O
enough O
to O
eat O
grass O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
used O
to O
go O
out O
to O
work O
in O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
come O
back O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
There O
were O
six B-PER
young I-PER
colts I-PER
in O
the B-LOC
meadow I-LOC
besides O
me O
; O
they O
were O
older O
than O
I O
was O
; O
some O
were O
nearly O
as O
large O
as O
grown-up O
horses O
. O
I O
used O
to O
run O
with O
them O
, O
and O
had O
great O
fun O
; O
we O
used O
to O
gallop O
all O
together O
round O
and O
round O
the B-LOC
field I-LOC
as O
hard O
as O
we O
could O
go O
. O
Sometimes O
we O
had O
rather O
rough O
play O
, O
for O
they O
would O
frequently O
bite O
and O
kick O
as O
well O
as O
gallop O
. O
One O
day O
, O
when O
there O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
kicking O
, O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
whinnied O
to O
me O
to O
come O
to O
her O
, O
and O
then O
she O
said O
: O
“ O
I O
wish O
you O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
what O
I O
am O
going O
to O
say O
to O
you O
. O
The B-PER
colts I-PER
who I-PER
live I-PER
here I-PER
are O
very B-PER
good I-PER
colts I-PER
, O
but O
they O
are O
cart-horse B-PER
colts I-PER
, O
and O
of O
course O
they O
have O
not O
learned O
manners O
. O
You O
have O
been O
well-bred O
and O
well-born O
; O
your B-PER
father I-PER
has O
a O
great O
name O
in O
these O
parts O
, O
and O
your B-PER
grandfather I-PER
won O
the O
cup O
two O
years O
at O
the O
Newmarket B-GPE
races O
; O
your B-PER
grandmother I-PER
had O
the O
sweetest O
temper O
of O
any B-PER
horse I-PER
I I-PER
ever I-PER
knew I-PER
, O
and O
I O
think O
you O
have O
never O
seen O
me O
kick O
or O
bite O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
grow O
up O
gentle O
and O
good O
, O
and O
never O
learn O
bad O
ways O
; O
do O
your O
work O
with O
a O
good O
will O
, O
lift O
your O
feet O
up O
well O
when O
you O
trot O
, O
and O
never O
bite O
or O
kick O
even O
in O
play O
. O
” O
I O
have O
never O
forgotten O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
’s O
advice O
; O
I O
knew O
she O
was O
a B-PER
wise I-PER
old I-PER
horse I-PER
, O
and O
our B-PER
master I-PER
thought O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
her O
. O
Her O
name O
was O
Duchess B-PER
, O
but O
he O
often O
called O
her O
Pet B-PER
. O
Our B-PER
master I-PER
was O
a B-PER
good I-PER
, I-PER
kind I-PER
man I-PER
. O
He O
gave O
us O
good O
food O
, O
good O
lodging O
, O
and O
kind O
words O
; O
he O
spoke O
as O
kindly O
to O
us O
as O
he O
did O
to O
his B-PER
little I-PER
children I-PER
. O
We O
were O
all O
fond O
of O
him O
, O
and O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
loved O
him O
very O
much O
. O
When O
she O
saw O
him O
at O
the O
gate O
she O
would O
neigh O
with O
joy O
, O
and O
trot O
up O
to O
him O
. O
He O
would O
pat O
and O
stroke O
her O
and O
say O
, O
“ O
Well O
, O
old B-PER
Pet I-PER
, O
and O
how O
is O
your B-PER
little I-PER
Darkie I-PER
? O
” O
I O
was O
a O
dull O
black O
, O
so O
he O
called O
me O
Darkie B-PER
; O
then O
he O
would O
give O
me O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
, O
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
sometimes O
he O
brought O
a O
carrot O
for O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
All B-PER
the I-PER
horses I-PER
would O
come O
to O
him O
, O
but O
I O
think O
we O
were O
his B-PER
favorites I-PER
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
always O
took O
him O
to O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
on O
a O
market O
day O
in O
a O
light O
gig O
. O
There O
was O
a B-PER
plowboy I-PER
, O
Dick B-PER
, O
who O
sometimes O
came O
into O
our O
field O
to O
pluck O
blackberries O
from O
the O
hedge O
. O
When O
he O
had O
eaten O
all O
he O
wanted O
he O
would O
have O
what O
he O
called O
fun O
with O
the B-PER
colts I-PER
, O
throwing O
stones O
and O
sticks O
at O
them O
to O
make O
them O
gallop O
. O
We O
did O
not O
much O
mind O
him O
, O
for O
we O
could O
gallop O
off O
; O
but O
sometimes O
a O
stone O
would O
hit O
and O
hurt O
us O
. O
One O
day O
he O
was O
at O
this O
game O
, O
and O
did O
not O
know O
that O
the B-PER
master I-PER
was O
in O
the B-LOC
next I-LOC
field I-LOC
; O
but O
he O
was O
there B-LOC
, O
watching O
what O
was O
going O
on O
; O
over O
the O
hedge O
he O
jumped O
in O
a O
snap O
, O
and O
catching O
Dick B-PER
by O
the O
arm O
, O
he O
gave O
him O
such O
a O
box O
on O
the O
ear O
as O
made O
him O
roar O
with O
the O
pain O
and O
surprise O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
we O
saw O
the B-PER
master I-PER
we O
trotted O
up O
nearer O
to O
see O
what O
went O
on O
. O
“ O
Bad B-PER
boy I-PER
! O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
bad B-PER
boy I-PER
! O
to O
chase O
the B-PER
colts I-PER
. O
This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
, O
nor O
the O
second O
, O
but O
it O
shall O
be O
the O
last O
. O
There O
-- O
take O
your O
money O
and O
go O
home B-FAC
; O
I O
shall O
not O
want O
you O
on O
my B-FAC
farm I-FAC
again O
. O
” O
So O
we O
never O
saw O
Dick B-PER
any O
more O
. O
Old B-PER
Daniel I-PER
, O
the O
man O
who O
looked O
after O
the B-PER
horses I-PER
, O
was O
just O
as O
gentle O
as O
our B-PER
master I-PER
, O
so O
we O
were O
well O
off O
. O
02 O
The O
Hunt O
Before O
I O
was O
two O
years O
old O
a O
circumstance O
happened O
which O
I O
have O
never O
forgotten O
. O
It O
was O
early O
in O
the O
spring O
; O
there O
had O
been O
a O
little O
frost O
in O
the O
night O
, O
and O
a O
light O
mist O
still O
hung O
over O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
and O
meadows B-LOC
. O
I O
and O
the B-PER
other I-PER
colts I-PER
were O
feeding O
at O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the B-LOC
field I-LOC
when O
we O
heard O
, O
quite O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
what O
sounded O
like O
the O
cry O
of O
dogs O
. O
The O
oldest O
of O
the B-PER
colts I-PER
raised O
his O
head O
, O
pricked O
his O
ears O
, O
and O
said O
, O
“ O
There O
are O
the O
hounds O
! O
” O
and O
immediately O
cantered O
off O
, O
followed O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
to O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
field O
, O
where O
we O
could O
look O
over O
the O
hedge O
and O
see O
several B-LOC
fields I-LOC
beyond I-LOC
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
and O
an O
old O
riding O
horse O
of O
our B-PER
master I-PER
’s O
were O
also O
standing O
near O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
know O
all O
about O
it O
. O
“ O
They O
have O
found O
a O
hare O
, O
” O
said O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
“ O
and O
if O
they O
come O
this O
way O
we O
shall O
see O
the O
hunt O
. O
” O
And O
soon O
the O
dogs O
were O
all O
tearing O
down O
the O
field O
of O
young O
wheat O
next O
to O
ours O
. O
I O
never O
heard O
such O
a O
noise O
as O
they O
made O
. O
They O
did O
not O
bark O
, O
nor O
howl O
, O
nor O
whine O
, O
but O
kept O
on O
a O
“ O
yo O
! O
yo O
, O
o O
, O
o O
! O
yo O
! O
yo O
, O
o O
, O
o O
! O
” O
at O
the O
top O
of O
their O
voices O
. O
After O
them O
came O
a B-PER
number I-PER
of I-PER
men I-PER
on I-PER
horseback I-PER
, O
some B-PER
of I-PER
them I-PER
in O
green O
coats O
, O
all O
galloping O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
could O
. O
The B-PER
old I-PER
horse I-PER
snorted O
and O
looked O
eagerly O
after O
them O
, O
and O
we B-PER
young I-PER
colts I-PER
wanted O
to O
be O
galloping O
with O
them O
, O
but O
they O
were O
soon O
away O
into O
the B-LOC
fields I-LOC
lower I-LOC
down I-LOC
; O
here B-LOC
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
had O
come O
to O
a O
stand O
; O
the O
dogs O
left O
off O
barking O
, O
and O
ran O
about O
every O
way O
with O
their O
noses O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
“ O
They O
have O
lost O
the O
scent O
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
old I-PER
horse I-PER
; O
“ O
perhaps O
the O
hare O
will O
get O
off O
. O
” O
“ O
What O
hare O
? O
” O
I O
said O
. O
“ O
Oh O
! O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
hare O
; O
likely O
enough O
it O
may O
be O
one O
of O
our O
own O
hares O
out O
of O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
; O
any O
hare O
they O
can O
find O
will O
do O
for O
the O
dogs O
and O
men B-PER
to O
run O
after O
; O
” O
and O
before O
long O
the O
dogs O
began O
their O
“ O
yo O
! O
yo O
, O
o O
, O
o O
! O
” O
again O
, O
and O
back O
they O
came O
altogether O
at O
full O
speed O
, O
making O
straight O
for O
our B-LOC
meadow I-LOC
at O
the O
part O
where O
the O
high O
bank O
and O
hedge O
overhang O
the B-LOC
brook I-LOC
. O
“ O
Now O
we O
shall O
see O
the O
hare O
, O
” O
said O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
; O
and O
just O
then O
a O
hare O
wild O
with O
fright O
rushed O
by O
and O
made O
for O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
. O
On O
came O
the O
dogs O
; O
they O
burst O
over O
the O
bank O
, O
leaped O
the B-LOC
stream I-LOC
, O
and O
came O
dashing O
across O
the B-LOC
field I-LOC
followed O
by O
the B-PER
huntsmen I-PER
. O
Six B-PER
or I-PER
eight I-PER
men I-PER
leaped O
their O
horses O
clean O
over O
, O
close O
upon O
the O
dogs O
. O
The O
hare O
tried O
to O
get O
through O
the O
fence O
; O
it O
was O
too O
thick O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
sharp O
round O
to O
make O
for O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
late O
; O
the O
dogs O
were O
upon O
her O
with O
their O
wild O
cries O
; O
we O
heard O
one O
shriek O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
end O
of O
her O
. O
One O
of O
the B-PER
huntsmen I-PER
rode O
up O
and O
whipped O
off O
the O
dogs O
, O
who O
would O
soon O
have O
torn O
her O
to O
pieces O
. O
He O
held O
her O
up O
by O
the O
leg O
torn O
and O
bleeding O
, O
and O
all B-PER
the I-PER
gentlemen I-PER
seemed O
well O
pleased O
. O
As O
for O
me O
, O
I O
was O
so O
astonished O
that O
I O
did O
not O
at O
first O
see O
what O
was O
going O
on O
by O
the B-LOC
brook I-LOC
; O
but O
when O
I O
did O
look O
there O
was O
a O
sad O
sight O
; O
two B-PER
fine I-PER
horses I-PER
were O
down O
, O
one O
was O
struggling O
in O
the B-LOC
stream I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
other O
was O
groaning O
on O
the B-LOC
grass I-LOC
. O
One O
of O
the B-PER
riders I-PER
was O
getting O
out O
of O
the B-LOC
water I-LOC
covered O
with O
mud O
, O
the O
other O
lay O
quite O
still O
. O
“ O
His O
neck O
is O
broke O
, O
” O
said O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
“ O
And O
serve O
him O
right O
, O
too O
, O
” O
said O
one O
of O
the B-PER
colts I-PER
. O
I O
thought O
the O
same O
, O
but O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
did O
not O
join O
with O
us O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
no O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
you O
must O
not O
say O
that O
; O
but O
though O
I O
am O
an B-PER
old I-PER
horse I-PER
, O
and O
have O
seen O
and O
heard O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
I O
never O
yet O
could O
make O
out O
why O
men B-PER
are O
so O
fond O
of O
this O
sport O
; O
they O
often O
hurt O
themselves O
, O
often O
spoil O
good B-PER
horses I-PER
, O
and O
tear O
up O
the B-LOC
fields I-LOC
, O
and O
all O
for O
a O
hare O
or O
a O
fox O
, O
or O
a O
stag O
, O
that O
they O
could O
get O
more O
easily O
some O
other O
way O
; O
but O
we O
are O
only O
horses B-PER
, O
and O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O
” O
While O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
saying O
this O
we O
stood O
and O
looked O
on O
. O
Many O
of O
the B-PER
riders I-PER
had O
gone O
to O
the B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
; O
but O
my B-PER
master I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
been I-PER
watching I-PER
what I-PER
was I-PER
going I-PER
on I-PER
, O
was O
the O
first O
to O
raise O
him O
. O
His O
head O
fell O
back O
and O
his O
arms O
hung O
down O
, O
and O
every B-PER
one I-PER
looked O
very O
serious O
. O
There O
was O
no O
noise O
now O
; O
even O
the O
dogs O
were O
quiet O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
know O
that O
something O
was O
wrong O
. O
They O
carried O
him O
to O
our B-PER
master I-PER
’s O
house O
. O
I O
heard O
afterward O
that O
it O
was O
young B-PER
George I-PER
Gordon I-PER
, O
the B-PER
squire I-PER
’s O
only O
son O
, O
a B-PER
fine I-PER
, I-PER
tall I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, O
and O
the O
pride O
of O
his B-PER
family I-PER
. O
There O
was O
now O
riding O
off O
in O
all O
directions O
to O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
’s O
, O
to O
the B-PER
farrier I-PER
’s O
, O
and O
no O
doubt O
to O
Squire B-PER
Gordon I-PER
’s O
, O
to O
let O
him O
know O
about O
his B-PER
son I-PER
. O
When O
Mr. B-PER
Bond O
, O
the B-PER
farrier I-PER
, O
came O
to O
look O
at O
the B-PER
black I-PER
horse I-PER
that I-PER
lay I-PER
groaning I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
grass I-PER
, O
he O
felt O
him O
all O
over O
, O
and O
shook O
his O
head O
; O
one O
of O
his O
legs O
was O
broken O
. O
Then O
some O
one O
ran O
to O
our B-PER
master I-PER
’s O
house O
and O
came O
back O
with O
a O
gun O
; O
presently O
there O
was O
a O
loud O
bang O
and O
a O
dreadful O
shriek O
, O
and O
then O
all O
was O
still O
; O
the B-PER
black I-PER
horse I-PER
moved O
no O
more O
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
seemed O
much O
troubled O
; O
she O
said O
she O
had O
known O
that B-PER
horse I-PER
for O
years O
, O
and O
that O
his O
name O
was O
“ B-PER
Rob I-PER
Roy I-PER
” I-PER
; O
he O
was O
a B-PER
good I-PER
horse I-PER
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
vice O
in O
him O
. O
She O
never O
would O
go O
to O
that O
part O
of O
the B-LOC
field I-LOC
afterward O
. O
CHAPTER O
I O
THE B-PER
CONSUL I-PER
’S O
YARN O
A O
week O
had O
passed O
since O
the O
funeral O
of O
my B-PER
poor I-PER
boy I-PER
Harry B-PER
, O
and O
one O
evening O
I O
was O
in O
my B-FAC
room I-FAC
walking O
up O
and O
down O
and O
thinking O
, O
when O
there O
was O
a O
ring O
at O
the O
outer O
door O
. O
Going O
down O
the B-FAC
steps I-FAC
I O
opened O
it O
myself O
, O
and O
in O
came O
my B-PER
old I-PER
friends I-PER
Sir B-PER
Henry O
Curtis O
and O
Captain B-PER
John O
Good O
, O
RN O
. O
They O
entered O
the B-FAC
vestibule I-FAC
and O
sat O
themselves O
down O
before O
the O
wide O
hearth O
, O
where O
, O
I O
remember O
, O
a O
particularly O
good O
fire O
of O
logs O
was O
burning O
. O
‘ O
It O
is O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
to O
come O
round O
, O
’ O
I O
said O
by O
way O
of O
making O
a O
remark O
; O
‘ O
it O
must O
have O
been O
heavy O
walking O
in O
the O
snow O
. O
’ O
They O
said O
nothing O
, O
but O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
slowly O
filled O
his O
pipe O
and O
lit O
it O
with O
a O
burning O
ember O
. O
As O
he O
leant O
forward O
to O
do O
so O
the O
fire O
got O
hold O
of O
a O
gassy O
bit O
of O
pine O
and O
flared O
up O
brightly O
, O
throwing O
the O
whole O
scene O
into O
strong O
relief O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
, O
What O
a B-PER
splendid-looking I-PER
man I-PER
he O
is O
! O
Calm O
, O
powerful O
face O
, O
clear-cut O
features O
, O
large O
grey O
eyes O
, O
yellow O
beard O
and O
hair O
-- O
altogether O
a B-PER
magnificent I-PER
specimen I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
higher I-PER
type I-PER
of I-PER
humanity I-PER
. O
Nor O
did O
his O
form O
belie O
his O
face O
. O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
wider O
shoulders O
or O
a O
deeper O
chest O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
’s O
girth O
is O
so O
great O
that O
, O
though O
he O
is O
six O
feet O
two O
high O
, O
he O
does O
not O
strike O
one O
as O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
man I-PER
. O
As O
I O
looked O
at O
him O
I O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
what O
a O
curious O
contrast O
my B-PER
little I-PER
dried-up I-PER
self I-PER
presented O
to O
his O
grand O
face O
and O
form O
. O
Imagine O
to O
yourself O
a B-PER
small I-PER
, I-PER
withered I-PER
, I-PER
yellow-faced I-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
sixty-three I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
thin I-PER
hands I-PER
, I-PER
large I-PER
brown I-PER
eyes I-PER
, I-PER
a I-PER
head I-PER
of I-PER
grizzled I-PER
hair I-PER
cut I-PER
short I-PER
and I-PER
standing I-PER
up I-PER
like I-PER
a I-PER
half-worn I-PER
scrubbing-brush I-PER
-- O
total O
weight O
in O
my O
clothes O
, O
nine O
stone O
six O
-- O
and O
you O
will O
get O
a O
very O
fair O
idea O
of O
Allan B-PER
Quatermain I-PER
, O
commonly O
called O
Hunter B-PER
Quatermain O
, O
or O
by O
the B-PER
natives I-PER
‘ O
Macumazahn B-PER
’ O
-- O
Anglicè O
, O
he O
who O
keeps O
a O
bright O
look-out O
at O
night O
, O
or O
, O
in O
vulgar O
English O
, O
a B-PER
sharp I-PER
fellow I-PER
who I-PER
is I-PER
not I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
taken I-PER
in I-PER
. O
Then O
there O
was O
Good B-PER
, O
who O
is O
not O
like O
either O
of O
us O
, O
being O
short O
, O
dark O
, O
stout O
-- O
_ O
very O
_ O
stout O
-- O
with O
twinkling O
black O
eyes O
, O
in O
one O
of O
which O
an O
eyeglass O
is O
everlastingly O
fixed O
. O
I O
say O
stout O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
mild O
term O
; O
I O
regret O
to O
state O
that O
of O
late O
years O
Good B-PER
has O
been O
running O
to O
fat O
in O
a O
most O
disgraceful O
way O
. O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
tells O
him O
that O
it O
comes O
from O
idleness O
and O
over-feeding O
, O
and O
Good B-PER
does O
not O
like O
it O
at O
all O
, O
though O
he O
can O
not O
deny O
it O
. O
We O
sat O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
then O
I O
got O
a O
match O
and O
lit O
the O
lamp O
that O
stood O
ready O
on O
the O
table O
, O
for O
the O
half-light O
began O
to O
grow O
dreary O
, O
as O
it O
is O
apt O
to O
do O
when O
one O
has O
a O
short O
week O
ago O
buried O
the O
hope O
of O
one O
’s O
life O
. O
Next O
, O
I O
opened O
a O
cupboard O
in O
the O
wainscoting O
and O
got O
a O
bottle O
of O
whisky O
and O
some O
tumblers O
and O
water O
. O
I O
always O
like O
to O
do O
these O
things O
for O
myself O
: O
it O
is O
irritating O
to O
me O
to O
have O
somebody B-PER
continually O
at O
my O
elbow O
, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
an B-PER
eighteen-month-old I-PER
baby I-PER
. O
All O
this O
while O
Curtis B-PER
and O
Good B-PER
had O
been O
silent O
, O
feeling O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
that O
they O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
that O
could O
do O
me O
any O
good O
, O
and O
content O
to O
give O
me O
the O
comfort O
of O
their O
presence O
and O
unspoken O
sympathy O
; O
for O
it O
was O
only O
their O
second O
visit O
since O
the O
funeral O
. O
And O
it O
is O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
from O
the O
_ O
presence O
_ O
of O
others O
that O
we O
really O
derive O
support O
in O
our O
dark O
hours O
of O
grief O
, O
and O
not O
from O
their O
talk O
, O
which O
often O
only O
serves O
to O
irritate O
us O
. O
Before O
a O
bad O
storm O
the O
game O
always O
herd O
together O
, O
but O
they O
cease O
their O
calling O
. O
They O
sat O
and O
smoked O
and O
drank O
whisky O
and O
water O
, O
and O
I O
stood O
by O
the O
fire O
also O
smoking O
and O
looking O
at O
them O
. O
At O
last O
I O
spoke O
. O
‘ O
Old B-PER
friends I-PER
, O
’ O
I O
said O
, O
‘ O
how O
long O
is O
it O
since O
we O
got O
back O
from O
Kukuanaland B-LOC
? O
’ O
‘ O
Three O
years O
, O
’ O
said O
Good B-PER
. O
‘ O
Why O
do O
you O
ask O
? O
’ O
‘ O
I O
ask O
because O
I O
think O
that O
I O
have O
had O
a O
long O
enough O
spell O
of O
civilization O
. O
I O
am O
going O
back O
to O
the B-LOC
veldt I-LOC
. O
’ O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
laid O
his O
head O
back O
in O
his O
arm-chair O
and O
laughed O
one O
of O
his O
deep O
laughs O
. O
‘ O
How O
very O
odd O
, O
’ O
he O
said O
, O
‘ O
eh O
, O
Good B-PER
? O
’ O
Good B-PER
beamed O
at O
me O
mysteriously O
through O
his O
eyeglass O
and O
murmured O
, O
‘ O
Yes O
, O
odd O
-- O
very O
odd O
. O
’ O
‘ O
I O
do O
n’t O
quite O
understand O
, O
’ O
said O
I O
, O
looking O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
, O
for O
I O
dislike O
mysteries O
. O
‘ O
Do O
n’t O
you O
, O
old B-PER
fellow I-PER
? O
’ O
said O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
; O
‘ O
then O
I O
will O
explain O
. O
As O
Good B-PER
and O
I O
were O
walking O
up O
here O
we O
had O
a O
talk O

’ O
‘ O
If O
Good B-PER
was O
there O
you O
probably O
did O
, O
’ O
I O
put O
in O
sarcastically O
, O
for O
Good B-PER
is O
a O
great O
hand O
at O
talking O

‘ O

what O
may O
it O
have O
been O
about O
? O
’ O
‘ O
What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
’ O
asked O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
. O
I O
shook O
my O
head O
. O
It O
was O
not O
likely O
that O
I O
should O
know O
what O
Good B-PER
might O
be O
talking O
about O
. O
He O
talks O
about O
so O
many O
things O
. O
‘ O
Well O
, O
it O
was O
about O
a O
little O
plan O
that O
I O
have O
formed O
-- O
namely O
, O
that O
if O
you O
were O
willing O
we O
should O
pack O
up O
our O
traps O
and O
go O
off O
to O
Africa B-GPE
on O
another O
expedition O
. O
’ O
I O
fairly O
jumped O
at O
his O
words O
. O
‘ O
You O
do O
n’t O
say O
so O
! O
’ O
I O
said O
. O
‘ O
Yes O
I O
do O
, O
though O
, O
and O
so O
does O
Good B-PER
; O
do O
n’t O
you O
, O
Good B-PER
? O
’ O
‘ O
Rather O
, O
’ O
said O
that B-PER
gentleman I-PER
. O
‘ O
Listen O
, O
old B-PER
fellow I-PER
, O
’ O
went O
on O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
, O
with O
considerable O
animation O
of O
manner O
. O
‘ O
I O
’m O
tired O
of O
it O
too O
, O
dead-tired O
of O
doing O
nothing O
more O
except O
play O
the B-PER
squire I-PER
in O
a O
country O
that O
is O
sick O
of O
squires B-PER
. O
For O
a O
year O
or O
more O
I O
have O
been O
getting O
as O
restless O
as O
an O
old O
elephant O
who O
scents O
danger O
. O
I O
am O
always O
dreaming O
of O
Kukuanaland B-LOC
and O
Gagool B-PER
and O
King B-PER
Solomon O
’s O
Mines O
. O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
I O
have O
become O
the B-PER
victim I-PER
of I-PER
an I-PER
almost I-PER
unaccountable I-PER
craving I-PER
. O
I O
am O
sick O
of O
shooting O
pheasants O
and O
partridges O
, O
and O
want O
to O
have O
a O
go O
at O
some O
large O
game O
again O

There O
, O
you O
know O
the O
feeling O
-- O
when O
one O
has O
once O
tasted O
brandy O
and O
water O
, O
milk O
becomes O
insipid O
to O
the O
palate O
. O
That O
year O
we O
spent O
together O
up O
in O
Kukuanaland B-LOC
seems O
to O
me O
worth O
all O
the O
other O
years O
of O
my O
life O
put O
together O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
that O
I O
am O
a B-PER
fool I-PER
for O
my O
pains O

but O
I O
ca O
n’t O

it O

I O
long O

what O
is O
more O
, O
I O

to O
go O

’ O
He O
paused O

then O
went O
on O
again O

‘ O
And O
, O
after O
all O
, O
why O
should O
I O
not O
go O
? O
I O
have O
no B-PER

no O

keep O
me O

If O
anything O

the O

will O
go O
to O
my B-PER

it O

’ O
‘ O

I O

now O
, O
Good B-PER

what O

your O

you O

‘ O
I O

solemnly O

‘ O
I O
never O

anything O

it O

’ O
I O

‘ O
Well O

you O

now O
, O

us O

I O
lit O
my O
pipe O

had O
gone O
out O

before O

‘ O
Have O
you O

’ O
I O
asked O

‘ O
Do O

the B-LOC

’ O

‘ O
Did O
you O

of O

I O

again O

‘ O
No O

it O

’ O
‘ O
Yes O
. O
Now O
listen O
. O
What O
I O
have O
to O
propose O
is O
this O
. O
That O
we O
go O
to O
Lamu B-LOC

thence O
make O
our O
way O
about O
250 O
miles O
inland O
to O
Mt B-LOC
Kenia I-LOC
; O
from O
Mt B-LOC
Kenia I-LOC
on O
inland O
to O
Mt B-LOC
Lekakisera I-LOC
, O
another O
200 O
miles O
, O
or O
thereabouts O
, O
beyond O
which O
no B-PER
white I-PER
man I-PER
has O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
belief O
ever O
been O
; O

then O
, O
if O
we O
get O
so O
far O
, O
right O
on O
into O
the B-LOC
unknown I-LOC
interior I-LOC

What O
do O
you O
say O
to O
that O
, O
my O
hearties O
? O
’ O
‘ O
It O
’s O
a O
big O
order O
, O
’ O
said O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
, O
reflectively O
. O
‘ O
You O
are O
right O
, O
’ O
I O
answered O
, O
‘ O
it O
is O
; O
but O
I O
take O
it O
that O
we O
are O
all O
three O
of O
us O

of O
a O

one O

a O
thorough O
change O

All O
my O
life O
I O
have O
longed O
to O
visit O
those O
parts O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
to O
do O
it O
before O
I O
die O
. O
My B-PER
poor I-PER
boy I-PER

death O
has O
broken O
the O
last O
link O
between O
me O
and O

, O
and O
I O
’m O
off O
to O
my B-LOC
native I-LOC

And O
now O
I O
’ll O
tell O
you O
another O
thing O
, O
and O
that O
is O
, O
that O
for O
years O
and O
years O
I O
have O
heard O
rumours O
of O
a O
great O
white O
race O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
its O
home O
somewhere O
up O
in O
this O
direction O
, O
and O
I O
have O
a O
mind O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
any O
truth O
in O
them O

If O
you B-PER
fellows I-PER
like O
to O
come O
, O
well O

good O
; O
if O
not O
, O
I O
’ll O
go O
alone O
. O
’ O
‘ O
I O
’m O
your B-PER
man I-PER
, O
though O
I O
do O
n’t O
believe O
in O
your O
white O
race O
, O
’ O
said O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
Curtis O
, O
rising O
and O
placing O
his O
arm O
upon O
my O
shoulder O
. O
‘ O
Ditto O
, O
’ O
remarked O
Good B-PER
. O
‘ O
I O
’ll O
go O
into O
training O
at O
once O

By O
all O
means O
let O

go O
to O
Mt B-GPE
Kenia I-GPE

the B-GPE
other I-GPE
place I-GPE
with I-GPE
an I-GPE
unpronounceable I-GPE
name I-GPE
, O
and O
look O
for O
a O
white O
race O
that O
does O
not O
exist O
. O
It O
’s O
all O
one O
to O
me O
. O
’ O
‘ O
When O
do O
you O
propose O
to O
start O
? O
’ O
asked O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
. O
‘ O
This O
day O
month O
, O
’ O
I O
answered O
, O
‘ O
by O
the B-VEH
British I-VEH
India I-VEH
steamboat I-VEH
; O
and O
do O
n’t O
you O
be O
so O
certain O
that O
things O
have O
no O
existence O
because O
you O
do O
not O
happen O
to O
have O
heard O
of O
them O
. O
Remember O
King B-PER
Solomon O
’s O
mines O
! O
’ O
Some O
fourteen O
weeks O
or O
so O
had O
passed O
since O
the O
date O
of O
this O
conversation O
, O
and O
this O
history O
goes O
on O
its O
way O
in O
very O
different O
surroundings O
. O
The O
" O
Red O
Death O
" O
had O
long O
devastated O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
. O
No O
pestilence O
had O
ever O
been O
so O
fatal O
, O
or O
so O
hideous O
. O
Blood O
was O
its O
Avatar O
and O
its O
seal O
-- O
the O
redness O
and O
the O
horror O
of O
blood O
. O
There O
were O
sharp O
pains O
, O
and O
sudden O
dizziness O
, O
and O
then O
profuse O
bleeding O
at O
the O
pores O
, O
with O
dissolution O
. O
The O
scarlet O
stains O
upon O
the O
body O
and O
especially O
upon O
the O
face O
of O
the B-PER
victim I-PER
, O
were O
the O
pest O
ban O
which O
shut O
him O
out O
from O
the O
aid O
and O
from O
the O
sympathy O
of O
his B-PER
fellow-men I-PER
. O
And O
the O
whole O
seizure O
, O
progress O
and O
termination O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
were O
the O
incidents O
of O
half O
an O
hour O
. O
But O
the B-PER
Prince I-PER
Prospero B-PER
was O
happy O
and O
dauntless O
and O
sagacious O
. O
When O
his B-LOC
dominions I-LOC
were O
half O
depopulated O
, O
he O
summoned O
to O
his O
presence O
a O
thousand O
hale O
and O
light-hearted O
friends O
from O
among O
the B-PER
knights I-PER
and O
dames O
of O
his B-LOC
court I-LOC
, O
and O
with O
these O
retired O
to O
the O
deep O
seclusion O
of O
one O
of O
his B-FAC
castellated I-FAC
abbeys I-FAC
. O
This O
was O
an B-FAC
extensive I-FAC
and I-FAC
magnificent I-FAC
structure I-FAC
, O
the O
creation O
of O
the B-PER
prince I-PER
's O
own O
eccentric O
yet O
august O
taste O
. O
A O
strong O
and O
lofty O
wall O
girdled O
it O
in O
. O
This O
wall O
had O
gates O
of O
iron O
. O
The B-PER
courtiers I-PER
, O
having O
entered O
, O
brought O
furnaces O
and O
massy O
hammers O
and O
welded O
the O
bolts O
. O
They O
resolved O
to O
leave O
means O
neither O
of O
ingress O
nor O
egress O
to O
the O
sudden O
impulses O
of O
despair O
or O
of O
frenzy O
from O
within O
. O
The B-FAC
abbey I-FAC
was O
amply O
provisioned O
. O
With O
such O
precautions O
the B-PER
courtiers I-PER
might O
bid O
defiance O
to O
contagion O
. O
The B-LOC
external I-LOC
world I-LOC
could O
take O
care O
of O
itself O
. O
In O
the O
meantime O
it O
was O
folly O
to O
grieve O
, O
or O
to O
think O
. O
The B-PER
prince I-PER
had O
provided O
all O
the O
appliances O
of O
pleasure O
. O
There O
were O
buffoons B-PER
, O
there O
were O
improvisatori B-PER
, O
there O
were O
ballet-dancers B-PER
, O
there O
were O
musicians B-PER
, O
there O
was O
Beauty O
, O
there O
was O
wine O
. O
All O
these O
and O
security O
were O
within O
. O
Without O
was O
the O
" O
Red O
Death O
" O
. O
It O
was O
towards O
the O
close O
of O
the O
fifth O
or O
sixth O
month O
of O
his O
seclusion O
, O
and O
while O
the O
pestilence O
raged O
most O
furiously O
abroad O
, O
that O
the B-PER
Prince I-PER
Prospero B-PER
entertained O
his B-PER
thousand I-PER
friends I-PER
at O
a O
masked O
ball O
of O
the O
most O
unusual O
magnificence O
. O
It O
was O
a O
voluptuous O
scene O
, O
that O
masquerade O
. O
But O
first O
let O
me O
tell O
of O
the B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
in I-FAC
which I-FAC
it I-FAC
was I-FAC
held I-FAC
. O
These O
were O
seven O
-- O
an B-FAC
imperial I-FAC
suite I-FAC
. O
In O
many B-FAC
palaces I-FAC
, O
however O
, O
such B-FAC
suites I-FAC
form O
a O
long O
and O
straight O
vista O
, O
while O
the O
folding O
doors O
slide O
back O
nearly O
to O
the O
walls O
on O
either O
hand O
, O
so O
that O
the O
view O
of O
the O
whole O
extent O
is O
scarcely O
impeded O
. O
Here O
the O
case O
was O
very O
different O
, O
as O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
from O
the B-PER
duke I-PER
's O
love O
of O
the O
_ O
bizarre O
_ O
. O
The B-FAC
apartments I-FAC
were O
so O
irregularly O
disposed O
that O
the O
vision O
embraced O
but O
little O
more O
than O
one O
at O
a O
time O
. O
There O
was O
a O
sharp O
turn O
at O
every O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
yards O
, O
and O
at O
each O
turn O
a O
novel O
effect O
. O
To O
the O
right O
and O
left O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
each O
wall O
, O
a O
tall O
and O
narrow O
Gothic O
window O
looked O
out O
upon O
a O
closed O
corridor O
which O
pursued O
the O
windings O
of O
the B-FAC
suite I-FAC
. O
These O
windows O
were O
of O
stained O
glass O
whose O
colour O
varied O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
prevailing O
hue O
of O
the O
decorations O
of O
the B-FAC
chamber I-FAC
into I-FAC
which I-FAC
it I-FAC
opened I-FAC
. O
That O
at O
the O
eastern O
extremity O
was O
hung O
, O
for O
example O
in O
blue O
-- O
and O
vividly O
blue O
were O
its O
windows O
. O
The B-FAC
second I-FAC
chamber I-FAC
was O
purple O
in O
its O
ornaments O
and O
tapestries O
, O
and O
here B-FAC
the O
panes O
were O
purple O
. O
The B-FAC
third I-FAC
was O
green O
throughout O
, O
and O
so O
were O
the O
casements O
. O
The B-FAC
fourth I-FAC
was O
furnished O
and O
lighted O
with O
orange O
-- O
the O
fifth O
with O
white O
-- O
the O
sixth O
with O
violet O
. O
The B-FAC
seventh I-FAC
apartment I-FAC
was O
closely O
shrouded O
in O
black O
velvet O
tapestries O
that O
hung O
all O
over O
the O
ceiling O
and O
down O
the O
walls O
, O
falling O
in O
heavy O
folds O
upon O
a O
carpet O
of O
the O
same O
material O
and O
hue O
. O
But O
in O
this B-FAC
chamber I-FAC
only O
, O
the O
colour O
of O
the O
windows O
failed O
to O
correspond O
with O
the O
decorations O
. O
The O
panes O
here B-FAC
were O
scarlet O
-- O
a O
deep O
blood O
colour O
. O
Now O
in O
no B-PER
one I-PER
of O
the B-FAC
seven I-FAC
apartments I-FAC
was O
there O
any O
lamp O
or O
candelabrum O
, O
amid O
the O
profusion O
of O
golden O
ornaments O
that O
lay O
scattered O
to O
and O
fro O
or O
depended O
from O
the O
roof O
. O
There O
was O
no O
light O
of O
any O
kind O
emanating O
from O
lamp O
or O
candle O
within O
the B-FAC
suite I-FAC
of I-FAC
chambers I-FAC
. O
But O
in O
the O
corridors O
that O
followed O
the B-FAC
suite I-FAC
, O
there O
stood O
, O
opposite O
to O
each O
window O
, O
a O
heavy O
tripod O
, O
bearing O
a O
brazier O
of O
fire O
, O
that O
projected O
its O
rays O
through O
the O
tinted O
glass O
and O
so O
glaringly O
illumined O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
And O
thus O
were O
produced O
a O
multitude O
of O
gaudy O
and O
fantastic O
appearances O
. O
But O
in O
the B-FAC
western I-FAC
or I-FAC
black I-FAC
chamber I-FAC
the O
effect O
of O
the O
fire-light O
that O
streamed O
upon O
the O
dark O
hangings O
through O
the O
blood-tinted O
panes O
, O
was O
ghastly O
in O
the O
extreme O
, O
and O
produced O
so O
wild O
a O
look O
upon O
the O
countenances O
of O
those O
who O
entered O
, O
that O
there O
were O
few O
of O
the B-PER
company I-PER
bold O
enough O
to O
set O
foot O
within O
its O
precincts O
at O
all O
. O
It O
was O
in O
this B-FAC
apartment I-FAC
, O
also O
, O
that O
there O
stood O
against O
the O
western O
wall O
, O
a O
gigantic O
clock O
of O
ebony O
. O
Its O
pendulum O
swung O
to O
and O
fro O
with O
a O
dull O
, O
heavy O
, O
monotonous O
clang O
; O
and O
when O
the O
minute-hand O
made O
the O
circuit O
of O
the O
face O
, O
and O
the O
hour O
was O
to O
be O
stricken O
, O
there O
came O
from O
the O
brazen O
lungs O
of O
the O
clock O
a O
sound O
which O
was O
clear O
and O
loud O
and O
deep O
and O
exceedingly O
musical O
, O
but O
of O
so O
peculiar O
a O
note O
and O
emphasis O
that O
, O
at O
each O
lapse O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
the B-PER
musicians I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
orchestra I-PER
were O
constrained O
to O
pause O
, O
momentarily O
, O
in O
their O
performance O
, O
to O
harken O
to O
the O
sound O
; O
and O
thus O
the B-PER
waltzers I-PER
perforce O
ceased O
their O
evolutions O
; O
and O
there O
was O
a O
brief O
disconcert O
of O
the B-PER
whole I-PER
gay I-PER
company I-PER
; O
and O
, O
while O
the O
chimes O
of O
the O
clock O
yet O
rang O
, O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
the B-PER
giddiest I-PER
grew O
pale O
, O
and O
the B-PER
more I-PER
aged I-PER
and I-PER
sedate I-PER
passed O
their O
hands O
over O
their O
brows O
as O
if O
in O
confused O
revery O
or O
meditation O
. O
But O
when O
the O
echoes O
had O
fully O
ceased O
, O
a O
light O
laughter O
at O
once O
pervaded O
the B-PER
assembly I-PER
; O
the B-PER
musicians I-PER
looked O
at O
each O
other O
and O
smiled O
as O
if O
at O
their O
own O
nervousness O
and O
folly O
, O
and O
made O
whispering O
vows O
, O
each O
to O
the O
other O
, O
that O
the O
next O
chiming O
of O
the O
clock O
should O
produce O
in O
them O
no O
similar O
emotion O
; O
and O
then O
, O
after O
the O
lapse O
of O
sixty O
minutes O
, O
( O
which O
embrace O
three O
thousand O
and O
six O
hundred O
seconds O
of O
the O
Time O
that O
flies O
, O
) O
there O
came O
yet O
another O
chiming O
of O
the O
clock O
, O
and O
then O
were O
the O
same O
disconcert O
and O
tremulousness O
and O
meditation O
as O
before O
. O
But O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
these O
things O
, O
it O
was O
a O
gay O
and O
magnificent O
revel O
. O
The O
tastes O
of O
the B-PER
duke I-PER
were O
peculiar O
. O
He O
had O
a O
fine O
eye O
for O
colours O
and O
effects O
. O
He O
disregarded O
the O
_ O
decora O
_ O
of O
mere O
fashion O
. O
His O
plans O
were O
bold O
and O
fiery O
, O
and O
his O
conceptions O
glowed O
with O
barbaric O
lustre O
. O
There O
are O
some B-PER
who I-PER
would I-PER
have I-PER
thought I-PER
him I-PER
mad I-PER
. O
His B-PER
followers I-PER
felt O
that O
he O
was O
not O
. O
It O
was O
necessary O
to O
hear O
and O
see O
and O
touch O
him O
to O
be O
_ O
sure O
_ O
that O
he O
was O
not O
. O
He O
had O
directed O
, O
in O
great O
part O
, O
the O
movable O
embellishments O
of O
the B-FAC
seven I-FAC
chambers I-FAC
, O
upon O
occasion O
of O
this O
great O
_ O
fête O
_ O
; O
and O
it O
was O
his O
own O
guiding O
taste O
which O
had O
given O
character O
to O
the B-PER
masqueraders I-PER
. O
Be O
sure O
they O
were O
grotesque O
. O
There O
were O
much O
glare O
and O
glitter O
and O
piquancy O
and O
phantasm O
-- O
much O
of O
what O
has O
been O
since O
seen O
in O
" O
Hernani O
" O
. O
There O
were O
arabesque O
figures O
with O
unsuited O
limbs O
and O
appointments O
. O
There O
were O
delirious O
fancies O
such O
as O
the B-PER
madman I-PER
fashions O
. O
There O
were O
much O
of O
the O
beautiful O
, O
much O
of O
the O
wanton O
, O
much O
of O
the O
_ O
bizarre O
_ O
, O
something O
of O
the O
terrible O
, O
and O
not O
a O
little O
of O
that O
which O
might O
have O
excited O
disgust O
. O
To O
and O
fro O
in O
the B-FAC
seven I-FAC
chambers I-FAC
there O
stalked O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
multitude O
of O
dreams O
. O
And O
these O
-- O
the O
dreams O
-- O
writhed O
in O
and O
about O
taking O
hue O
from O
the B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
, O
and O
causing O
the O
wild O
music O
of O
the B-PER
orchestra I-PER
to O
seem O
as O
the O
echo O
of O
their O
steps O
. O
And O
, O
anon O
, O
there O
strikes O
the O
ebony O
clock O
which O
stands O
in O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
velvet I-FAC
. O
And O
then O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
all O
is O
still O
, O
and O
all O
is O
silent O
save O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
clock O
. O
The O
dreams O
are O
stiff-frozen O
as O
they O
stand O
. O
But O
the O
echoes O
of O
the O
chime O
die O
away O
-- O
they O
have O
endured O
but O
an O
instant O
-- O
and O
a O
light O
, O
half-subdued O
laughter O
floats O
after O
them O
as O
they O
depart O
. O
And O
now O
again O
the O
music O
swells O
, O
and O
the O
dreams O
live O
, O
and O
writhe O
to O
and O
fro O
more O
merrily O
than O
ever O
, O
taking O
hue O
from O
the O
many O
tinted O
windows O
through O
which O
stream O
the O
rays O
from O
the O
tripods O
. O
But O
to O
the O
chamber O
which O
lies O
most O
westwardly O
of O
the B-FAC
seven I-FAC
, O
there O
are O
now O
none O
of O
the B-PER
maskers I-PER
who I-PER
venture I-PER
; O
for O
the O
night O
is O
waning O
away O
; O
and O
there O
flows O
a O
ruddier O
light O
through O
the O
blood-coloured O
panes O
; O
and O
the O
blackness O
of O
the O
sable O
drapery O
appals O
; O
and O
to O
him O
whose O
foot O
falls O
upon O
the O
sable O
carpet O
, O
there O
comes O
from O
the O
near O
clock O
of O
ebony O
a O
muffled O
peal O
more O
solemnly O
emphatic O
than O
any O
which O
reaches O
_ O
their O
_ O
ears O
who O
indulged O
in O
the O
more O
remote O
gaieties O
of O
the O
other O
apartments O
. O
But O
these B-FAC
other I-FAC
apartments I-FAC
were O
densely O
crowded O
, O
and O
in O
them O
beat O
feverishly O
the O
heart O
of O
life O
. O
And O
the O
revel O
went O
whirlingly O
on O
, O
until O
at O
length O
there O
commenced O
the O
sounding O
of O
midnight O
upon O
the O
clock O
. O
And O
then O
the O
music O
ceased O
, O
as O
I O
have O
told O
; O
and O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the B-PER
waltzers I-PER
were O
quieted O
; O
and O
there O
was O
an O
uneasy O
cessation O
of O
all O
things O
as O
before O
. O
But O
now O
there O
were O
twelve O
strokes O
to O
be O
sounded O
by O
the O
bell O
of O
the O
clock O
; O
and O
thus O
it O
happened O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
more O
of O
thought O
crept O
, O
with O
more O
of O
time O
, O
into O
the O
meditations O
of O
the O
thoughtful O
among O
those B-PER
who I-PER
revelled I-PER
. O
And O
thus O
too O
, O
it O
happened O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
before O
the O
last O
echoes O
of O
the O
last O
chime O
had O
utterly O
sunk O
into O
silence O
, O
there O
were O
many O
individuals O
in O
the O
crowd O
who O
had O
found O
leisure O
to O
become O
aware O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
masked O
figure O
which O
had O
arrested O
the O
attention O
of O
no B-PER
single I-PER
individual I-PER
before O
. O
And O
the O
rumour O
of O
this B-PER
new I-PER
presence I-PER
having O
spread O
itself O
whisperingly O
around O
, O
there O
arose O
at O
length O
from O
the B-PER
whole I-PER
company I-PER
a O
buzz O
, O
or O
murmur O
, O
expressive O
of O
disapprobation O
and O
surprise O
-- O
then O
, O
finally O
, O
of O
terror O
, O
of O
horror O
, O
and O
of O
disgust O
. O
In O
an O
assembly O
of O
phantasms O
such O
as O
I O
have O
painted O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
supposed O
that O
no O
ordinary O
appearance O
could O
have O
excited O
such O
sensation O
. O
In O
truth O
the O
masquerade O
licence O
of O
the O
night O
was O
nearly O
unlimited O
; O
but O
the B-PER
figure I-PER
in I-PER
question I-PER
had O
out-Heroded O
Herod B-PER
, O
and O
gone O
beyond O
the O
bounds O
of O
even O
the B-PER
prince I-PER
's O
indefinite O
decorum O
. O
There O
are O
chords O
in O
the O
hearts O
of O
the B-PER
most I-PER
reckless I-PER
which O
can O
not O
be O
touched O
without O
emotion O
. O
Even O
with O
the O
utterly O
lost O
, O
to O
whom O
life O
and O
death O
are O
equally O
jests O
, O
there O
are O
matters O
of O
which O
no O
jest O
can O
be O
made O
. O
The B-PER
whole I-PER
company I-PER
, O
indeed O
, O
seemed O
now O
deeply O
to O
feel O
that O
in O
the O
costume O
and O
bearing O
of O
the B-PER
stranger I-PER
neither O
wit O
nor O
propriety O
existed O
. O
The B-PER
figure I-PER
was O
tall O
and O
gaunt O
, O
and O
shrouded O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
in O
the O
habiliments O
of O
the O
grave O
. O
The O
mask O
which O
concealed O
the O
visage O
was O
made O
so O
nearly O
to O
resemble O
the O
countenance O
of O
a O
stiffened O
corpse O
that O
the O
closest O
scrutiny O
must O
have O
had O
difficulty O
in O
detecting O
the O
cheat O
. O
And O
yet O
all O
this O
might O
have O
been O
endured O
, O
if O
not O
approved O
, O
by O
the B-PER
mad I-PER
revellers I-PER
around I-PER
. O
But O
the B-PER
mummer I-PER
had O
gone O
so O
far O
as O
to O
assume O
the O
type O
of O
the O
Red O
Death O
. O
His O
vesture O
was O
dabbled O
in O
_ O
blood O
_ O
-- O
and O
his O
broad O
brow O
, O
with O
all O
the O
features O
of O
the O
face O
, O
was O
besprinkled O
with O
the O
scarlet O
horror O
. O

We O

the O

what O

when O
Paul B-PER

From O

you O
go O
right O

into O
dining-room B-FAC

drawing-room B-FAC

Hall B-PER
itself O
is O
practically O
a B-FAC
room I-FAC

You O
open O
another O
door O
in O
it O
, O
and O
there O
are O
the B-FAC
stairs I-FAC
going O
up O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
tunnel O
to O
the B-FAC
first-floor I-FAC

Three B-FAC

in I-FAC
a I-FAC
row I-FAC
there B-FAC

and O
three B-FAC
attics I-FAC
in I-FAC
a I-FAC

above I-FAC
. O
That O
is O
n't O
all O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
really O
, O
but O
it O
's O
all O
that O
one O
notices O
-- O
nine O
windows O
as O
you O
look O
up O
from O
the B-FAC
front I-FAC

Then O
there O
's O
a O
very O
big O
wych-elm O

to O
the O

as O
you O
look O
up O
-- O
leaning O
a O
little O
over O
the B-FAC

and O
standing O
on O
the O
boundary O

I O
quite O
love O

no O

No O

However O
, O
I O
must O
get O
on O

my B-PER

hostess B-PER

I O
only O
wanted O
to O
show O
that O
it O
is O

the O
least O
what O
we O
expected O

Why O
did O
we O
settle O
that O
their B-FAC

would O
be O
all B-FAC
gables I-FAC
and I-FAC
wiggles I-FAC
, O
and O
their B-FAC
garden I-FAC
all O
gamboge-coloured B-FAC
paths I-FAC
? O
I O
believe O
simply O
because O
we O
associate O
them O
with O
expensive B-FAC
hotels I-FAC

We O

I O
shall O
be O
back O
Saturday O
; O
will O
let O
you O
know O

later O

They O
are O
as O
angry O
as O
I O
am O
that O
you O
did O
not O
come O
too O
; O
really O
Tibby B-PER
is O
too O
tiresome O
, O
he O
starts O
a O
new O
mortal O
disease O
every O
month O
. O
How O
could O
he O
have O
got O
hay O
fever O
in O
London B-GPE
? O
and O
even O
if O
he O
could O
, O
it O
seems O
hard O
that O
you O
should O
give O
up O
a O
visit O
to O
hear O
a B-PER
schoolboy I-PER
sneeze O
. O
Tell O
him O
that O
Charles B-PER
Wilcox I-PER
( O
the O
son O
who O
is O
here B-FAC
) O
has O
hay O
fever O
too O
, O
but O
he O
's O
brave O
, O
and O
gets O
quite O
cross O
when O
we O
inquire O
after O
it O
. O
Men O
like O
the B-PER
Wilcoxes I-PER
would O
do O
Tibby B-PER
a O
power O
of O
good O
. O
But O
you O
wo O
n't O
agree O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
better O
change O
the O
subject O
. O
This O
long O
letter O
is O
because O
I O
'm O
writing O
before O
breakfast O
. O
Oh O
, O
the O
beautiful O
vine O
leaves O
! O
The B-FAC
house I-FAC
is O
covered O
with O
a O
vine O
. O
I O
looked O
out O
earlier O
, O
and O
Mrs. B-PER
Wilcox O
was O
already O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
She O
evidently O
loves O
it O
. O
No O
wonder O
she O
sometimes O
looks O
tired O
. O
She O
was O
watching O
the O
large O
red O
poppies O
come O
out O
. O
Then O
she O
walked O
off O
the B-FAC
lawn I-FAC
to O
the O
meadow O
, O
whose B-LOC
corner I-LOC
to I-LOC
the I-LOC
right I-LOC
I O
can O
just O
see O
. O
Trail O
, O
trail O
, O
went O
her O
long O
dress O
over O
the O
sopping O
grass O
, O
and O
she O
came O
back O
with O
her O
hands O
full O
of O
the O
hay O
that O
was O
cut O
yesterday O
-- O
I O
suppose O
for O
rabbits O
or O
something O
, O
as O
she O
kept O
on O
smelling O
it O
. O
The O
air O
here O
is O
delicious O
. O
Later O
on O
I O
heard O
the O
noise O
of O
croquet O
balls O
, O
and O
looked O
out O
again O
, O
and O
it O
was O
Charles B-PER
Wilcox I-PER
practising O
; O
they O
are O
keen O
on O
all O
games O
. O
Presently O
he O
started O
sneezing O
and O
had O
to O
stop O
. O
Then O
I O
hear O
more O
clicketing O
, O
and O
it O
is O
Mr. B-PER
Wilcox O
practising O
, O
and O
then O
, O
' O
a-tissue O
, O
a-tissue O
' O
: O
he O
has O
to O
stop O
too O
. O
Then O

does O
some O

Mrs. B-PER

reappears O

trail O

still O
smelling O
hay O
and O
looking O
at O
the O

. O
I O
inflict O
all O
this O
on O
you O
because O
once O
you O
said O
that O
life O
is O
sometimes O
life O
and O
sometimes O
only O
a O
drama O
, O
and O
one O
must O
learn O
to O
distinguish O
t O
' O
other O
from O
which O
, O
and O
up O
to O
now O
I O
have O
always O
put O
that O
down O
as O
' O
Meg B-PER
's O
clever O
nonsense O
. O
' O
But O
this O
morning O
, O
it O
really O
does O
seem O
not O
life O
but O
a O
play O
, O
and O
it O
did O
amuse O
me O
enormously O
to O
watch O
the B-PER

Now O
Mrs. B-PER

Mrs. B-PER

wore O
an O

So O
it O
is O
n't O
exactly O
a B-FAC
go-as-you-please I-FAC
place I-FAC
, O
and O
if O
you O
shut O
your O
eyes O
it O
still O
seems O
the B-FAC
wiggly I-FAC
hotel I-FAC
that I-FAC
we I-FAC
expected I-FAC
. O
Not O
if O
you O
open O
them O
. O
The O
dog-roses O
are O
too O
sweet O
. O
There O
is O
a O
great O
hedge O
of O
them O
over O
the B-FAC
lawn I-FAC
-- O
magnificently O
tall O
, O
so O
that O
they O
fall O
down O
in O
garlands O
, O
and O
nice O
and O
thin O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
so O
that O
you O
can O
see O
ducks O
through O
it O
and O
a O
cow O
. O
These O
belong O
to O
the B-FAC
farm I-FAC

which O
is O

Dearest B-PER

I O
am O

a O
glorious O

I O
like O

all O

Mrs. B-PER
Wilcox O
, O
if O
quieter O
than O
in O
Germany B-GPE
, O
is O
sweeter O
than O
ever O
, O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
anything O
like O
her O
steady O
unselfishness O
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
it O
is O
that O
the O
others O
do O
not O
take O
advantage O
of O
her O
. O
They O
are O
the B-PER
very I-PER
happiest I-PER

jolliest I-PER
family I-PER
that I-PER
you I-PER
can I-PER
imagine I-PER
. O
I O
do O
really O
feel O
that O
we O
are O
making O
friends B-PER

The O
fun O
of O
it O
is O
that O
they O
think O
me O
a B-PER

say O
so O

at O

Mr. B-PER

when O

it O

a O

He O

when O
I O
said O

he O
just O
folded O
his O

gave O
me O
such O
a O

I O

never O

Meg B-PER

shall O
we O

less O

I O
never O
felt O
so O
ashamed O
of O
myself O
in O
my O

I O
could O
n't O
point O
to O
a O
time O
when O
men B-PER
had O
been O
equal O

nor O
even O
to O
a O
time O
when O
the O
wish O
to O

had O
made O
them O
happier O
in O
other O
ways O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
say O
a O
word O
. O
I O
had O
just O
picked O
up O
the O
notion O
that O
equality O
is O
good O
from O
some O
book O
-- O
probably O
from O
poetry O

or O
you O

Anyhow O

that O
we O
made O
from O
Heidelberg B-GPE

Speyer B-GPE

Helen B-PER

I O
had O
got O
it O
into O
our O
heads O
that O
there O
was O
a O
grand O
old O
cathedral O
at O
Speyer B-GPE
-- O
the O
Archbishop O
of O
Speyer B-GPE
was O
one O
of O
the B-PER
seven I-PER
electors I-PER

Speyer B-PER

Koln B-PER

Those O

once O
commanded O
the B-LOC
Rhine I-LOC

got O
it O
the O
name O
of O
Priest B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O
" O
" O
I O
still O
feel O
quite O
uneasy O
about O
this O
business O
, O
Margaret B-PER
. O
" O
" O
The B-VEH
train I-VEH
crossed O
by O
a O
bridge O
of O
boats B-VEH
, O
and O
at O
first O
sight O
it O
looked O
quite O
fine O
. O
But O
oh O
, O
in O
five O
minutes O
we O
had O
seen O
the B-FAC
whole I-FAC
thing I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
cathedral I-FAC
had O
been O
ruined O
, O
absolutely O
ruined O
, O
by O
restoration O
; O
not O
an O
inch O
left O
of O
the B-FAC
original I-FAC
structure I-FAC
. O
We O
wasted O
a O
whole O
day O
, O
and O
came O
across O
the B-PER
Wilcoxes I-PER
as O
we O
were O
eating O
our O
sandwiches O
in O
the B-FAC
public I-FAC
gardens I-FAC
. O
They O
too O
, O
poor B-PER
things I-PER
, O
had O
been O
taken O
in O
-- O
they O
were O
actually O
stopping O
at O
Speyer B-GPE
-- O
and O
they O
rather O
liked O
Helen B-PER
insisting O
that O
they O
must O
fly O
with O
us O
to O
Heidelberg B-GPE
. O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
they O
did O
come O
on O
next O
day O
. O
We O
all O
took O
some O
drives O
together O
. O
They O
knew O
us O
well O
enough O
to O
ask O
Helen B-PER
to O
come O
and O
see O
them O
-- O
at O
least O
, O
I O
was O
asked O
too O
, O
but O
Tibby B-PER
's O
illness O
prevented O
me O
, O
so O
last O
Monday O
she O
went O
alone O
. O
That O
's O
all O
. O
You O
know O
as O
much O
as O
I O
do O
now O
. O
It O
's O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
out I-PER
the I-PER
unknown I-PER
. O
She O
was O
to O
have O
come O
back O
Saturday O
, O
but O
put O
off O
till O
Monday O
, O
perhaps O
on O
account O
of O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
She O
broke O
off O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
sounds O
of O
a O
London B-GPE
morning O
. O
Their B-FAC
house I-FAC
was O
in O
Wickham B-FAC
Place I-FAC
, O
and O
fairly O
quiet O
, O
for O
a O
lofty O
promontory O
of O
buildings B-FAC
separated O
it O
from O
the B-FAC
main I-FAC
thoroughfare I-FAC
. O
One O
had O
the O
sense O
of O
a B-LOC
backwater I-LOC
, O
or O
rather O
of O
an O
estuary O
, O
whose O
waters O
flowed O
in O
from O
the B-LOC
invisible I-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
and O
ebbed O
into O
a O
profound O
silence O
while O
the O
waves O
without O
were O
still O
beating O
. O
Though O
the B-LOC
promontory I-LOC
consisted O
of O
flats B-FAC

expensive O
, O
with O
cavernous B-FAC
entrance I-FAC
halls I-FAC

full O
of O
concierges B-PER

it O
fulfilled O
its O
purpose O

and O
gained O
for O
the B-FAC
older I-FAC
houses I-FAC
opposite I-FAC
a O
certain O
measure O
of O
peace O
. O
These O
, O
too O
, O
would O
be O
swept O
away O
in O
time O
, O
and O
another B-LOC
promontory I-LOC
would O
rise O
upon O
their B-FAC
site I-FAC

as O
humanity O
piled O
itself O
higher O

On O
my O
occasional O
visits O
to O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
aforesaid I-GPE
, O
I O
seldom O
failed O
to O
turn O
down O
Pyncheon B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
passing O
through O
the O
shadow O
of O
these O
two O
antiquities O
, O
-- O
the O
great O
elm-tree O
and O
the B-FAC
weather-beaten I-FAC
edifice I-FAC
. O
The O
aspect O
of O
the B-FAC
venerable I-FAC
mansion I-FAC
has O
always O
affected O
me O
like O
a O
human O
countenance O
, O
bearing O
the O
traces O
not O
merely O
of O
outward O
storm O
and O
sunshine O
, O
but O
expressive O
also O
, O
of O
the O
long O
lapse O
of O
mortal O
life O
, O
and O
accompanying O
vicissitudes O
that O
have O
passed O
within O
. O
Were O
these O
to O
be O
worthily O
recounted O
, O
they O
would O
form O
a O
narrative O
of O
no O
small O
interest O
and O
instruction O
, O
and O
possessing O
, O
moreover O
, O
a O
certain O
remarkable O
unity O
, O
which O
might O
almost O
seem O
the O
result O
of O
artistic O
arrangement O
. O
But O
the O
story O
would O
include O
a O
chain O
of O
events O
extending O
over O
the O
better O
part O
of O
two O
centuries O
, O
and O
, O
written O
out O
with O
reasonable O
amplitude O
, O
would O
fill O
a O
bigger O
folio O
volume O
, O
or O
a O
longer O
series O
of O
duodecimos O
, O
than O
could O
prudently O
be O
appropriated O
to O
the O
annals O
of O
all B-LOC
New I-LOC
England I-LOC
during O
a O
similar O
period O
. O
It O
consequently O
becomes O
imperative O
to O
make O
short O
work O
with O
most O
of O
the O
traditionary O
lore O
of O
which O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
Pyncheon I-FAC
House I-FAC
, O
otherwise O
known O
as O
the B-FAC
House I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
Seven I-FAC
Gables I-FAC
, O
has O
been O
the O
theme O
. O
With O
a O
brief O
sketch O
, O
therefore O
, O
of O
the O
circumstances O
amid O
which O
the O
foundation O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
was O
laid O
, O
and O
a O
rapid O
glimpse O
at O
its B-FAC
quaint I-FAC
exterior I-FAC
, O
as O
it O
grew O
black O
in O
the O
prevalent O
east O
wind O
, O
-- O
pointing O
, O
too O
, O
here O
and O
there O
, O
at O
some O
spot O
of O
more O
verdant O
mossiness O
on O
its B-FAC
roof I-FAC
and O
walls O
, O
-- O
we O
shall O
commence O
the O
real O
action O
of O
our O
tale O
at O
an O
epoch O
not O
very O
remote O
from O
the O
present O
day O
. O
Still O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
long O
past O
-- O
a O
reference O
to O
forgotten O
events O
and O
personages B-PER
, O
and O
to O
manners O
, O
feelings O
, O
and O
opinions O
, O
almost O
or O
wholly O
obsolete O
-- O
which O
, O
if O
adequately O
translated O
to O
the O
reader O
, O
would O
serve O
to O
illustrate O
how O
much O
of O
old O
material O
goes O
to O
make O
up O
the O
freshest O
novelty O
of O
human O
life O
. O
Hence O
, O
too O
, O
might O
be O
drawn O
a O
weighty O
lesson O
from O
the O
little-regarded O
truth O
, O
that O
the O
act O
of O
the B-PER
passing I-PER
generation I-PER
is O
the O
germ O
which O
may O
and O
must O
produce O
good O
or O
evil O

thirty O

the O

on O

an B-PER

Our O

unjust O

to O

whether O
Colonel B-PER

Matthew B-PER

What O
greatly O
strengthens O
such O
a O
suspicion O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
controversy O
between O
two B-PER
ill-matched I-PER
antagonists I-PER
-- O
at O
a O
period O
, O
moreover O
, O
laud O
it O
as O
we O
may O

when O
personal O
influence O

far O
more O
weight O
than O
now O

remained O
for O

came O
to O
a O
close O
only O
with O
the O
death O
of O
the O
party O
occupying O
the B-LOC
disputed I-LOC
soil I-LOC

The O
mode O
of O
his O
death O
, O
too O
, O
affects O
the O
mind O
differently O
, O
in O
our O
day O
, O
from O
what O
it O
did O
a O
century O

a O
half O

It O
was O
a O
death O
that O
blasted O
with O
strange O
horror O
the O
humble O
name O
of O
the O
dweller O
in O
the B-FAC
cottage I-FAC
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
almost O
a O
religious O
act O
to O
drive O
the O
plough O
over O
the O
little O
area O
of O
his B-FAC
habitation I-FAC

and O
obliterate O
his O

men B-PER

Old B-PER
Matthew I-PER
Maule I-PER
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
was O
executed O
for O
the O
crime O
of O
witchcraft O
. O
He O
was O
one O
of O
the B-PER
martyrs I-PER
to I-PER
that I-PER
terrible I-PER
delusion I-PER
, O
which O
should O
teach O
us O
, O
among O
its O
other O
morals O
, O
that O
the B-PER
influential I-PER
classes I-PER
, O
and O
those O
who O
take O
upon O
themselves O
to O
be O
leaders O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
, O
are O
fully O
liable O
to O
all O
the O
passionate O
error O
that O
has O
ever O
characterized O
the B-PER
maddest I-PER
mob I-PER

Clergymen B-PER

the B-PER
wisest I-PER

holiest I-PER
persons I-PER
of I-PER
their I-PER
day I-PER
stood O
in O
the O
inner O
circle O
round O
about O
the B-FAC

, O
loudest O
to O
applaud O
the O
work O

themselves O
miserably O

If O
any O
one O
part O
of O
their O
proceedings O
can O
be O
said O
to O
deserve O
less O
blame O
than O
another O
, O
it O
was O
the O
singular O
indiscrimination O
with O
which O
they O
persecuted O
, O
not O
merely O
the B-PER
poor I-PER
and I-PER
aged I-PER
, O
as O
in O
former O
judicial O

people B-PER

all I-PER
ranks I-PER

their B-PER
own I-PER

Amid O
the O
disorder O
of O
such O
various O
ruin O
, O
it O
is O
not O
strange O
that O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
inconsiderable I-PER
note I-PER
, O
like O
Maule B-PER
, O
should O
have O
trodden O
the B-PER
martyr I-PER

path O
to O
the O
hill O
of O
execution O
almost O
unremarked O
in O
the O
throng O
of O
his B-PER
fellow I-PER
sufferers I-PER

But O
, O
in O
after O
days O
, O
when O
the O
frenzy O
of O
that O
hideous O
epoch O
had O
subsided O
, O
it O
was O
remembered O
how O
loudly O
Colonel B-PER
Pyncheon I-PER
had O
joined O
in O
the O
general O
cry O
, O
to O
purge O
the B-LOC
land I-LOC
from O
witchcraft O
; O
nor O
did O
it O
fail O
to O
be O
whispered O
, O
that O
there O
was O
an O
invidious O
acrimony O
in O
the O
zeal O
with O
which O
he O
had O
sought O
the O
condemnation O
of O
Matthew B-PER
Maule I-PER
. O
It O
was O
well O
known O
that O
the B-PER
victim I-PER
had O
recognized O
the O
bitterness O
of O
personal O
enmity O
in O
his B-PER
persecutor I-PER
's O
conduct O
towards O
him O
, O
and O
that O
he O
declared O
himself O
hunted O
to O
death O
for O
his O
spoil O
. O
At O
the O
moment O
of O
execution O
-- O
with O
the O
halter O
about O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
while O
Colonel B-PER
Pyncheon I-PER
sat O
on O
horseback O
, O
grimly O
gazing O
at O
the O
scene O
Maule B-PER
had O
addressed O
him O
from O
the O
scaffold O
, O
and O
uttered O
a O
prophecy O
, O
of O
which O
history O
, O
as O
well O
as O
fireside O
tradition O
, O
has O
preserved O
the O
very O
words O
. O
" O
God O
, O
" O
said O
the B-PER
dying I-PER
man I-PER
, O
pointing O
his O
finger O
, O
with O
a O
ghastly O
look O
, O
at O
the O
undismayed O
countenance O
of O
his B-PER
enemy I-PER
, O
-- O
" O
God O
will O
give O
him O
blood O
to O
drink O
! O
" O
After O
the B-PER
reputed I-PER
wizard I-PER
's O
death O
, O
his B-LOC
humble I-LOC
homestead I-LOC
had O
fallen O
an O
easy O
spoil O
into O
Colonel B-PER
Pyncheon I-PER
's O
grasp O
. O
When O
it O
was O
understood O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the B-PER
Colonel I-PER
intended O
to O
erect O
a O
family O
mansion-spacious O
, O
ponderously O
framed O
of O
oaken O
timber O
, O
and O
calculated O
to O
endure O
for O
many B-PER
generations I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
posterity I-PER
over O
the O
spot O
first O
covered O
by O
the O
log-built O
hut O
of O
Matthew B-PER
Maule I-PER
, O
there O
was O
much O
shaking O
of O
the O
head O
among O
the B-PER
village I-PER
gossips I-PER
. O
Without O
absolutely O
expressing O
a O
doubt O
whether O
the B-PER
stalwart I-PER
Puritan I-PER
had O
acted O
as O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
conscience I-PER
and I-PER
integrity I-PER
throughout O
the O
proceedings O
which O
have O
been O
sketched O
, O
they O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
hinted O
that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
build O
his B-FAC
house I-FAC
over O
an B-FAC
unquiet I-FAC
grave I-FAC
. O
His B-FAC
home I-FAC
would O
include O
the O
home O
of O
the B-PER
dead I-PER
and I-PER
buried I-PER
wizard I-PER
, O
and O
would O
thus O
afford O
the O
ghost O
of O
the O
latter O
a O
kind O
of O
privilege O
to O
haunt O
its B-FAC
new I-FAC
apartments I-FAC
, O
and O
the O
chambers O
into O
which O
future B-PER
bridegrooms I-PER
were O
to O
lead O
their B-PER
brides I-PER
, O
and O
where O
children B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
Pyncheon I-PER
blood I-PER
were O
to O
be O
born O
. O
The O
terror O
and O
ugliness O
of O
Maule B-PER
's O
crime O
, O
and O
the O
wretchedness O
of O
his O
punishment O
, O
would O
darken O
the O
freshly O
plastered O
walls O
, O
and O
infect O
them O
early O
with O
the O
scent O
of O
an B-FAC
old I-FAC
and I-FAC
melancholy I-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
Why O
, O
then O
, O
-- O
while O
so B-LOC
much I-LOC
of I-LOC
the I-LOC
soil I-LOC
around I-LOC
him I-LOC
was O
bestrewn O
with O
the O
virgin O
forest O
leaves O
, O
-- O
why O
should O
Colonel B-PER
Pyncheon I-PER
prefer O
a B-LOC
site I-LOC
that I-LOC
had I-LOC
already I-LOC
been I-LOC
accurst I-LOC
? O
But O
the B-PER
Puritan I-PER
soldier I-PER
and O
magistrate B-PER
was O
not O
a B-PER
man I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
turned I-PER
aside I-PER
from I-PER
his I-PER
well-considered I-PER
scheme I-PER
, O
either O
by O
dread O
of O
the B-PER
wizard I-PER
's O
ghost O
, O
or O
by O
flimsy O
sentimentalities O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
however O
specious O
. O
Had O
he O
been O
told O
of O
a O
bad O
air O
, O
it O
might O
have O
moved O
him O
somewhat O
; O
but O
he O
was O
ready O
to O
encounter O
an O
evil O
spirit O
on O
his B-LOC
own I-LOC
ground I-LOC
. O
Endowed O
with O
commonsense O
, O
as O
massive O
and O
hard O
as O
blocks O
of O
granite O
, O
fastened O
together O
by O
stern O
rigidity O
of O
purpose O
, O
as O
with O
iron O
clamps O
, O
he O
followed O
out O
his O
original O
design O
, O
probably O
without O
so O
much O
as O
imagining O
an O
objection O
to O
it O
. O
On O
the O
score O
of O
delicacy O
, O
or O
any O
scrupulousness O
which O
a O
finer O
sensibility O
might O
have O
taught O
him O
, O
the B-PER
Colonel I-PER
, O
like O
most O
of O
his O
breed O
and O
generation O
, O
was O
impenetrable O
. O
He O
therefore O
dug O
his B-FAC
cellar I-FAC
, O
and O
laid O
the O
deep O
foundations O
of O
his B-FAC
mansion I-FAC
, O
on O
the O
square O
of O
earth O
whence O
Matthew B-PER
Maule I-PER
, O
forty O
years O
before O
, O
had O
first O
swept O
away O
the O
fallen O
leaves O
. O
It O
was O
a O
curious O
, O
and O
, O
as O
some B-PER
people I-PER
thought O
, O
an O
ominous O
fact O
, O
that O
, O
very O
soon O
after O
the B-PER
workmen I-PER
began O
their O
operations O
, O
the B-LOC
spring I-LOC
of I-LOC
water I-LOC
, I-LOC
above I-LOC
mentioned I-LOC
, O
entirely O
lost O
the O
deliciousness O
of O
its O
pristine O
quality O

Whether O
its B-LOC
sources I-LOC
were O
disturbed O
by O
the O
depth O
of O
the B-FAC
new I-FAC
cellar I-FAC
, O
or O
whatever O
subtler O
cause O
might O
lurk O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
it O
is O
certain O
that O
the O
water O
of O
Maule B-PER
's O
Well O
, O
as O
it O
continued O
to O
be O
called O
, O
grew O
hard O
and O
brackish O
. O
Even O
such O
we O
find O
it O
now O
; O
and O
any O
old O
woman O
of O
the B-FAC
neighborhood I-FAC
will O
certify O
that O
it O
is O
productive O
of O
intestinal O
mischief O
to O
those O
who O
quench O
their O
thirst O
there B-FAC
. O
The B-PER
reader I-PER
may O
deem O
it O
singular O
that O
the O
head O
carpenter O
of O
the B-FAC
new I-FAC
edifice I-FAC
was O
no O
other O
than O
the O
son O
of O
the O
very O
man O
from O
whose O
dead O
gripe O
the O
property O
of O
the B-LOC
soil I-LOC
had O
been O
wrested O
. O
Not O
improbably O
he O
was O
the B-PER
best I-PER
workman I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
time I-PER
; O
or O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the B-PER
Colonel I-PER
thought O
it O
expedient O
, O
or O
was O
impelled O
by O
some O
better O
feeling O
, O
thus O
openly O
to O
cast O
aside O
all O
animosity O
against O
the O
race O
of O
his B-PER
fallen I-PER
antagonist I-PER
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
out O
of O
keeping O
with O
the O
general O
coarseness O
and O
matter-of-fact O
character O
of O
the O
age O
, O
that O
the B-PER
son I-PER
should O
be O
willing O
to O
earn O
an O
honest O
penny O
, O
or O
, O
rather O
, O
a O
weighty O
amount O
of O
sterling O
pounds O
, O
from O
the O
purse O
of O
his B-PER
father I-PER
's O
deadly O
enemy O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
Thomas B-PER
Maule I-PER
became O
the O
architect O
of O
the B-FAC
House I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
Seven I-FAC
Gables I-FAC
, O
and O
performed O
his O
duty O
so O
faithfully O

CHAPTER O
I O
ON O
THE O
ARIZONA B-GPE
HILLS O
I O
am O
a B-PER
very I-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
; O
how O
old O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O
Possibly O
I O
am O
a O
hundred O
, O
possibly O
more O
; O
but O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
because O
I O
have O
never O
aged O
as O
other B-PER
men I-PER
, O
nor O
do O
I O
remember O
any O
childhood O
. O
So O
far O
as O
I O
can O
recollect O
I O
have O
always O
been O
a B-PER
man I-PER
, O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
about I-PER
thirty I-PER
. O
I O
appear O
today O
as O
I O
did O
forty O
years O
and O
more O
ago O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
can O
not O
go O
on O
living O
forever O
; O
that O
some O
day O
I O
shall O
die O
the O
real O
death O
from O
which O
there O
is O
no O
resurrection O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
why O
I O
should O
fear O
death O
, O
I O
who O
have O
died O
twice O
and O
am O
still O
alive O
; O
but O
yet O
I O
have O
the O
same O
horror O
of O
it O
as O
you O
who O
have O
never O
died O
, O
and O
it O
is O
because O
of O
this O
terror O
of O
death O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
that O
I O
am O
so O
convinced O
of O
my O
mortality O
. O
And O
because O
of O
this O
conviction O
I O
have O
determined O
to O
write O
down O
the O
story O
of O
the O
interesting O
periods O
of O
my O

I O
can O
not O
explain O
the O
phenomena O

I O
can O
only O
set O
down O
here O
in O
the O
words O
of O
an B-PER
ordinary I-PER
soldier I-PER
of I-PER
fortune I-PER
a O
chronicle O
of O
the O
strange O

that O
befell O
me O
during O
the O
ten O
years O
that O
my B-PER
dead I-PER
body I-PER
lay O
undiscovered O
in O
an O
Arizona B-GPE
cave O

I O
have O
never O
told O
this O
story O

nor O
shall O
mortal B-PER
man I-PER
see O
this O
manuscript O
until O
after O
I O
have O
passed O
over O
for O
eternity O
. O
I O
know O
that O
the B-PER
average I-PER
human I-PER
mind O
will O
not O
believe O
what O
it O
can O
not O
grasp O
, O
and O
so O
I O
do O
not O
purpose O
being O
pilloried O
by O
the B-PER
public I-PER
, O
the B-PER
pulpit I-PER
, O
and O
the B-PER
press I-PER
, O
and O
held O
up O
as O
a B-PER
colossal I-PER
liar I-PER
when O
I O
am O
but O
telling O
the O
simple O
truths O
which O
some O
day O
science O
will O
substantiate O
. O
Possibly O
the O
suggestions O
which O
I O
gained O
upon O
Mars B-LOC

and O
the O
knowledge O
which O
I O
can O
set O
down O
in O
this O
chronicle O
, O
will O
aid O
in O
an O
earlier O
understanding O
of O
the O
mysteries O
of O
our B-LOC
sister I-LOC
planet I-LOC
; O
mysteries O
to O
you O
, O
but O
no O
longer O
mysteries O
to O
me O
. O
My O
name O
is O
John B-PER
Carter I-PER
; O
I O
am O
better O
known O
as O
Captain B-PER
Jack O
Carter O
of O
Virginia B-GPE
. O
At O
the O
close O
of O
the O
Civil O
War O
I O
found O
myself O
possessed O
of O
several O
hundred O
thousand O
dollars O
( O
Confederate O
) O
and O
a B-PER
captain I-PER
's O
commission O
in O
the O
cavalry O
arm O
of O
an B-ORG
army I-ORG
which I-ORG
no I-ORG
longer I-ORG
existed I-ORG
; O
the O
servant O
of O
a O
state O
which O
had O
vanished O
with O
the O
hopes O
of O
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
. O
Masterless O
, O
penniless O
, O
and O
with O
my O
only O
means O
of O
livelihood O
, O
fighting O
, O
gone O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
work O
my O
way O
to O
the O
southwest O
and O
attempt O
to O
retrieve O
my O
fallen O
fortunes O
in O
a O
search O
for O
gold O
. O
I O
spent O
nearly O
a O
year O
prospecting O
in O
company O
with O
another B-PER
Confederate I-PER
officer I-PER
, O
Captain B-PER
James O
K. O
Powell O
of O
Richmond B-GPE
. O
We O
were O
extremely O
fortunate O
, O
for O
late O
in O
the O
winter O
of O
1865 O
, O
after O
many O
hardships O
and O
privations O
, O
we O
located O
the B-LOC
most I-LOC
remarkable I-LOC
gold-bearing I-LOC
quartz I-LOC
vein I-LOC
that O
our O
wildest O
dreams O
had O
ever O
pictured O
. O
Powell B-PER
, O
who O
was O
a B-PER
mining I-PER
engineer I-PER
by I-PER
education I-PER
, O
stated O
that O
we O
had O
uncovered O
over O
a O
million O
dollars O
worth O
of O
ore O
in O
a O
trifle O
over O
three O
months O
. O
As O
our O
equipment O
was O
crude O
in O
the O
extreme O
we O
decided O
that O
one O
of O
us O
must O
return O
to O
civilization B-GPE
, O
purchase O
the O
necessary O
machinery O
and O
return O
with O
a O
sufficient O
force O
of O
men B-PER
properly O
to O
work O
the B-FAC
mine I-FAC
. O
As O
Powell B-PER
was O
familiar O
with O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
as O
well O
as O
with O
the O
mechanical O
requirements O
of O
mining O
we O
determined O
that O
it O
would O
be O
best O
for O
him O
to O
make O
the O
trip O
. O
It O
was O
agreed O
that O
I O
was O
to O
hold O
down O
our O
claim O
against O
the O
remote O
possibility O
of O
its O
being O
jumped O
by O
some B-PER
wandering I-PER
prospector I-PER
. O
On O
March O
3 O
, O
1866 O
, O
Powell B-PER
and O
I O
packed O
his O
provisions O
on O
two O
of O
our O
burros O
, O
and O
bidding O
me O
good-bye O
he O
mounted O
his O
horse O
, O
and O
started O
down O
the B-LOC
mountainside I-LOC
toward O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
, O
across O
which O
led O
the O
first O
stage O
of O
his O
journey O
. O
The O
morning O
of O
Powell B-PER
's O
departure O
was O
, O
like O
nearly O
all O
Arizona B-GPE
mornings O
, O
clear O
and O
beautiful O
; O
I O
could O
see O
him O
and O
his O
little O
pack O
animals O
picking O
their O
way O
down O
the B-LOC
mountainside I-LOC
toward O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
, O
and O
all O
during O
the O
morning O
I O
would O
catch O
occasional O
glimpses O
of O
them O
as O
they O
topped O
a O
hog O
back O
or O
came O
out O
upon O
a B-LOC
level I-LOC
plateau I-LOC
. O
My O
last O
sight O
of O
Powell B-PER
was O
about O
three O
in O
the O
afternoon O
as O
he O
entered O
the O
shadows O
of O
the O
range O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
. O
Some O
half O
hour O
later O
I O
happened O
to O
glance O
casually O
across O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
and O
was O
much O
surprised O
to O
note O
three O
little O
dots O
in O
about O
the O
same O
place O
I O
had O
last O
seen O
my B-PER
friend I-PER
and O
his O
two O
pack O
animals O
. O
I O
am O
not O
given O
to O
needless O
worrying O
, O
but O
the O
more O
I O
tried O
to O
convince O
myself O
that O
all O
was O
well O
with O
Powell B-PER
, O
and O
that O
the O
dots O
I O
had O
seen O
on O
his O
trail O
were O
antelope O
or O
wild O
horses O
, O
the O
less O
I O
was O
able O
to O
assure O
myself O
. O
Since O
we O
had O
entered O
the B-PER
territory I-PER
we O
had O
not O
seen O
a B-PER
hostile I-PER
Indian I-PER
, O
and O
we O
had O
, O
therefore O
, O
become O
careless O
in O
the O
extreme O
, O
and O
were O
wont O
to O
ridicule O
the O
stories O
we O
had O
heard O
of O
the O
great O
numbers O
of O
these O
vicious O
marauders O
that O
were O
supposed O
to O
haunt O
the O
trails O
, O
taking O
their O
toll O
in O
lives O
and O
torture O
of O
every B-PER
white I-PER
party I-PER
which I-PER
fell I-PER
into I-PER
their I-PER
merciless I-PER
clutches I-PER
. O
Powell B-PER
, O
I O
knew O
, O
was O
well O
armed O
and O
, O
further O
, O
an O
experienced O
Indian B-PER
fighter O
; O
but O
I O
too O
had O
lived O
and O
fought O
for O
years O
among O
the O
Sioux O
in O
the B-LOC
North I-LOC
, O
and O
I O
knew O
that O
his O
chances O
were O
small O
against O
a O
party O
of O
cunning B-PER
trailing I-PER
Apaches I-PER
. O
Finally O
I O
could O
endure O
the O
suspense O
no O
longer O
, O
and O
, O
arming O
myself O
with O
my O
two O
Colt O
revolvers O
and O
a O
carbine O
, O
I O
strapped O
two O
belts O
of O
cartridges O
about O
me O
and O
catching O
my O
saddle O
horse O
, O
started O
down O
the O
trail O
taken O
by O
Powell B-PER
in O
the O
morning O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
reached O
comparatively O
level O
ground O
I O
urged O
my O
mount O
into O
a O
canter O
and O
continued O
this O
, O
where O
the O
going O
permitted O
, O
until O
, O
close O
upon O
dusk O
, O
I O
discovered O
the O
point O
where O
other O
tracks O
joined O
those O
of O
Powell B-PER
. O
They O
were O
the O
tracks O
of O
unshod O
ponies O
, O
three O
of O
them O
, O
and O
the O
ponies O
had O
been O
galloping O
. O
I O
followed O
rapidly O
until O
, O
darkness O
shutting O
down O
, O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
await O
the O
rising O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
and O
given O
an O
opportunity O
to O
speculate O
on O
the O
question O
of O
the O
wisdom O
of O
my O
chase O
. O
Possibly O
I O
had O
conjured O
up O
impossible O
dangers O
, O
like O
some B-PER
nervous I-PER
old I-PER
housewife I-PER
, O
and O
when O
I O
should O
catch O
up O
with O
Powell B-PER
would O
get O
a O
good O
laugh O
for O
my O
pains O
. O
However O
, O
I O
am O
not O
prone O
to O
sensitiveness O
, O
and O
the O
following O
of O
a O
sense O
of O
duty O
, O
wherever O
it O
may O
lead O
, O
has O
always O
been O
a O
kind O
of O
fetich O
with O
me O
throughout O
my O
life O
; O
which O
may O
account O
for O
the O
honors O
bestowed O
upon O
me O
by O
three O
republics O
and O
the O
decorations O
and O
friendships O
of O
an B-PER
old I-PER
and I-PER
powerful I-PER
emperor I-PER
and O
several B-PER
lesser I-PER
kings I-PER
, I-PER
in I-PER
whose I-PER
service I-PER
my I-PER
sword I-PER
has I-PER
been I-PER
red I-PER
many I-PER
a I-PER
time I-PER
. O
About O
nine O
o'clock O
the O
moon O
was O
sufficiently O
bright O
for O
me O
to O
proceed O
on O
my O
way O
and O
I O
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
following O
the B-FAC
trail I-FAC
at O
a O
fast O
walk O
, O
and O
in O
some O
places O
at O
a O
brisk O
trot O
until O
, O
about O
midnight O
, O
I O
reached O
the O
water O
hole O
where O
Powell B-PER
had O
expected O
to O
camp O
. O
I O
came O
upon O
the B-LOC
spot I-LOC
unexpectedly O
, O
finding O
it O
entirely O
deserted O
, O
with O
no O
signs O
of O
having O
been O
recently O
occupied O
as O
a B-FAC
camp I-FAC
. O
I O
was O
interested O
to O
note O
that O
the O
tracks O
of O
the B-PER
pursuing I-PER
horsemen I-PER
, I-PER
for I-PER
such I-PER
I I-PER
was I-PER
now I-PER
convinced I-PER
they I-PER
must I-PER
be I-PER
, O
continued O
after O
Powell B-PER
with O
only O
a O
brief O
stop O
at O
the B-LOC
hole I-LOC
for I-LOC
water I-LOC
; O
and O
always O
at O
the O
same O
rate O
of O
speed O
as O
his O
. O
I O
was O
positive O
now O
that O
the B-PER
trailers I-PER
were O
Apaches B-PER
and O
that O
they O
wished O
to O
capture O
Powell B-PER
alive O
for O
the O
fiendish O
pleasure O
of O
the O
torture O
, O
so O
I O
urged O
my O
horse O
onward O
at O
a O
most O
dangerous O
pace O
, O
hoping O
against O
hope O
that O
I O
would O
catch O
up O
with O
the B-PER
red I-PER
rascals I-PER
before O
they O
attacked O
him O
. O
Further O
speculation O
was O
suddenly O
cut O
short O
by O
the O
faint O
report O
of O
two O
shots O
far O
ahead O
of O
me O
. O
I O
knew O
that O
Powell B-PER
would O
need O
me O
now O
if O
ever O
, O
and O
I O
instantly O
urged O
my O
horse O
to O
his O
topmost O
speed O
up O
the O
narrow O
and O
difficult O
mountain B-LOC
trail O
. O
I O
had O
forged O
ahead O
for O
perhaps O
a O
mile O
or O
more O
without O
hearing O
further O
sounds O
, O
when O
the B-FAC
trail I-FAC
suddenly O
debouched O
onto O
a O
small O
, O
open O
plateau O
near O
the O
summit O
of O
the B-LOC
pass I-LOC
. O
I O
had O
passed O
through O
a B-LOC
narrow I-LOC
, I-LOC
overhanging I-LOC
gorge I-LOC
just O
before O
entering O
suddenly O
upon O
this B-LOC
table I-LOC
land I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
sight O
which O
met O
my O
eyes O
filled O
me O
with O
consternation O
and O
dismay O
. O
The B-LOC
little I-LOC
stretch I-LOC
of I-LOC
level I-LOC
land I-LOC
was O
white O
with O
Indian B-FAC
tepees I-FAC
, O
and O
there O
were O
probably O
half B-PER
a I-PER
thousand I-PER
red I-PER
warriors I-PER
clustered O
around O
some O
object O
near O
the O
center O
of O
the B-FAC
camp I-FAC
. O
Their O
attention O
was O
so O
wholly O
riveted O
to O
this O
point O
of O
interest O
that O
they O
did O
not O
notice O
me O
, O
and O
I O
easily O
could O
have O
turned O
back O
into O
the O
dark O
recesses O
of O
the B-LOC
gorge I-LOC
and O
made O
my O
escape O
with O
perfect O
safety O
. O
The O
fact O
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
thought O
did O
not O
occur O
to O
me O
until O
the O
following O
day O
removes O
any O
possible O
right O
to O
a O
claim O
to O
heroism O
to O
which O
the O
narration O
of O
this O
episode O
might O
possibly O
otherwise O
entitle O
me O
. O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
made O
of O
the O
stuff O
which O
constitutes O
heroes B-PER
, O
because O
, O
in O
all O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
instances O
that O
my O
voluntary O
acts O
have O
placed O
me O
face O
to O
face O
with O
death O
, O
I O
can O
not O
recall O
a O
single O
one O
where O
any O
alternative O
step O
to O
that O
I O
took O
occurred O
to O
me O
until O
many O
hours O
later O
. O
My O
mind O
is O
evidently O
so O
constituted O
that O
I O
am O
subconsciously O
forced O
into O
the O
path O
of O
duty O
without O
recourse O
to O
tiresome O
mental O
processes O
. O
However O
that O
may O
be O
, O
I O
have O
never O
regretted O
that O
cowardice O
is O
not O
optional O
with O
me O
. O
In O
this O
instance O
I O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
positive O
that O
Powell B-PER
was O
the B-PER
center I-PER
of I-PER
attraction I-PER
, O
but O
whether O
I O
thought O
or O
acted O
first O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
but O
within O
an O
instant O
from O
the O
moment O
the O
scene O
broke O
upon O
my O
view O
I O
had O
whipped O
out O
my O
revolvers O
and O
was O
charging O
down O
upon O
the O
entire O
army O
of O
warriors B-PER
, O
shooting O
rapidly O
, O
and O
whooping O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
lungs O
. O
Singlehanded O
, O
I O
could O
not O
have O
pursued O
better O
tactics O
, O
for O
the O
red O
men O
, O
convinced O
by O
sudden O
surprise O
that O
not O
less O
than O
a O
regiment O
of O
regulars B-PER
was O
upon O
them O
, O
turned O
and O
fled O
in O
every O
direction O
for O
their O
bows O
, O
arrows O
, O
and O
rifles O
. O
The O
view O
which O
their O
hurried O
routing O
disclosed O
filled O
me O
with O
apprehension O
and O
with O
rage O
. O
Under O
the O
clear O
rays O
of O
the O
Arizona B-GPE
moon O
lay O
Powell B-PER
, O
his O
body O
fairly O
bristling O
with O
the O
hostile O
arrows O
of O
the B-PER
braves I-PER
. O
That O
he O
was O
already O
dead O
I O
could O
not O
but O
be O
convinced O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
his B-PER
body I-PER
from O
mutilation O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
the B-PER
Apaches I-PER
as O
quickly O
as O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
the B-PER
man I-PER
himself I-PER
from O
death O
. O
Riding O
close O
to O
him O
I O
reached O
down O
from O
the O
saddle O
, O
and O
grasping O
his O
cartridge O
belt O
drew O
him O
up O
across O
the O
withers O
of O
my O
mount O
. O
A O
backward O
glance O
convinced O
me O
that O
to O
return O
by O
the O
way O
I O
had O
come O
would O
be O
more O
hazardous O
than O
to O
continue O
across O
the B-LOC
plateau I-LOC
, O
so O
, O
putting O
spurs O
to O
my O
poor O
beast O
, O
I O
made O
a O
dash O
for O
the O
opening O
to O
the O
pass O
which O
I O
could O
distinguish O
on O
the O
far O
side O
of O
the B-LOC
table I-LOC
land I-LOC
. O
I O
A O
STRANGER O
FROM O
SOUTH B-GPE
CAROLINA I-GPE
Time O
touches O
all O
things O
with O
destroying O
hand O
; O
and O
if O
he O
seem O
now O
and O
then O
to O
bestow O
the O
bloom O
of O
youth O
, O
the O
sap O
of O
spring O
, O
it O
is O
but O
a O
brief O
mockery O
, O
to O
be O
surely O
and O
swiftly O
followed O
by O
the O
wrinkles O
of O
old O
age O
, O
the O
dry O
leaves O
and O
bare O
branches O
of O
winter O
. O
And O
yet O
there O
are O
places O
where O
Time O
seems O
to O
linger O
lovingly O
long O
after O
youth O
has O
departed O
, O
and O
to O

Who O
has O
not O
known O
some B-PER
even-tempered I-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
or I-PER
woman I-PER
who I-PER
seemed I-PER
to I-PER
have I-PER
drunk I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
fountain I-PER

youth I-PER

Who O
has O
not O
seen O
somewhere O
an B-GPE
old I-GPE
town I-GPE
that I-GPE
, I-GPE
having I-GPE
long I-GPE
since I-GPE
ceased I-GPE
to I-GPE
grow I-GPE

yet I-GPE

Some O
such O
trite O
reflection O
-- O
as O
apposite O
to O
the O
subject O
as O
most O
random O
reflections O
are O
-- O
passed O
through O
the O
mind O
of O
a O
young O
man O
who O
came O
out O
of O
the O
front O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
Patesville I-FAC
Hotel I-FAC
about O
nine O
o'clock O
one O
fine O
morning O
in O
spring O
, O
a O
few O
years O
after O
the O
Civil O
War O
, O
and O
started O
down O
Front B-FAC
Street I-FAC
toward O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
. O
Arriving O
at O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
late O
the O
previous O
evening O
, O
he O
had O
been O
driven O
up O
from O
the B-VEH
steamboat I-VEH
in O
a B-VEH
carriage I-VEH
, O
from O
which O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
distinguish O
only O
the O
shadowy O
outlines O
of O
the O
houses O
along O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
; O
so O
that O
this O
morning O
walk O
was O
his O
first O
opportunity O
to O
see O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
by O
daylight O
. O
He O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
suit O
of O
linen O
duck O
-- O
the O
day O
was O
warm O
-- O
a O
panama O
straw O
hat O
, O
and O
patent O
leather O
shoes O
. O
In O
appearance O
he O
was O
tall O
, O
dark O
, O
with O
straight O
, O
black O
, O
lustrous O
hair O
, O
and O
very O
clean-cut O
, O
high-bred O
features O
. O
When O
he O
paused O
by O
the B-PER
clerk I-PER
's O
desk O
on O
his O
way O
out O
, O
to O
light O
his O
cigar O
, O
the B-PER
day I-PER
clerk I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
just I-PER
come I-PER
on I-PER
duty I-PER
, O
glanced O
at O
the O
register O
and O
read O
the O
last O
entry O
: O
-- O

" O
The O
gentleman O
from O
South B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
, O
walking O
down O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
, O
glanced O
about O
him O
with O
an O
eager O
look O
, O
in O
which O
curiosity O
and O
affection O
were O
mingled O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
bitterness O
. O
He O
saw O
little O
that O
was O
not O
familiar O
, O
or O
that O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
in O
his O
dreams O
a O
hundred O
times O
during O
the O
past O
ten O
years O
. O
There O
had O
been O
some O
changes O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
some O
melancholy O
changes O
, O
but O
scarcely O
anything O
by O
way O
of O
addition O
or O
improvement O
to O
counterbalance O
them O
. O
Here O
and O
there O
blackened O
and O
dismantled O
walls O
marked O
the O
place O
where O
handsome B-FAC
buildings I-FAC
once O
had O
stood O
, O
for O
Sherman B-PER
's O
march O
to O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
had O
left O
its O
mark O
upon O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
. O
The B-FAC
stores I-FAC
were O
mostly O
of O
brick O
, O
two O
stories O
high O
, O
joining O
one O
another O
after O
the O
manner O
of O
cities B-GPE
. O
Some O
of O
the O
names O
on O
the O
signs O
were O
familiar O
; O
others O
, O
including O
a O
number O
of O
Jewish O
names O
, O
were O
quite O
unknown O
to O
him O
. O
A O
two O
minutes O
' O
walk O
brought O
Warwick B-PER
-- O
the O
name O
he O
had O
registered O
under O
, O
and O
as O
we O
shall O
call O
him O
-- O
to O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
, O
the O
central O
feature O
of O
Patesville B-GPE
, O
from O
both O
the O
commercial O
and O
the O
picturesque O
points O
of O
view O
. O
Standing O
foursquare O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
at O
the O
intersection O
of O
the B-FAC
two I-FAC
main I-FAC
streets I-FAC
, O
a O
" O
jog O
" O
at O
each B-FAC
street I-FAC
corner I-FAC
left O
around O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
a B-FAC
little I-FAC
public I-FAC
square I-FAC
, O
which O
at O
this O
hour O
was O
well O
occupied O
by O
carts B-VEH
and O
wagons B-VEH
from O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
and O
empty O
drays O
awaiting O
hire O
. O
Warwick B-PER
was O
unable O
to O
perceive O
much O
change O
in O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
. O
Perhaps O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
red O
brick O
, O
long O
unpainted O
, O
had O
scaled O
off O
a O
little O
more O
here O
and O
there O
. O
There O
might O
have O
been O
a O
slight O
accretion O
of O
the O
moss O
and O
lichen O
on O
the O
shingled O
roof O
. O
But O
the B-FAC
tall I-FAC
tower I-FAC
, O
with O
its O
four-faced O
clock O
, O
rose O
as O
majestically O
and O
uncompromisingly O
as O
though O
the B-LOC
land I-LOC
had O
never O
been O
subjugated O
. O
Was O
it O
so O
irreconcilable O
, O
Warwick B-PER
wondered O
, O
as O
still O
to O
peal O
out O
the O
curfew O
bell O
, O
which O
at O
nine O
o'clock O
at O
night O
had O
clamorously O
warned O
all B-PER
negroes I-PER
, O
slave O
or O
free O
, O
that O
it O
was O
unlawful O
for O
them O
to O
be O
abroad O
after O
that O
hour O
, O
under O
penalty O
of O
imprisonment O
or O
whipping O
? O
Was O
the B-PER
old I-PER
constable I-PER
, I-PER
whose I-PER
chief I-PER
business I-PER
it I-PER
had I-PER
been I-PER
to I-PER
ring I-PER
the I-PER
bell I-PER
, O
still O
alive O
and O
exercising O
the O
functions O
of O
his B-FAC
office I-FAC
, O
and O
had O
age O
lessened O
or O
increased O
the O
number O
of O
times O
that O
obliging B-PER
citizens I-PER
performed O
this O
duty O
for O
him O
during O
his O
temporary O
absences O
in O
the O
company O
of O
convivial B-PER
spirits I-PER
? O
A O
few O
moments O
later O
, O
Warwick B-PER
saw O
a B-PER
colored I-PER
policeman I-PER
in O
the B-PER
old I-PER
constable I-PER
's O
place O
-- O
a O
stronger O
reminder O
than O
even O
the B-FAC
burned I-FAC
buildings I-FAC
that O
war O
had O
left O
its O
mark O
upon O
the B-GPE
old I-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
with O
which O
Time O
had O
dealt O
so O
tenderly O
. O
The O
lower O
story O
of O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
was O
open O
on O
all O
four O
of O
its O
sides O
to O
the B-FAC
public I-FAC
square I-FAC
. O
Warwick B-PER
passed O
through O
one O
of O
the O
wide O
brick O
arches O
and O
traversed O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
with O
a O
leisurely O
step O
. O
He O
looked O
in O
vain O
into O
the O
stalls O
for O
the B-PER
butcher I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
sold I-PER
fresh I-PER
meat I-PER
twice I-PER
a I-PER
week I-PER
, I-PER
on I-PER
market I-PER
days I-PER
, O
and O
he O
felt O
a O
genuine O
thrill O
of O
pleasure O
when O
he O
recognized O
the O
red O
bandana O
turban O
of O
old O
Aunt B-PER
Lyddy O
, O
the O
ancient O
negro O
woman O
who O
had O
sold O
him O
gingerbread O
and O
fried O
fish O
, O
and O
told O
him O
weird O
tales O
of O
witchcraft O
and O
conjuration O
, O
in O
the O
old O
days O
when O
, O
as O
an B-PER
idle I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
he O
had O
loafed O
about O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
. O
He O
did O
not O
speak O
to O
her O
, O
however O
, O
or O
give O
her O
any O
sign O
of O
recognition O
. O
He O
threw O
a O
glance O
toward O
a O
certain O
corner O
where O
steps O
led O
to O
the B-FAC
town I-FAC
hall I-FAC
above I-FAC
. O
On O
this B-FAC
stairway I-FAC
he O
had O
once O
seen O
a B-PER
manacled I-PER
free I-PER
negro I-PER
shot O
while O
being O
taken O
upstairs B-FAC
for O
examination O
under O
a O
criminal O
charge O
. O
Warwick B-PER
recalled O
vividly O
how O
the O
shot O
had O
rung O
out O
. O
He O
could O
see O
again O
the O
livid O
look O
of O
terror O
on O
the B-PER
victim I-PER
's O
face O
, O
the B-PER
gathering I-PER
crowd I-PER
, O
the O
resulting O
confusion O
. O
The B-PER
murderer I-PER
, O
he O
recalled O
, O
had O
been O
tried O
and O
sentenced O
to O
imprisonment O
for O
life O
, O
but O
was O
pardoned O
by O
a B-PER
merciful I-PER
governor I-PER
after O
serving O
a O
year O
of O
his O
sentence O
. O
As O
Warwick B-PER
was O
neither O
a B-PER
prophet I-PER
nor O
the O
son O
of O
a B-PER
prophet I-PER
, O
he O
could O
not O
foresee O
that O
, O
thirty O
years O
later O
, O
even O
this O
would O
seem O
an O
excessive O
punishment O
for O
so O
slight O
a O
misdemeanor O
. O
Leaving O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
, O
Warwick B-PER
turned O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
kept O
on O
his O
course O
until O
he O
reached O
the O
next O
corner O
. O
After O
another O
turn O
to O
the O
right O
, O
a O
dozen O
paces O
brought O
him O
in O
front O
of O
a O
small O
weather-beaten O
frame O
building O
, O
from O
which O
projected O
a O
wooden O
sign-board O
bearing O
the O
inscription O
: O
-- O
ARCHIBALD B-PER
STRAIGHT I-PER
, O
LAWYER B-PER
. O
He O
turned O
the O
knob O
, O
but O
the O
door O
was O
locked O
. O
Retracing O
his O
steps O
past O
a B-FAC
vacant I-FAC
lot I-FAC
, O
the B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
entered O
a O
shop O
where O
a B-PER
colored I-PER
man I-PER
was O
employed O
in O
varnishing O
a O
coffin O
, O
which O
stood O
on O
two O
trestles O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
floor O
. O
Not O
at O
all O
impressed O
by O
the O
melancholy O
suggestiveness O
of O
his O
task O
, O
he O
was O
whistling O
a O
lively O
air O
with O
great O
gusto O
. O
Upon O
Warwick B-PER
's O
entrance O
this O
effusion O
came O
to O
a O
sudden O
end O
, O
and O
the B-PER
coffin-maker I-PER
assumed O
an O
air O
of O
professional O
gravity O
. O
" O

Warwick B-PER
left O
the B-PER
undertaker I-PER
's O
shop O
and O
retraced O
his O
steps O
until O
he O
had O
passed O
the B-PER
lawyer I-PER
's O
office O
, O
toward O
which O
he O
threw O
an O
affectionate O
glance O
. O
A O
few O
rods O
farther O
led O
him O
past O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
black I-FAC
Presbyterian I-FAC
church I-FAC
, O
with O
its O
square O
tower O
, O
embowered O
in O
a B-LOC
stately I-LOC

past O
the B-FAC
Catholic I-FAC
church I-FAC

with I-FAC
its I-FAC
many I-FAC

, O
and O
a O
painted O
wooden O
figure O
of O
St. B-PER

in O
a O
recess O
beneath O

past O

once O
the O
leading O

of O
the B-GPE

The O
street O
down O
which O
Warwick B-PER
had O
come O
intersected O
Front B-FAC
Street I-FAC
at O
a O
sharp O
angle O
in O
front O
of O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
hotel I-FAC
, O
forming O
a O
sort O
of O
flatiron O
block O
at O
the O
junction O
, O
known O
as O
Liberty B-FAC
Point I-FAC
, O
-- O
perhaps O
because O
slave B-PER
auctions O
were O
sometimes O
held O
there B-FAC
in O
the O
good O
old O
days O
. O
Just O
before O
Warwick B-PER
reached O
Liberty B-FAC
Point I-FAC
, O
a B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
came O
down O
Front B-FAC
Street I-FAC
from O
the O
direction O
of O
the B-FAC
market-house I-FAC
. O
When O
their O
paths O
converged O
, O
Warwick B-PER
kept O
on O
down O
Front B-FAC
Street I-FAC
behind O
her O
, O
it O
having O
been O
already O
his O
intention O
to O
walk O
in O
this O
direction O
. O
Warwick B-PER
's O
first O
glance O
had O
revealed O
the O
fact O
that O
the B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
was O
strikingly O
handsome O
, O
with O
a O
stately O
beauty O
seldom O
encountered O
. O
As O
he O
walked O
along O
behind O
her O
at O
a O
measured O
distance O
, O
he O
could O
not O
help O
noting O
the O
details O
that O
made O
up O
this O
pleasing O
impression O
, O
for O
his O
mind O
was O
singularly O
alive O
to O
beauty O
, O
in O
whatever O
embodiment O
. O
The B-PER
girl I-PER
's O
figure O
, O
he O
perceived O
, O
was O
admirably O
proportioned O
; O
she O
was O
evidently O
at O
the O
period O
when O
the O
angles O
of O
childhood O
were O
rounding O
into O
the O
promising O
curves O
of O
adolescence O

Her O
abundant O

I O
Emma O
Woodhouse O
, O
handsome O
, O
clever O
, O
and O
rich O
, O
with O
a B-FAC
comfortable I-FAC
home I-FAC
and O
happy O
disposition O
, O
seemed O
to O
unite O
some O
of O
the O
best O
blessings O
of O
existence O
; O
and O
had O
lived O
nearly O
twenty-one O
years O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
with O
very O
little O
to O
distress O
or O
vex O
her O
. O
She O
was O
the O
youngest O
of O
the O
two O
daughters O
of O
a B-PER
most I-PER
affectionate I-PER
, I-PER
indulgent I-PER
father I-PER
; O
and O
had O
, O
in O
consequence O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
marriage O
, O
been O
mistress O
of O
his B-FAC
house I-FAC
from O
a O
very O
early O
period O
. O
Her B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
died O
too O
long O
ago O
for O
her O
to O
have O
more O
than O
an O
indistinct O
remembrance O
of O
her O
caresses O
; O
and O
her O
place O
had O
been O
supplied O
by O
an B-PER
excellent I-PER
woman I-PER
as I-PER
governess I-PER
, O
who O
had O
fallen O
little O
short O
of O
a B-PER
mother I-PER
in O
affection O
. O
Sixteen O
years O
had O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
been O
in O
Mr. B-PER
Woodhouse O
's O
family O
, O
less O
as O
a B-PER
governess I-PER
than O
a B-PER
friend I-PER
, O
very O
fond O
of O
both B-PER
daughters I-PER
, O
but O
particularly O
of O
Emma B-PER
. O
Between O
_ O
them O
_ O
it O
was O
more O
the O
intimacy O
of O
sisters B-PER
. O
Even O
before O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
had O
ceased O
to O
hold O
the O
nominal O
office O
of O
governess B-PER
, O
the O
mildness O
of O
her O
temper O
had O
hardly O
allowed O
her O
to O
impose O
any O
restraint O
; O
and O
the O
shadow O
of O
authority O
being O
now O
long O
passed O
away O
, O
they O
had O
been O
living O
together O
as O
friend B-PER
and O
friend B-PER
very O
mutually O
attached O
, O
and O
Emma B-PER
doing O
just O
what O
she O
liked O
; O
highly O
esteeming O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
's O
judgment O
, O
but O
directed O
chiefly O
by O
her O
own O
. O
The O
real O
evils O
, O
indeed O
, O
of O
Emma B-PER
's O
situation O
were O
the O
power O
of O
having O
rather O
too O
much O
her O
own O
way O
, O
and O
a O
disposition O
to O
think O
a O
little O
too O
well O
of O
herself O
; O
these O
were O
the O
disadvantages O
which O
threatened O
alloy O
to O
her O
many O
enjoyments O
. O
The O
danger O
, O
however O
, O
was O
at O
present O
so O
unperceived O
, O
that O
they O
did O
not O
by O
any O
means O
rank O
as O
misfortunes O
with O
her O
. O
Sorrow O
came O
-- O
a O
gentle O
sorrow O
-- O
but O
not O
at O
all O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
any O
disagreeable O
consciousness O
. O
-- O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
married O
. O
It O
was O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
's O
loss O
which O
first O
brought O
grief O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
wedding-day O
of O
this B-PER
beloved I-PER
friend I-PER
that O
Emma B-PER
first O
sat O
in O
mournful O
thought O
of O
any O
continuance O
. O
The O
wedding O
over O
, O
and O
the B-PER
bride-people I-PER
gone O
, O
her B-PER
father I-PER
and O
herself O
were O
left O
to O
dine O
together O
, O
with O
no O
prospect O
of O
a B-PER
third I-PER
to O
cheer O
a O
long O
evening O
. O
Her B-PER
father I-PER
composed O
himself O
to O
sleep O
after O
dinner O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
she O
had O
then O
only O
to O
sit O
and O
think O
of O
what O
she O
had O
lost O
. O
The O
event O
had O
every O
promise O
of O
happiness O
for O
her B-PER
friend I-PER
. O
Mr. B-PER
Weston O
was O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
unexceptionable I-PER
character I-PER
, I-PER
easy I-PER
fortune I-PER
, I-PER
suitable I-PER
age I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
pleasant I-PER
manners I-PER
; O
and O
there O
was O
some O
satisfaction O
in O
considering O
with O
what O
self-denying O
, O
generous O
friendship O
she O
had O
always O
wished O
and O
promoted O
the O
match O
; O
but O
it O
was O
a O
black O
morning O
's O
work O
for O
her O
. O
The O
want O
of O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
would O
be O
felt O
every O
hour O
of O
every O
day O
. O
She O
recalled O
her O
past O
kindness O
-- O
the O
kindness O
, O
the O
affection O
of O
sixteen O
years O
-- O
how O
she O
had O
taught O
and O
how O
she O
had O
played O
with O
her O
from O
five O
years O
old O
-- O
how O
she O
had O
devoted O
all O
her O
powers O
to O
attach O
and O
amuse O
her O
in O
health O
-- O
and O
how O
nursed O
her O
through O
the O
various O
illnesses O
of O
childhood O
. O
A O
large O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
was O
owing O
here O
; O
but O
the O
intercourse O
of O
the O
last O
seven O
years O
, O
the O
equal O
footing O
and O
perfect O
unreserve O
which O
had O
soon O
followed O
Isabella B-PER
's O
marriage O
, O
on O
their O
being O
left O
to O
each O
other O
, O
was O
yet O
a O
dearer O
, O
tenderer O
recollection O
. O
She O
had O
been O
a B-PER
friend I-PER
and I-PER
companion I-PER
such I-PER
as I-PER
few I-PER
possessed I-PER
: O
intelligent O
, O
well-informed O
, O
useful O
, O
gentle O
, O
knowing O
all O
the O
ways O
of O
the B-PER
family I-PER
, O
interested O
in O
all O
its O
concerns O
, O
and O
peculiarly O
interested O
in O
herself O
, O
in O
every O
pleasure O
, O
every O
scheme O
of O
hers O
-- O
one O
to O
whom O
she O
could O
speak O
every O
thought O
as O
it O
arose O
, O
and O
who O
had O
such O
an O
affection O
for O
her O
as O
could O
never O
find O
fault O
. O
How O
was O
she O
to O
bear O
the O
change O
? O
-- O
It O
was O
true O
that O
her B-PER
friend I-PER
was O
going O
only O
half O
a O
mile O
from O
them O
; O
but O
Emma B-PER
was O
aware O
that O
great O
must O
be O
the O
difference O
between O
a B-PER
Mrs. I-PER
Weston I-PER
, O
only O
half O
a O
mile O
from O
them O
, O
and O
a B-PER
Miss I-PER
Taylor I-PER
in O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
; O
and O
with O
all O
her O
advantages O
, O
natural O
and O
domestic O
, O
she O
was O
now O
in O
great O
danger O
of O
suffering O
from O
intellectual O
solitude O
. O
She O
dearly O
loved O
her B-PER
father I-PER
, O
but O
he O
was O
no B-PER
companion I-PER
for I-PER
her I-PER
. O
He O
could O
not O
meet O
her O
in O
conversation O
, O
rational O
or O
playful O
. O
The O
evil O
of O
the O
actual O
disparity O
in O
their O
ages O
( O
and O
Mr. B-PER
Woodhouse O
had O
not O
married O
early O
) O
was O
much O
increased O
by O
his O
constitution O
and O
habits O
; O
for O
having O
been O
a B-PER
valetudinarian I-PER
all O
his O
life O
, O
without O
activity O
of O
mind O
or O
body O
, O
he O
was O
a B-PER
much I-PER
older I-PER
man I-PER
in I-PER
ways I-PER
than I-PER
in I-PER
years I-PER
; O
and O
though O
everywhere O
beloved O
for O
the O
friendliness O
of O
his O
heart O
and O
his O
amiable O
temper O
, O
his O
talents O
could O
not O
have O
recommended O
him O
at O
any O
time O
. O
Her O
sister O
, O
though O
comparatively O
but O
little O
removed O
by O
matrimony O
, O
being O
settled O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
only O
sixteen O
miles O
off O
, O
was O
much O
beyond O
her O
daily O
reach O
; O
and O
many O
a O
long O
October O
and O
November O
evening O
must O
be O
struggled O
through O
at O
Hartfield B-GPE
, O
before O
Christmas O
brought O
the O
next O
visit O
from O
Isabella B-PER
and O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
, O
and O
their B-PER
little I-PER
children I-PER
, O
to O
fill O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
and O
give O
her O
pleasant O
society O
again O
. O
Highbury B-GPE
, O
the B-GPE
large I-GPE
and I-GPE
populous I-GPE
village I-GPE
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
a B-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
to O
which O
Hartfield B-GPE
, O
in O
spite O
of O
its O
separate O
lawn O
, O
and O
shrubberies O
, O
and O
name O
, O
did O
really O
belong O
, O
afforded O
her O
no O
equals O
. O
The B-PER
Woodhouses I-PER
were O
first O
in O
consequence O
there B-GPE
. O
All O
looked O
up O
to O
them O
. O
She O
had O
many O
acquaintance O
in O
the B-GPE
place I-GPE
, O
for O
her B-PER
father I-PER
was O
universally O
civil O
, O
but O
not O
one O
among O
them O
who O
could O
be O
accepted O
in O
lieu O
of O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
for O
even O
half O
a O
day O
. O
It O
was O
a O
melancholy O
change O
; O
and O
Emma B-PER
could O
not O
but O
sigh O
over O
it O
, O
and O
wish O
for O
impossible O
things O
, O
till O
her B-PER
father I-PER
awoke O
, O
and O
made O
it O
necessary O
to O
be O
cheerful O
. O
His O
spirits O
required O
support O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
nervous I-PER
man I-PER
, O
easily O
depressed O
; O
fond O
of O
every B-PER
body I-PER
that I-PER
he I-PER
was I-PER
used I-PER
to I-PER
, O
and O
hating O
to O
part O
with O
them O
; O
hating O
change O
of O
every O
kind O
. O
Matrimony O
, O
as O
the O
origin O
of O
change O
, O
was O
always O
disagreeable O
; O
and O
he O
was O
by O
no O
means O
yet O
reconciled O
to O
his B-PER
own I-PER
daughter I-PER
's O
marrying O
, O
nor O
could O
ever O
speak O
of O
her O
but O
with O
compassion O
, O
though O
it O
had O
been O
entirely O
a O
match O
of O
affection O
, O
when O
he O
was O
now O
obliged O
to O
part O
with O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
too O
; O
and O
from O
his O
habits O
of O
gentle O
selfishness O
, O
and O
of O
being O
never O
able O
to O
suppose O
that O
other B-PER
people I-PER
could O
feel O
differently O
from O
himself O
, O
he O
was O
very O
much O
disposed O
to O
think O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
had O
done O
as O
sad O
a O
thing O
for O
herself O
as O
for O
them O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
a O
great O
deal O
happier O
if O
she O
had O
spent O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
life O
at O
Hartfield B-GPE
. O
Emma B-PER
smiled O
and O
chatted O
as O
cheerfully O
as O
she O
could O
, O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
such O
thoughts O
; O
but O
when O
tea O
came O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
him O
not O
to O
say O
exactly O
as O
he O
had O
said O
at O
dinner O
, O
“ O
Poor O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
! O
-- O
I O
wish O
she O
were O
here O
again O
. O
What O
a O
pity O
it O
is O
that O
Mr. B-PER
Weston O
ever O
thought O
of O
her O
! O

“ O
I O
can O
not O
agree O
with O
you O

such O
a B-PER
good-humoured I-PER

pleasant I-PER

excellent I-PER
man I-PER

that O
he O
thoroughly O

would O
not O

had O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
live O
with O
us O
for O
ever O
, O
and O
bear O
all O
my O
odd O

you O
may O
be O
very O
sure O

always O

Randalls B-FAC

of O
his B-PER

James B-PER

so O
obliged O
to O
you O
! O
” O
“ O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
I O
did O
think O
of O
her O

It O
was O
very O
lucky O
, O
for O
I O
would O
not O
have O
had O
poor O
James B-PER
think O
himself O
slighted O
upon O
any O
account O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
make O
a B-PER
very I-PER
good I-PER
servant I-PER
: O
she O
is O
a B-PER
civil I-PER
, I-PER
pretty-spoken I-PER
girl I-PER
; O
I O
have O
a O
great O
opinion O
of O
her O
. O
Whenever O
I O
see O
her O
, O
she O
always O
curtseys O
and O
asks O
me O
how O
I O
do O
, O
in O
a O
very O
pretty O
manner O
; O
and O
when O
you O
have O
had O
her O
here B-FAC
to O
do O
needlework O
, O
I O
observe O
she O
always O
turns O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
the O
right O
way O
and O
never O
bangs O
it O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
be O
an B-PER
excellent I-PER
servant I-PER
; O
and O
it O
will O
be O
a O
great O
comfort O
to O
poor O
Miss B-PER
Taylor O
to O
have O
somebody B-PER
about O
her O
that O
she O
is O
used O
to O
see O
. O
Whenever O
James B-PER
goes O
over O
to O
see O
his B-PER
daughter I-PER
, O
you O
know O
, O
she O
will O
be O
hearing O
of O
us O

He O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
her O
how O
we O

Emma B-PER
spared O
no O

tolerably O
through O

her O

The O

placed O

a B-PER
visitor I-PER
immediately O

walked O
in O

made O
it O

Knightley O
, O
a B-PER
sensible I-PER
man I-PER
about I-PER
seven I-PER

eight-and-thirty I-PER

was O
not O
only O
a O
very O
old O

intimate O
friend O
of O
the B-PER
family I-PER

but O
particularly O
connected O
with O
it O

as O
the O
elder O
brother O
of O
Isabella B-PER

husband O

He O
lived O
about O
a O
mile O
from O
Highbury B-GPE
, O
was O
a B-PER
frequent I-PER
visitor I-PER
, O
and O
always O
welcome O
, O
and O
at O
this O
time O
more O
welcome O
than O
usual O
, O
as O
coming O
directly O
from O
their O
mutual O
connexions O
in O
London B-GPE

He O
had O
returned O
to O
a O
late O
dinner O
, O
after O
some O
days O

now O
walked O
up O
to O
Hartfield B-GPE
to O
say O
that O
all O

Mr. B-PER

had O
a O
cheerful O

him O
good O

his O
many O
inquiries O
after O
“ O
poor B-PER

most O
satisfactorily O

When O

over O

Mr. B-PER

gratefully O
observed O

The B-VEH
_ I-VEH
Lusitania I-VEH
_ I-VEH
had O
been O
struck O
by O
two O
torpedoes O
in O
succession O
and O
was O
sinking O
rapidly O
, O
while O
the B-VEH
boats I-VEH
were O
being O
launched O
with O
all O
possible O
speed O
. O
The B-PER
women I-PER
and O
children B-PER
were O
being O
lined O
up O
awaiting O
their O
turn O
. O
Some O
still O
clung O
desperately O
to O
husbands B-PER
and O
fathers B-PER
; O
others O
clutched O
their B-PER
children I-PER
closely O
to O
their O
breasts O
. O
One B-PER
girl I-PER
stood O
alone O
, O
slightly O
apart O
from O
the O
rest O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
young O
, O
not O
more O
than O
eighteen O
. O
She O
did O
not O
seem O
afraid O
, O
and O
her O
grave O
, O
steadfast O
eyes O
looked O
straight O
ahead O
. O
“ O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O

” O
A B-PER
man I-PER
’s O
voice O
beside O
her O
made O
her O
start O
and O
turn O
. O
She O
had O
noticed O
the B-PER
speaker I-PER
more O
than O
once O
amongst O
the B-PER
first-class I-PER
passengers I-PER
. O
There O
had O
been O
a O
hint O
of O
mystery O
about O
him O
which O
had O
appealed O
to O
her O
imagination O
. O
He O
spoke O
to O
no B-PER
one I-PER
. O
If O
anyone B-PER
spoke O
to O
him O
he O
was O
quick O
to O
rebuff O
the O
overture O
. O
Also O
he O
had O
a O
nervous O
way O
of O
looking O
over O
his O
shoulder O
with O
a O
swift O
, O
suspicious O
glance O
. O
She O
noticed O
now O
that O
he O
was O
greatly O
agitated O
. O
There O
were O
beads O
of O
perspiration O
on O
his O
brow O
. O
He O
was O
evidently O
in O
a O
state O
of O
overmastering O
fear O
. O
And O
yet O
he O
did O
not O
strike O
her O
as O
the B-PER
kind I-PER
of I-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
would I-PER
be I-PER
afraid I-PER
to I-PER
meet I-PER
death I-PER
! O
“ O
Yes O
? O
” O
Her O
grave O
eyes O
met O
his O
inquiringly O
. O
He O
stood O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
desperate O
irresolution O
. O
“ O
It O
must O
be O
! O
” O
he O
muttered O
to O
himself O
. O
“ O
Yes O
-- O
it O
is O
the O
only O
way O
. O
” O
Then O
aloud O
he O
said O
abruptly O
: O
“ O
You O

American I-PER

” O
“ O
Yes O

” O
“ O

The B-PER

flushed O

“ O
I O

” O
“ O
Why O
? O
” O
“ O
Because O
of O

He O
looked O
round O

lowered O
his O
voice O
. O
“ O
I O

two I-PER

momentarily O
blocked O
the B-FAC
Dover I-FAC
Street I-FAC
Tube O
exit O
in O
doing O
so O
. O
The O
adjective O
“ O
old O

was O
misleading O

Their O
united O
ages O

totalled O
forty-five O

“ O

” O
The B-PER
girl I-PER
assenting O

they O
started O
walking O
down O
Dover B-FAC

towards O
Piccadilly B-FAC

“ O
Now O

, O
” O
said O
Tommy B-PER
, O
“ O
where O
shall O
we O
go O
? O
” O
The O
very O
faint O
anxiety O
which O
underlay O
his O
tone O
did O
not O
escape O
the O
astute O
ears O
of O
Miss B-PER
Prudence O
Cowley O
, O
known O
to O
her B-PER
intimate I-PER
friends I-PER
for O
some O
mysterious O
reason O

pounced O
at O
once O

“ O
Tommy B-PER

“ O
Not O

Tommy B-PER
unconvincingly O

“ O
Rolling O

” O
“ O
You O
always O
were O
a B-PER
shocking I-PER
liar I-PER

said O
Tuppence B-PER
severely O
, O
“ O
though O
you O
did O
once O
persuade O
Sister B-PER

“ O

And O
Tuppence B-PER
led O
the O
way O
upstairs B-FAC

The B-FAC
place I-FAC
was O
full O

and O
they O
wandered O
about O
looking O
for O
a O
table O

catching O
odds O

ends O
of O
conversation O
as O
they O
did O
so O

“ O

“ O
Funny O

murmured O
Tommy B-PER

“ O
I O
passed O
two B-PER
Johnnies I-PER
in O
the B-FAC

to-day O
talking O
about O

at O

two B-PER

rose O

collected O

Tuppence B-PER
deftly O
ensconced O
herself O
in O
one O
of O
the O
vacant O
seats O

Tommy B-PER
ordered O
tea O

buns O

Tuppence B-PER
ordered O
tea O
and O
buttered O
toast O

“ O
And O
mind O
the O
tea O
comes O
in O
separate O

she O
added O
severely O

Tommy B-PER
sat O
down O
opposite O
her O
. O
His O
bared O
head O
revealed O
a O
shock O
of O
exquisitely O
slicked-back O
red O
hair O
. O
His O
face O
was O
pleasantly O
ugly O
-- O
nondescript O
, O
yet O
unmistakably O
the O
face O
of O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
and O
a B-PER
sportsman I-PER
. O
His O
brown O
suit O
was O
well O
cut O
, O
but O
perilously O
near O
the O
end O
of O
its O
tether O
. O
They O
were O
an B-PER
essentially I-PER
modern-looking I-PER
couple I-PER
as O
they O
sat O
there O
. O
Tuppence B-PER
had O
no O
claim O
to O
beauty O
, O
but O
there O
was O
character O
and O
charm O
in O
the O
elfin O
lines O
of O
her O
little O
face O
, O
with O
its O
determined O
chin O
and O
large O
, O
wide-apart O
grey O
eyes O
that O
looked O
mistily O
out O
from O
under O
straight O
, O
black O
brows O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
small O
bright O
green O
toque O
over O
her O
black O
bobbed O
hair O
, O
and O
her O
extremely O
short O
and O
rather O
shabby O
skirt O
revealed O
a O
pair O
of O
uncommonly O
dainty O
ankles O

Her O
appearance O
presented O
a O
valiant O
attempt O

The O
tea O
came O
at O
last O

and O
Tuppence B-PER
, O
rousing O
herself O
from O
a O
fit O
of O

poured O
it O
out O

sauntered O
out O

to O
make O
remarks O
on O
the B-PER
inhabitants I-PER

as O
they O
returned O
from O

Montraville B-PER
was O
a O
Lieutenant O
in O
the B-ORG
army I-ORG
: O
Belcour B-PER
was O
his B-PER
brother I-PER
officer I-PER
: O
they O
had O
been O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
their B-PER

their O
departure O
for O
America B-GPE

and O
were O
now O
returning O
to O
Portsmouth O
, O
where O
the B-PER
troops I-PER
waited O
orders O
for O
embarkation O

They O
had O
stopped O
at O
Chichester B-GPE
to O
dine O
; O
and O
knowing O
they O
had O
sufficient O
time O
to O
reach O
the B-GPE
place I-GPE
of I-GPE
destination I-GPE
before O
dark O
, O
and O
yet O
allow O
them O
a O
walk O
, O
had O
resolved O
, O
it O
being O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
to O
take O
a O
survey O
of O
the O
Chichester B-GPE
ladies O
as O
they O
returned O
from O
their O
devotions O
. O
They O
had O
gratified O
their O
curiosity O
, O
and O
were O
preparing O
to O
return O
to O
the B-FAC
inn I-FAC
without O
honouring O
any O
of O
the B-PER
belles I-PER
with O
particular O
notice O
, O
when O
Madame B-PER
Du O
Pont O
, O
at O
the O
head O
of O
her B-FAC
school I-FAC
, O
descended O
from O
the B-FAC
church I-FAC
. O
Such O
an B-PER
assemblage I-PER
of I-PER
youth I-PER
and I-PER
innocence I-PER
naturally O
attracted O
the B-PER
young I-PER
soldiers I-PER
: O
they O
stopped O
; O
and O
, O
as O
the B-PER
little I-PER
cavalcade I-PER
passed O
, O
almost O
involuntarily O
pulled O
off O
their O
hats O
. O
A B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
elegant I-PER
girl I-PER
looked O
at O
Montraville B-PER
and O
blushed O
: O
he O
instantly O
recollected O
the O
features O
of O
Charlotte O
Temple O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
once O
seen O
and O
danced O
with O
at O
a O
ball O
at O
Portsmouth B-GPE
. O
At O
that O
time O
he O
thought O
on O
her O
only O
as O
a B-PER
very I-PER
lovely I-PER
child I-PER
, O
she O
being O
then O
only O
thirteen O
; O
but O
the O
improvement O
two O
years O
had O
made O
in O
her B-PER
person I-PER
, O
and O
the O
blush O
of O
recollection O
which O
suffused O
her O
cheeks O
as O
she O
passed O
, O
awakened O
in O
his O
bosom O
new O
and O
pleasing O
ideas O
. O
Vanity O
led O
him O
to O
think O
that O
pleasure O
at O
again O
beholding O
him O
might O
have O
occasioned O
the O
emotion O
he O
had O
witnessed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
vanity O
led O
him O
to O
wish O
to O
see O
her O
again O
. O
“ O
She O
is O
the O
sweetest O
girl O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
” O
said O
he O
, O
as O
he O
entered O
the B-FAC
inn I-FAC
. O
Belcour B-PER
stared O
. O
“ O
Did O
you O
not O
notice O
her O
? O
” O
continued O
Montraville B-PER
: O
“ O
she O
had O
on O
a O
blue O
bonnet O
, O
and O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
lovely O
eyes O
of O
the O
same O
colour O
, O
has O
contrived O
to O
make O
me O
feel O
devilish O
odd O
about O
the O
heart O
. O
” O
“ O
Pho O
, O
” O
said O
Belcour B-PER
, O
“ O
a O
musket O
ball O
from O
our B-PER
friends I-PER
, O
the B-PER
Americans I-PER
, O
may O
in O
less O
than O
two O
months O
make O
you O
feel O
worse O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
never O
think O
of O
the O
future O
, O
” O
replied O
Montraville B-PER
; O
“ O
but O
am O
determined O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
the O
present O
, O
and O
would O
willingly O
compound O
with O
any O
kind O
Familiar O
who O
would O
inform O
me O
who O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
is O
, O
and O
how O
I O
might O
be O
likely O
to O
obtain O
an O
interview O

” O
But O
no B-PER
kind I-PER
Familiar I-PER
at O
that O
time O
appearing O
, O
and O
the B-VEH
chaise I-VEH
which I-VEH
they I-VEH
had I-VEH
ordered I-VEH
, O
driving O
up O
to O
the O
door O
, O
Montraville B-PER
and O
his B-PER
companion I-PER
were O
obliged O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
Chichester B-GPE
and O
its B-PER
fair I-PER
inhabitant I-PER
, O
and O
proceed O
on O
their O
journey O
. O
But O
Charlotte B-GPE
had O
made O
too O
great O
an O
impression O
on O
his O
mind O
to O
be O
easily O
eradicated O
: O
having O
therefore O
spent O
three O
whole O
days O
in O
thinking O
on O
her O
and O
in O
endeavouring O
to O
form O
some O
plan O
for O
seeing O
her O
, O
he O
determined O
to O
set O
off O
for O
Chichester B-GPE
, O
and O
trust O
to O
chance O
either O
to O
favour O
or O
frustrate O
his O
designs O
. O
Arriving O
at O
the O
verge O
of O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
he O
dismounted O
, O
and O
sending O
the B-PER
servant I-PER
forward O
with O
the O
horses O
, O
proceeded O
toward O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
, O
where O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
an B-FAC
extensive I-FAC
pleasure I-FAC
ground I-FAC
, O
stood O
the O
mansion O
which O
contained O
the B-PER
lovely I-PER
Charlotte I-PER
Temple I-PER
. O
Montraville B-PER
leaned O
on O
a O
broken O
gate O
, O
and O
looked O
earnestly O
at O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
The O
wall O
which O
surrounded O
it O
was O
high O
, O
and O
perhaps O
the O
Argus O
’s O
who O
guarded O
the O
Hesperian O
fruit O
within O
, O
were O
more O
watchful O
than O
those O
famed O
of O
old O
. O
“‘ O
Tis O
a O
romantic O
attempt O
, O
” O
said O
he O
; O
“ O
and O
should O
I O
even O
succeed O
in O
seeing O
and O
conversing O
with O
her O
, O
it O
can O
be O
productive O
of O
no O
good O
: O
I O
must O
of O
necessity O
leave O
England B-GPE
in O
a O
few O
days O
, O
and O
probably O
may O
never O
return O
; O
why O
then O
should O
I O
endeavour O
to O
engage O
the O
affections O
of O
this B-PER
lovely I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
only O
to O
leave O
her O
a O
prey O
to O
a O
thousand O
inquietudes O
, O
of O
which O
at O
present O
she O
has O
no O
idea O
? O
I O
will O
return O
to O
Portsmouth B-GPE

think O
no O
more O
about O
her O
. O
” O
The O
evening O
now O
was O
closed O
; O
a O
serene O
stillness O
reigned O
; O
and O
the O
chaste O
Queen O
of O
Night O
with O
her O
silver O
crescent O
faintly O
illuminated O
the O
hemisphere O
. O
The O
mind O
of O
Montraville B-PER
was O
hushed O
into O
composure O
by O
the O
serenity O
of O
the O
surrounding O
objects O
. O
“ O
I O
will O
think O
on O
her O
no O
more O

” O
said O
he O
, O
and O
turned O
with O
an O
intention O
to O
leave O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
; O
but O
as O
he O
turned O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
gate O

led O
to O
the B-FAC
pleasure I-FAC
grounds I-FAC
open O
, O
and O
two B-PER
women I-PER

out O

who O
walked O
arm-in-arm O
across O
the O
field O
. O
“ O
I O
will O
at O

see O
who O
these O
are O

” O
said O
he O
. O
He O
overtook O
them O
, O
and O
giving O
them O
the O
compliments O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
begged O
leave O
to O
see O
them O
into O
the O
more O
frequented O
parts O

but O
how O
was O
he O
delighted O
, O
when O

discovered O

under O
the O
concealment O
of O
a O
large O
bonnet O

the O
face O

Charlotte B-PER

French I-PER

MR. B-PER
Temple O

son O
of O
a B-PER
nobleman I-PER

fortune I-PER

by I-PER
no I-PER

adequate I-PER
to I-PER
the I-PER
antiquity I-PER
, I-PER
grandeur I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
I I-PER
may I-PER
add I-PER
, I-PER
pride I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
family I-PER
. O
He O
saw O
his B-PER
elder I-PER
brother I-PER
made O
completely O
wretched O
by O
marrying O
a O
disagreeable O
woman O
, O
whose O
fortune O
helped O
to O
prop O
the O
sinking O
dignity O
of O
the B-PER
house I-PER
; O
and O
he O
beheld O
his B-PER
sisters I-PER
legally O
prostituted O
to O
old B-PER
, I-PER
decrepid I-PER
men I-PER
, O
whose O
titles O
gave O
them O
consequence O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC

and O
whose O
affluence O
rendered O
them O
splendidly O
miserable O
. O
“ O
I O
will O
not O
sacrifice O
internal O
happiness O
for O
outward O
shew O
, O
” O
said O
he O
: O
“ O
I O
will O
seek O
Content O
; O
and O
, O
if O
I O
find O
her O
in O
a B-FAC
cottage I-FAC

will O
embrace O
her O
with O
as O
much O
cordiality O

I O
should O
if O

on O
a O

” O
Mr. B-PER
Temple O
possessed O
a O
small O
estate O
of O
about O
five O
hundred O
pounds O
a O
year O
; O
and O
with O
that O
he O
resolved O
to O
preserve O
independence O
, O
to O
marry O
where O
the O
feelings O
of O
his O
heart O
should O
direct O
him O
, O
and O
to O
confine O
his O
expenses O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
his O
income O
. O
He O
had O
a O
heart O
open O
to O
every O
generous O
feeling O
of O
humanity O
, O
and O
a O
hand O
ready O
to O
dispense O
to O
those O
who O
wanted O
part O
of O
the O
blessings O
he O
enjoyed O
himself O
. O
As O
he O
was O
universally O
known O
to O
be O
the O
friend O
of O
the B-PER
unfortunate I-PER
, O
his O
advice O
and O
bounty O
was O
frequently O
solicited O
; O
nor O
was O
it O
seldom O
that O
he O
sought O
out O
indigent O
merit O
, O
and O
raised O
it O
from O
obscurity O
, O
confining O
his O
own O
expenses O
within O
a O
very O
narrow O
compass O
. O
“ O
You O
are O
a B-PER
benevolent I-PER
fellow I-PER

” O
said O
a B-PER
young I-PER
officer I-PER
to O
him O
one O
day O
; O
“ O

I O

an B-PER
angel I-PER
with O
him O

comforts O

supports O
him O
, O
he O
must O
long O
since O
have O
sunk O
under O
his O
misfortunes O

” O
The B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
’s O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
proceed O
; O
and O
Temple B-PER
, O
unwilling O
to O
irritate O
his O
feelings O
by O
making O
further O
enquiries O
, O
followed O
him O
in O
silence O
, O
til O
they O
arrived O
at O
the B-FAC
Fleet I-FAC
prison I-FAC
. O
The B-PER
officer I-PER
enquired O
for O
Captain B-PER
Eldridge O
: O
a B-PER
person I-PER
led O
them O
up O
several B-FAC
pair I-FAC
of I-FAC
dirty I-FAC
stairs I-FAC
, O
and O
pointing O
to O
a O
door O
which O
led O
to O
a B-FAC
miserable I-FAC
, I-FAC
small I-FAC
apartment I-FAC
, O
said O
that O
was O
the B-PER
Captain I-PER
’s O
room O
, O
and O
retired O
. O
The B-PER
officer I-PER
, I-PER
whose I-PER
name I-PER
was I-PER
Blakeney I-PER
, O
tapped O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
was O
bid O
to O
enter O
by O
a O
voice O
melodiously O
soft O
. O
He O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
discovered O
to O
Temple B-PER
a O
scene O
which O
rivetted O
him O
to O
the O
spot O
with O
astonishment O
. O
The B-FAC
apartment I-FAC
, O
though O
small O
, O
and O
bearing O
strong O
marks O
of O
poverty O
, O
was O
neat O
in O
the O
extreme O
. O
In O
an O
arm-chair O
, O
his O
head O
reclined O
upon O
his O
hand O
, O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
a O
book O
which O
lay O
open O
before O
him O
, O
sat O
an O
aged O
man O
in O
a O
Lieutenant O
’s O
uniform O
, O
which O
, O
though O
threadbare O
, O
would O
sooner O
call O
a O
blush O
of O
shame O
into O
the O
face O
of O
those B-PER
who I-PER
could I-PER
neglect I-PER
real I-PER
merit I-PER
, O
than O
cause O
the O
hectic O
of O
confusion O
to O
glow O
on O
the O
cheeks O
of O
him O
who O
wore O
it O
. O
Beside O
him O
sat O
a B-PER
lovely I-PER
creature I-PER
busied I-PER
in I-PER
painting I-PER
a I-PER
fan I-PER
mount I-PER
. O
She O
was O
fair O
as O
the O
lily O
, O
but O
sorrow O
had O
nipped O
the O
rose O
in O
her O
cheek O
before O
it O
was O
half O
blown O
. O
Her O
eyes O
were O
blue O
; O
and O
her O
hair O
, O
which O
was O
light O
brown O
, O
was O
slightly O
confined O
under O
a O
plain O
muslin O
cap O
, O
tied O
round O
with O
a O
black O
ribbon O
; O
a O
white O
linen O
gown O
and O
plain O
lawn O
handkerchief O
composed O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
dress O
; O
and O
in O
this O
simple O
attire O
, O
she O
was O
more O
irresistibly O
charming O
to O
such O
a O
heart O
as O
Temple B-PER
’s O
, O
than O
she O
would O
have O
been O
, O
if O
adorned O
with O
all O
the O
splendor O
of O
a B-PER
courtly I-PER
belle I-PER
. O
When O
they O
entered O
, O
the B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
arose O
from O
his O
seat O
, O
and O
shaking O
Blakeney B-PER
by O
the O
hand O
with O
great O
cordiality O
, O
offered O
Temple B-PER
his O
chair O
; O
and O
there O
being O
but O
three O
in O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
seated O
himself O
on O
the O
side O
of O
his O
little O
bed O
with O
evident O
composure O
. O
“ O
This O
is O
a O
strange O
place O
, O
” O
said O
he O
to O
Temple B-PER
, O
“ O
to O
receive O
visitors B-PER
of I-PER
distinction I-PER
in O
; O
but O
we O
must O
fit O
our O
feelings O
to O
our O
station O
. O
While O
I O
am O
not O
ashamed O
to O
own O
the O
cause O
which O
brought O
me O
here B-FAC
, O
why O
should O
I O
blush O
at O
my O
situation O
? O
Our O
misfortunes O
are O
not O
our O
faults O
; O
and O
were O
it O
not O
for O
that B-PER
poor I-PER
girl I-PER
-- O
” O
Here O
the B-PER
philosopher I-PER
was O
lost O
in O
the B-PER
father I-PER
. O
He O
rose O
hastily O
from O
his O
seat O
, O
and O
walking O
toward O
the O
window O
, O
wiped O
off O
a O
tear O
which O
he O
was O
afraid O
would O
tarnish O
the O
cheek O
of O
a B-PER
sailor I-PER
. O
Temple B-PER
cast O
his O
eye O
on O
Miss B-PER
Eldridge O
: O
a O
pellucid O
drop O
had O
stolen O
from O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
fallen O
upon O
a O
rose O
she O
was O
painting O
. O
It O
blotted O
and O
discoloured O
the O
flower O
. O
“‘ O
Tis O
emblematic O
, O
” O
said O
he O
mentally O
: O
“ O
the O
rose O
of O
youth O
and O
health O
soon O
fades O
when O
watered O
by O
the O
tear O
of O
affliction O
. O
” O
“ O
My B-PER
friend I-PER
Blakeney B-PER
, O
” O
said O
he O
, O
addressing O
the B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
, O
“ O
told O
me O
I O
could O
be O
of O
service O
to O
you O
: O
be O
so O
kind O
then O
, O
dear O
Sir B-PER

as O
to O
point O
out O
some O
way O
in O
which O
I O
can O
relieve O
the O

of O
your O

the O
pleasures O

” O
CHAPTER O
I O
It O
was O
a O
Sunday O
evening O
in O
October O
, O
and O
in O
common O
with O
many B-PER
other I-PER
young I-PER
ladies I-PER
of I-PER
her I-PER
class I-PER
, O
Katharine B-PER
Hilbery I-PER
was O
pouring O
out O
tea O
. O
Perhaps O
a O
fifth O
part O
of O
her O
mind O
was O
thus O
occupied O
, O
and O
the O
remaining O
parts O
leapt O
over O
the O
little O
barrier O
of O
day O
which O
interposed O
between O
Monday O
morning O
and O
this O
rather O
subdued O
moment O
, O
and O
played O
with O
the O
things O
one O
does O
voluntarily O
and O
normally O
in O
the O
daylight O
. O
But O
although O
she O
was O
silent O
, O
she O
was O
evidently O
mistress B-PER
of O
a O
situation O
which O
was O
familiar O
enough O
to O
her O
, O
and O
inclined O
to O
let O
it O
take O
its O
way O
for O
the O
six O
hundredth O
time O
, O
perhaps O
, O
without O
bringing O
into O
play O
any O
of O
her O
unoccupied O
faculties O
. O
A O
single O
glance O
was O
enough O
to O
show O
that O
Mrs. B-PER
Hilbery O
was O
so O
rich O
in O
the O
gifts O
which O
make O
tea-parties O
of O
elderly B-PER
distinguished I-PER
people I-PER
successful O
, O
that O
she O
scarcely O
needed O
any O
help O
from O
her B-PER
daughter I-PER
, O
provided O
that O
the O
tiresome O
business O
of O
teacups O
and O
bread O
and O
butter O
was O
discharged O
for O
her O
. O
Considering O
that O
the B-PER
little I-PER
party I-PER
had O
been O
seated O
round O
the O
tea-table O
for O
less O
than O
twenty O
minutes O
, O
the O
animation O
observable O
on O
their O
faces O
, O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
sound O
they O
were O
producing O
collectively O
, O
were O
very O
creditable O
to O
the B-PER
hostess I-PER
. O
It O
suddenly O
came O
into O
Katharine B-PER
’s O
mind O
that O
if O
some B-PER
one I-PER
opened O
the O
door O
at O
this O
moment O
he O
would O
think O
that O
they O
were O
enjoying O
themselves O
; O
he O
would O
think O
, O
“ O
What O
an B-FAC
extremely I-FAC
nice I-FAC
house I-FAC
to O
come O
into O
! O
” O
and O
instinctively O
she O
laughed O
, O
and O
said O
something O
to O
increase O
the O
noise O
, O
for O
the O
credit O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
presumably O
, O
since O
she O
herself O
had O
not O
been O
feeling O
exhilarated O
. O
At O
the O
very O
same O
moment O
, O
rather O
to O
her O
amusement O
, O
the O
door O
was O
flung O
open O
, O
and O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
entered O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
Katharine B-PER
, O
as O
she O
shook O
hands O
with O
him O
, O
asked O
him O
, O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
, O
“ O
Now O
, O
do O
you O
think O
we O
’re O
enjoying O
ourselves O
enormously O
? O
” O
... O
“ O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
, O
mother B-PER
, O
” O
she O
said O
aloud O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
that O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
forgotten O
his O
name O
. O
That O
fact O
was O
perceptible O
to O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
also O
, O
and O
increased O
the O
awkwardness O
which O
inevitably O
attends O
the O
entrance O
of O
a B-PER
stranger I-PER
into O
a O
room O
full O
of O
people B-PER
much I-PER
at I-PER
their I-PER
ease I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
all I-PER
launched I-PER
upon I-PER
sentences I-PER
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
as O
if O
a O
thousand O
softly O
padded O
doors O
had O
closed O
between O
him O
and O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
outside I-FAC
. O
A O
fine O
mist O
, O
the O
etherealized O
essence O
of O
the O
fog O
, O
hung O
visibly O
in O
the B-FAC
wide I-FAC
and I-FAC
rather I-FAC
empty I-FAC
space I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
, O
all O
silver O
where O
the O
candles O
were O
grouped O
on O
the B-FAC
tea-table I-FAC
, O
and O
ruddy O
again O
in O
the O
firelight O
. O
With O
the O
omnibuses O
and O
cabs O
still O
running O
in O
his O
head O
, O
and O
his O
body O
still O
tingling O
with O
his O
quick O
walk O
along O
the B-FAC
streets I-FAC
and O
in O
and O
out O
of O
traffic O
and O
foot-passengers B-PER
, O
this B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
seemed O
very O
remote O
and O
still O
; O
and O
the O
faces O
of O
the B-PER
elderly I-PER
people I-PER
were O
mellowed O
, O
at O
some O
distance O
from O
each O
other O
, O
and O
had O
a O
bloom O
on O
them O
owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
air O
in O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
was O
thickened O
by O
blue O
grains O
of O
mist O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
had O
come O
in O
as O
Mr. B-PER
Fortescue O
, O
the B-PER
eminent I-PER
novelist I-PER
, O
reached O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
very O
long O
sentence O
. O
He O
kept O
this O
suspended O
while O
the B-PER
newcomer I-PER
sat O
down O
, O
and O
Mrs. B-PER
Hilbery O
deftly O
joined O
the O
severed O
parts O
by O
leaning O
towards O
him O
and O
remarking O
: O
“ O
Now O
, O
what O
would O
you O
do O
if O
you O
were O
married O
to O
an B-PER
engineer I-PER
, O
and O
had O
to O
live O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
, O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
? O
” O
“ O
Surely O
she O
could O
learn O
Persian O
, O
” O
broke O
in O
a B-PER
thin I-PER
, I-PER
elderly I-PER
gentleman I-PER
. O
“ O
Is O
there O
no O
retired B-PER
schoolmaster I-PER
or O
man B-PER
of I-PER
letters I-PER
in O
Manchester B-FAC
with O
whom O
she O
could O
read O
Persian O
? O
” O
“ O
A B-PER
cousin I-PER
of I-PER
ours I-PER
has O
married O
and O
gone O
to O
live O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
, O
” O
Katharine B-PER
explained O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
muttered O
something O
, O
which O
was O
indeed O
all O
that O
was O
required O
of O
him O
, O
and O
the B-PER
novelist I-PER
went O
on O
where O
he O
had O
left O
off O
. O
Privately O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
cursed O
himself O
very O
sharply O
for O
having O
exchanged O
the O
freedom O
of O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
for O
this B-FAC
sophisticated I-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
, O
where O
, O
among O
other B-PER
disagreeables I-PER
, O
he O
certainly O
would O
not O
appear O
at O
his O
best O
. O
He O
glanced O
round O
him O
, O
and O
saw O
that O
, O
save O
for O
Katharine B-PER
, O
they O
were O
all O
over O
forty O
, O
the O
only O
consolation O
being O
that O
Mr. B-PER
Fortescue O
was O
a B-PER
considerable I-PER
celebrity I-PER
, O
so O
that O
to-morrow O
one O
might O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
met O
him O
. O
“ O
Have O
you O
ever O
been O
to O
Manchester B-GPE
? O
” O
he O
asked O
Katharine B-PER
. O
“ O
Never O
, O
” O
she O
replied O
. O
“ O
Why O
do O
you O
object O
to O
it O
, O
then O
? O
” O
Katharine B-PER
stirred O
her O
tea O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
speculate O
, O
so O
Denham B-PER
thought O
, O
upon O
the O
duty O
of O
filling O
somebody B-PER
else I-PER
’s O
cup O
, O
but O
she O
was O
really O
wondering O
how O
she O
was O
going O
to O
keep O
this B-PER
strange I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
in O
harmony O
with O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
. O
She O
observed O
that O
he O
was O
compressing O
his O
teacup O
, O
so O
that O
there O
was O
danger O
lest O
the O
thin O
china O
might O
cave O
inwards O
. O
She O
could O
see O
that O
he O
was O
nervous O
; O
one O
would O
expect O
a B-PER
bony I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
with O
his O
face O
slightly O
reddened O
by O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
his O
hair O
not O
altogether O
smooth O
, O
to O
be O
nervous O
in O
such O
a O
party O
. O
Further O
, O
he O
probably O
disliked O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
, O
and O
had O
come O
out O
of O
curiosity O
, O
or O
because O
her B-PER
father I-PER
had O
invited O
him O
-- O
anyhow O
, O
he O
would O
not O
be O
easily O
combined O
with O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
. O
“ O
I O
should O
think O
there O
would O
be O
no B-PER
one I-PER
to O
talk O
to O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
, O
” O
she O
replied O
at O
random O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Fortescue O
had O
been O
observing O
her O
for O
a O
moment O
or O
two O
, O
as O
novelists B-PER
are O
inclined O
to O
observe O
, O
and O
at O
this O
remark O
he O
smiled O
, O
and O
made O
it O
the O
text O
for O
a O
little O
further O
speculation O
. O
“ O
In O
spite O
of O
a O
slight O
tendency O
to O
exaggeration O
, O
Katharine B-PER
decidedly O
hits O
the O
mark O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
and O
lying O
back O
in O
his O
chair O
, O
with O
his O
opaque O
contemplative O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
ceiling O
, O
and O
the O
tips O
of O
his O
fingers O
pressed O
together O
, O
he O
depicted O
, O
first O
the O
horrors O
of O
the O
streets O
of O
Manchester B-GPE
, O
and O
then O
the B-LOC
bare I-LOC
, I-LOC
immense I-LOC
moors I-LOC
on O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
and O
then O
the B-FAC
scrubby I-FAC
little I-FAC
house I-FAC
in O
which O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
would O
live O
, O
and O
then O
the B-PER
professors I-PER
and O
the B-PER
miserable I-PER
young I-PER
students I-PER
devoted O
to O
the O
more O
strenuous O
works O
of O
our B-PER
younger I-PER
dramatists I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
would I-PER
visit I-PER
her I-PER
, O
and O
how O
her O
appearance O
would O
change O
by O
degrees O
, O
and O
how O
she O
would O
fly O
to O
London B-GPE
, O
and O
how O
Katharine B-PER
would O
have O
to O
lead O
her O
about O
, O
as O
one O
leads O
an O
eager O
dog O
on O
a O
chain O
, O
past O
rows O
of O
clamorous B-FAC
butchers I-FAC
’ I-FAC
shops I-FAC
, O
poor O
dear B-PER
creature I-PER
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Fortescue O
, O
” O
exclaimed O
Mrs. B-PER
Hilbery O
, O
as O
he O
finished O
, O
“ O
I O
had O
just O
written O
to O
say O
how O
I O

I O

find O
the O
nice O
things O
of O
London B-GPE
without O
the B-FAC
horrid I-FAC
streets I-FAC
that I-FAC
depress I-FAC
one I-FAC
so I-FAC
. O
” O
“ O
There O
is O
the B-FAC
University I-FAC
, O
” O
said O
the O
thin O
gentleman O
, O
who O
had O
previously O
insisted O
upon O
the O
existence O
of O
people B-PER
knowing I-PER
Persian I-PER
. O
“ O
I O
know O
there O
are O
moors B-PER
there B-GPE
, O
because O
I O
read O
about O
them O
in O
a O
book O
the O
other O
day O
, O
” O
said O
Katharine B-PER
. O
“ O
I O
am O
grieved O
and O
amazed O
at O
the O
ignorance O
of O
my B-PER
family I-PER
, O
” O
Mr. B-PER
Hilbery O
remarked O
. O
He O
was O
an B-PER
elderly I-PER
man I-PER
, O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
oval O
, O
hazel O
eyes O
which O
were O
rather O
bright O
for O
his O
time O
of O
life O
, O
and O
relieved O
the O
heaviness O
of O
his O
face O
. O
He O
played O
constantly O
with O
a O
little O
green O
stone O
attached O
to O
his O
watch-chain O
, O
thus O
displaying O
long O
and O
very O
sensitive O
fingers O
, O
and O
had O
a O
habit O
of O
moving O
his O
head O
hither O
and O
thither O
very O
quickly O
without O
altering O
the O
position O
of O
his O
large O
and O
rather O
corpulent O
body O
, O
so O
that O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
providing O
himself O
incessantly O
with O
food O
for O
amusement O
and O
reflection O
with O
the O
least O
possible O
expenditure O
of O
energy O
. O
One O
might O
suppose O
that O
he O
had O
passed O
the O
time O
of O
life O
when O
his O
ambitions O
were O
personal O
, O
or O
that O
he O
had O
gratified O
them O
as O
far O
as O
he O
was O
likely O
to O
do O
, O
and O
now O
employed O
his O
considerable O
acuteness O
rather O
to O
observe O
and O
reflect O
than O
to O
attain O
any O
result O
. O
Katharine B-PER
, O
so O
Denham B-PER
decided O
, O
while O
Mr. B-PER
Fortescue O
built O
up O
another O
rounded O
structure O
of O
words O
, O
had O
a O
likeness O
to O
each O
of O
her B-PER
parents I-PER
, O
but O
these O
elements O
were O
rather O
oddly O
blended O
. O
She O
had O
the O
quick O
, O
impulsive O
movements O
of O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
the O
lips O
parting O
often O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
closing O
again O
; O
and O
the O
dark O
oval O
eyes O
of O
her B-PER
father I-PER
brimming O
with O
light O
upon O
a O
basis O
of O
sadness O
, O
or O
, O
since O
she O
was O
too O
young O
to O
have O
acquired O
a O
sorrowful O
point O
of O
view O
, O
one O
might O
say O
that O
the O
basis O
was O
not O
sadness O
so O
much O
as O
a O
spirit O
given O
to O
contemplation O
and O
self-control O
. O
Judging O
by O
her O
hair O
, O
her O
coloring O
, O
and O
the O
shape O
of O
her O
features O
, O
she O
was O
striking O
, O
if O
not O
actually O
beautiful O
. O
Decision O
and O
composure O
stamped O
her O
, O
a O
combination O
of O
qualities O
that O
produced O
a O
very O
marked O
character O
, O
and O
one O
that O
was O
not O
calculated O
to O
put O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
scarcely I-PER
knew I-PER
her I-PER
, O
at O
his O
ease O
. O
For O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
, O
she O
was O
tall O
; O
her O
dress O
was O
of O
some O
quiet O
color O
, O
with O
old O
yellow-tinted O
lace O
for O
ornament O
, O
to O
which O
the O
spark O
of O
an O
ancient O
jewel O
gave O
its O
one O
red O
gleam O
. O
Denham B-PER
noticed O
that O
, O
although O
silent O
, O
she O
kept O
sufficient O
control O
of O
the O
situation O
to O
answer O
immediately O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
appealed O
to O
her O
for O
help O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
was O
obvious O
to O
him O
that O
she O
attended O
only O
with O
the O
surface O
skin O
of O
her O
mind O
. O
It O
struck O
him O
that O
her O
position O
at O
the B-FAC
tea-table I-FAC
, O
among O
all O
these B-PER
elderly I-PER
people I-PER
, O
was O
not O
without O
its O
difficulties O
, O
and O
he O
checked O
his O
inclination O
to O
find O
her O
, O
or O
her O
attitude O
, O
generally O
antipathetic O
to O
him O
. O
The O
talk O
had O
passed O
over O
Manchester B-FAC
, O
after O
dealing O
with O
it O
very O
generously O
. O
“ O
Would O
it O
be O
the O
Battle O
of O
Trafalgar O
or O
the O
Spanish O
Armada O
, O
Katharine B-PER
? O
” O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
demanded O
. O
“ O
Trafalgar O
, O
mother B-PER
. O
” O
“ O

, O
of O
course O

How O
stupid O

Another O
cup O
of O
tea O
, O
with O
a O
thin O
slice O
of O
lemon O
in O
it O
, O
and O
then O
, O
dear B-PER
Mr. I-PER
Fortescue I-PER
, O
please O
explain O
my O
absurd O
little O
puzzle O
. O
One O
ca O
n’t O
help O
believing O
gentlemen B-PER
with I-PER
Roman I-PER
noses I-PER
, O
even O
if O
one O
meets O
them O
in O
omnibuses B-VEH
. O
” O
Mr. B-PER
Hilbery O
here O
interposed O
so O
far O
as O
Denham B-PER
was O
concerned O
, O
and O
talked O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
sense O
about O
the B-PER
solicitors I-PER
’ O
profession O
, O
and O
the O
changes O
which O
he O
had O
seen O
in O
his O
lifetime O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Denham B-PER
properly O
fell O
to O
his O
lot O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
an O
article O
by O
Denham B-PER
upon O
some O
legal O
matter O
, O
published O
by O
Mr. B-PER
Hilbery O
in O
his O
Review O
, O
had O
brought O
them O
acquainted O
. O
But O
when O
a O
moment O
later O
Mrs. B-PER
Sutton O
Bailey O
was O
announced O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
her O
, O
and O
Mr. B-PER
Denham O
found O
himself O
sitting O
silent O
, O
rejecting O
possible O
things O
to O
say O
, O
beside O
Katharine B-PER
, O
who O
was O
silent O
too O
. O
Being O
much O
about O
the O
same O
age O
and O
both O
under O
thirty O
, O
they O
were O
prohibited O
from O
the O
use O
of O
a O
great O
many O
convenient O
phrases O
which O
launch O
conversation O
into O
smooth O
waters O
. O
They O
were O
further O
silenced O
by O
Katharine B-PER
’s O
rather O
malicious O
determination O
not O
to O
help O
this B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, O
in O
whose O
upright O
and O
resolute O
bearing O
she O
detected O
something O
hostile O
to O
her O
surroundings O
, O
by O
any O
of O
the O
usual O
feminine O
amenities O
. O
They O
therefore O
sat O
silent O
, O
Denham B-PER
controlling O
his O
desire O
to O
say O
something O
abrupt O
and O
explosive O
, O
which O
should O
shock O
her O
into O
life O
. O
But O
Mrs. B-PER
Hilbery O
was O
immediately O
sensitive O
to O
any O
silence O
in O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
, O
as O
of O
a O
dumb O
note O
in O
a O
sonorous O
scale O
, O
and O
leaning O
across O
the O
table O
she O
observed O
, O
in O
the O
curiously O
tentative O
detached O
manner O
which O
always O
gave O
her O
phrases O
the O
likeness O
of O
butterflies O
flaunting O
from O
one B-LOC
sunny I-LOC
spot I-LOC
to O
another O
, O
“ O

The B-FAC
wide I-FAC

All O
were O
shouting O

the B-PER
prefects I-PER
urged O
them O
on O
with O
strong O
cries O

The O
evening O
air O
was O
pale O

after O
every O

of O
the B-PER

the O
greasy O
leather O

one O
day O

Then O
Nasty B-PER
Roche I-PER

when O

Then O
Nasty B-PER
Roche I-PER

Is O
he O
a B-PER
magistrate I-PER

He O
crept O
about O
from O
point O

point O
on O
the O
fringe O
of O
his O
line O

making O
little O
runs O
now O

But O
his O
hands O
were O
bluish O

cold O

He O
kept O
his O
hands O
in O
the O
side O
pockets O

his O
belted O
grey O

That O
was O
a O
belt O
round O

And O
belt O
was O
also O
to O
give O
a B-PER
fellow I-PER
a O
belt O

One O
day O
a B-PER
fellow I-PER
said O
to O
Cantwell B-PER
: O

I O

give O
you O
such O

yourself O

That O
was O
not O
a O
nice O
expression O
. O
His B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
told O
him O
not O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
rough O
boys O
in O
the B-FAC
college I-FAC
. O
Nice B-PER
mother I-PER
! O
The O
first O
day O
in O
the O
hall O
of O
the B-FAC
castle I-FAC
when O
she O
had O
said O
goodbye O
she O
had O
put O
up O
her O
veil O
double O
to O
her O
nose O
to O
kiss O
him O
: O
and O
her O
nose O
and O
eyes O
were O
red O

But O
he O
had O
pretended O
not O
to O
see O
that O
she O
was O
going O
to O
cry O
. O
She O
was O
a B-PER
nice I-PER
mother I-PER
but O
she O
was O
not O
so O
nice O
when O
she O
cried O
. O
And O
his B-PER
father I-PER
had O
given O
him O
two O
five-shilling O
pieces O
for O
pocket O
money O
. O
And O
his B-PER
father I-PER
had O
told O
him O
if O
he O
wanted O
anything O
to O
write O
home B-FAC
to O
him O
and O
, O
whatever O
he O
did O
, O
never O
to O
peach O
on O
a B-PER
fellow I-PER
. O
Then O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
castle I-FAC
the B-PER
rector I-PER
had O
shaken O
hands O
with O
his B-PER
father I-PER

mother B-PER
, O
his O
soutane O
fluttering O
in O
the O
breeze O
, O
and O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
had O
driven O
off O
with O
his B-PER
father I-PER

mother B-PER
on O
it O
. O
They O
had O
cried O
to O
him O
from O
the O
car O

waving O
their O
hands O
: O
-- O
Goodbye O

Stephen B-PER
, O
goodbye O
! O
He O
was O
caught O
in O
the O
whirl O
of O
a O
scrimmage O
and O
, O
fearful O
of O
the O
flashing O
eyes O
and O
muddy O
boots O
, O
bent O
down O
to O
look O
through O
the O
legs O
. O
The B-PER
fellows I-PER
were O
struggling O
and O
groaning O
and O
their O
legs O
were O
rubbing O
and O
kicking O
and O
stamping O
. O
Then O
Jack B-PER
Lawton I-PER
's O
yellow O
boots O
dodged O
out O
the O
ball O
and O
all O
the O
other O
boots O
and O
legs O
ran O
after O
. O
He O
ran O
after O
them O
a O
little O
way O
and O
then O
stopped O
. O
It O
was O
useless O
to O
run O
on O
. O
Soon O
they O
would O
be O
going O
home B-FAC
for O
the O
holidays O
. O
After O
supper O
in O
the B-FAC
study I-FAC
hall I-FAC
he O
would O
change O
the O
number O
pasted O
up O
inside O
his O
desk O
from O
seventy-seven O
to O
seventy-six O
. O
It O
would O
be O
better O
to O
be O
in O
the B-FAC
study I-FAC
hall I-FAC
than O
out O
there O
in O
the O
cold O
. O
The O
sky O
was O
pale O
and O
cold O
but O
there O
were O
lights O
in O
the B-FAC
castle I-FAC
. O
He O
wondered O
from O
which O
window O
Hamilton B-PER
Rowan I-PER
had O
thrown O
his O
hat O
on O
the O
ha-ha O
and O
had O
there O
been O
flowerbeds O
at O
that O
time O
under O
the O
windows O
. O
One O
day O
when O
he O
had O
been O
called O
to O
the B-FAC
castle I-FAC
the B-PER
butler I-PER
had O
shown O
him O
the O
marks O
of O
the B-PER
soldiers I-PER
' O
slugs O
in O
the O
wood O
of O
the O
door O
and O
had O
given O
him O
a O
piece O
of O
shortbread O
that O
the B-PER
community I-PER
ate O
. O
It O
was O
nice O
and O
warm O
to O
see O
the O
lights O
in O
the B-FAC
castle I-FAC
. O
It O
was O
like O
something O
in O
a O
book O
. O
Perhaps O
Leicester B-FAC
Abbey I-FAC
was O
like O
that O
. O
And O
there O
were O
nice O
sentences O
in O
Doctor B-PER
Cornwell O
's O
Spelling O
Book O
. O
They O
were O
like O
poetry O
but O
they O
were O
only O
sentences O
to O
learn O
the O
spelling O
from O
. O
Wolsey B-PER
died O
in O
Leicester B-FAC
Abbey I-FAC
Where O
the B-PER
abbots I-PER
buried O
him O
. O
Canker O
is O
a O
disease O
of O
plants O
, O
Cancer O
one O
of O
animals O
. O
It O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
hearthrug O
before O
the O
fire O
, O
leaning O
his O
head O
upon O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
think O
on O
those O
sentences O
. O
He O
shivered O
as O
if O
he O
had O
cold O
slimy O
water O
next O
his O
skin O
. O
That O
was O
mean O
of O
Wells B-PER
to O
shoulder O
him O
into O
the O
square O
ditch O
because O
he O
would O
not O
swop O
his O
little O
snuff O
box O
for O
Wells B-PER
's O
seasoned O
hacking O
chestnut O
, O
the O
conqueror O
of O
forty O
. O
How O
cold O
and O
slimy O
the O
water O
had O
been O
! O
A B-PER
fellow I-PER
had O
once O
seen O
a O
big O
rat O
jump O
into O
the O
scum O
. O
Mother B-PER
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
fire O
with O
Dante B-PER
waiting O
for O
Brigid B-PER
to O
bring O
in O
the O
tea O
. O
She O
had O
her O
feet O
on O
the O
fender O
and O
her O
jewelly O
slippers O
were O
so O
hot O
and O
they O
had O
such O
a O
lovely O
warm O
smell O
! O
Dante B-PER
knew O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O
She O
had O
taught O
him O
where O
the B-LOC
Mozambique I-LOC
Channel I-LOC
was O
and O
what O
was O
the O
longest O
river O
in O
America B-GPE
and O
what O
was O
the O
name O
of O
the O
highest O
mountain O
in O
the B-LOC
moon I-LOC
. O
Father B-PER
Arnall O
knew O
more O
than O
Dante B-PER
because O
he O
was O
a B-PER
priest I-PER
but O
both O
his B-PER
father I-PER
and O
uncle B-PER
Charles O
said O
that O
Dante B-PER
was O
a B-PER
clever I-PER
woman I-PER
and O
a B-PER
well-read I-PER
woman I-PER
. O
And O
when O
Dante B-PER
made O
that O
noise O
after O
dinner O
and O
then O
put O
up O
her O
hand O
to O
her O
mouth O
: O
that O
was O
heartburn O
. O
A O
voice O
cried O
far O
out O
on O
the B-FAC
playground I-FAC
: O
-- O
All O
in O
! O
Then O
other O
voices O
cried O
from O
the O
lower O
and O
third O
lines O
: O
-- O
All O
in O
! O
All O
in O
! O
The B-PER
players I-PER
closed O
around O
, O
flushed O
and O
muddy O
, O
and O
he O
went O
among O
them O
, O
glad O
to O
go O
in O
. O
Rody B-PER
Kickham I-PER
held O
the O
ball O
by O
its O
greasy O
lace O
. O
A O
fellow O
asked O
him O
to O
give O
it O
one O
last O
: O
but O
he O
walked O
on O
without O
even O
answering O
the B-PER
fellow I-PER
. O
Simon B-PER
Moonan I-PER
told O
him O
not O
to O
because O
the B-PER
prefect I-PER
was O
looking O
. O
The B-PER
fellow I-PER
turned O
to O
Simon B-PER
Moonan I-PER
and O
said O
: O
-- O
We O
all O
know O
why O
you O
speak O
. O
You O
are O
McGlade B-PER
's O
suck O
. O
Suck O
was O
a O
queer O
word O
. O
The B-PER
fellow I-PER
called O
Simon B-PER
Moonan I-PER
that O
name O
because O
Simon B-PER
Moonan I-PER
used O
to O
tie O
the B-PER
prefect I-PER
's O
false O
sleeves O
behind O
his O
back O
and O
the B-PER
prefect I-PER
used O
to O
let O
on O
to O
be O
angry O
. O
But O
the O
sound O
was O
ugly O
. O
Once O
he O
had O
washed O
his O
hands O
in O
the O
lavatory O
of O
the B-FAC
Wicklow I-FAC
Hotel I-FAC
and O
his B-PER
father I-PER
pulled O
the O
stopper O
up O
by O
the O
chain O
after O
and O
the O
dirty O
water O
went O
down O
through O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
basin O
. O
And O
when O
it O
had O
all O
gone O
down O
slowly O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
basin O
had O
made O
a O
sound O
like O
that O
: O
suck O
. O
Only O
louder O
. O
To O
remember O
that O
and O
the O
white O
look O
of O
the O
lavatory O
made O
him O
feel O
cold O
and O
then O
hot O
. O
There O
were O
two O
cocks O
that O
you O
turned O
and O
water O
came O
out O
: O
cold O
and O
hot O
. O
He O
felt O
cold O
and O
then O
a O
little O
hot O
: O
and O
he O
could O
see O
the O
names O
printed O
on O
the O
cocks O
. O
That O
was O
a O
very O
queer O
thing O
. O
And O
the O
air O
in O
the B-FAC
corridor I-FAC
chilled O
him O
too O
. O
It O
was O
queer O
and O
wettish O
. O
But O
soon O
the O
gas O
would O
be O
lit O
and O
in O
burning O
it O
made O
a O
light O
noise O
like O
a O
little O
song O
. O
Always O
the O
same O
: O
and O
when O
the B-PER
fellows I-PER
stopped O
talking O
in O
the B-FAC
playroom I-FAC
you O
could O
hear O
it O
. O
It O
was O
the O
hour O
for O
sums O
. O
Father B-PER
Arnall O
wrote O
a O
hard O
sum O
on O
the O
board O
and O
then O
said O
: O
-- O
Now O
then O
, O
who O
will O
win O
? O
Go O
ahead O
, O
York O
! O
Go O
ahead O
, O
Lancaster O
! O
Stephen B-PER
tried O
his O
best O
, O
but O
the O
sum O
was O
too O
hard O
and O
he O
felt O
confused O
. O
The O
little O
silk O
badge O
with O
the O
white O
rose O
on O
it O
that O
was O
pinned O
on O
the O
breast O
of O
his O
jacket O
began O
to O
flutter O
. O
He O
was O
no O
good O
at O
sums O
, O
but O
he O
tried O
his O
best O
so O
that O
York B-GPE
might O
not O
lose O
. O
Father B-PER
Arnall O
's O
face O
looked O
very O
black O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
in O
a O
wax O
: O
he O
was O
laughing O
. O
Then O
Jack B-PER
Lawton I-PER
cracked O
his O
fingers O
and O
Father B-PER
Arnall O
looked O
at O
his O
copybook O
and O
said O
: O
-- O
Right O
. O
Bravo O
Lancaster O
! O
The O
red O
rose O
wins O
. O
Come O
on O
now O
, O
York O
! O
Forge O
ahead O
! O
Jack B-PER
Lawton I-PER
looked O
over O
from O
his O
side O
. O
The O
little O
silk O
badge O
with O
the O
red O
rose O
on O
it O
looked O
very O
rich O
because O
he O
had O
a O
blue O
sailor O
top O
on O
. O
Stephen B-PER
felt O
his O
own O
face O
red O
too O
, O
thinking O
of O
all O
the O
bets O
about O
who O
would O
get O
first O
place O
in O
elements O
, O
Jack B-PER
Lawton I-PER
or O
he O
. O
Some O
weeks O
Jack B-PER
Lawton I-PER
got O
the O
card O
for O
first O
and O
some O
weeks O
he O
got O
the O
card O
for O
first O
. O
His O
white O
silk O
badge O
fluttered O
and O
fluttered O
as O
he O
worked O
at O
the O
next O
sum O
and O
heard O
Father B-PER
Arnall O
's O
voice O
. O
Then O
all O
his O
eagerness O
passed O
away O
and O
he O
felt O
his O
face O
quite O
cool O
. O
He O
thought O
his O
face O
must O
be O
white O
because O
it O
felt O
so O
cool O
. O
He O
could O
not O
get O
out O
the O
answer O
for O
the O
sum O
but O
it O
did O
not O
matter O
. O
White O
roses O
and O
red O
roses O
: O
those O
were O
beautiful O
colours O
to O
think O
of O
. O
And O
the O
cards O
for O
first O
place O
and O
second O
place O
and O
third O
place O
were O
beautiful O
colours O
too O
: O
pink O
and O
cream O
and O
lavender O
. O
Lavender O
and O
cream O
and O
pink O
roses O
were O
beautiful O
to O
think O
of O
. O
Perhaps O
a O
wild O
rose O
might O
be O
like O
those O
colours O
and O
he O
remembered O
the O
song O
about O
the O
wild O
rose O
blossoms O
on O
the O
little O
green O
place O
. O
But O
you O
could O
not O
have O
a O
green O
rose O
. O
But O
perhaps O
somewhere B-LOC
in I-LOC
the I-LOC
world I-LOC
you O
could O

THE B-PER
SLAVE I-PER
'S O
SOCIAL O
CIRCLE O
. O
With O
the O
growing O
population O
in O
the B-GPE
Southern I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
the O
increase O
of O
mulattoes B-PER
has O
been O
very O
great O
. O
Society O
does O
not O
frown O
upon O
the O
man O
who O
sits O
with O
his B-PER
half-white I-PER
child I-PER
upon O
his O
knee O
whilst O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
stands O
, O
a B-PER
slave I-PER
, O
behind O
his O
chair O
. O
In O
nearly O
all O
the O
cities O
and O
towns O
of O
the B-GPE
Slave I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
the B-PER
real I-PER
negro I-PER
, O
or O
clear B-PER
black I-PER
, O
does O
not O
amount O
to O
more O
than O
one O
in O
four O
of O
the B-PER
slave I-PER
population I-PER
. O
This O
fact O
is O
of O
itself O
the O
best O
evidence O
of O
the O
degraded O
and O
immoral O
condition O
of O
the O
relation O
of O
master B-PER
and O
slave B-PER
. O
Throughout O
the B-GPE
Southern I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
there O
is O
a O
class O
of O
slaves B-PER
who O
, O
in O
most O
of O
the B-GPE
towns I-GPE
, O
are O
permitted O
to O
hire O
their O
time O
from O
their B-PER
owners I-PER
, O
and O
who O
are O
always O
expected O
to O
pay O
a O
high O
price O
. O
This O
class O
is O
the B-PER
mulatto I-PER
women I-PER
, O
distinguished O
for O
their O
fascinating O
beauty O
. O
The O
handsomest O
of O
these O
usually O
pay O
the O
greatest O
amount O
for O
their O
time O
. O
Many O
of O
these B-PER
women I-PER
are O
the O
favorites O
of O
men O
of O
property O
and O
standing O
, O
who O
furnish O
them O
with O
the O
means O
of O
compensating O
their B-PER
owners I-PER
, O
and O
not O
a O
few O
are O
dressed O
in O
the O
most O
extravagant O
manner O
. O
When O
we O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
fact O
that O
no O
safeguard O
is O
thrown O
around O
virtue O
, O
and O
no O
inducement O
held O
out O
to O
slave-women B-PER
to O
be O
pure O
and O
chaste O
, O
we O
will O
not O
be O
surprised O
when O
told O
that O
immorality O
and O
vice O
pervade O
the O
cities O
and O
towns O
of O
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
to O
an O
extent O
unknown O
in O
the B-GPE
Northern I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O
Indeed O
, O
many O
of O
the B-PER
slave-women I-PER
have O
no O
higher O
aspiration O
than O
that O
of O
becoming O
the O
finely-dressed O
mistress O
of O
some B-PER
white I-PER
man I-PER
. O
At O
negro O
balls O
and O
parties O
, O
this O
class O
of O
women B-PER
usually O
make O
the O
most O
splendid O
appearance O
, O
and O
are O
eagerly O
sought O
after O
in O
the O
dance O
, O
or O
to O
entertain O
in O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
or O
at O
the O
table O
. O
A O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
among O
the O
many O
slave-women O
in O
Richmond B-GPE
, O
Virginia B-GPE
, O
who O
hired O
their O
time O
of O
their B-PER
masters I-PER
, O
was O
Agnes B-PER
, O
a O
mulatto O
owned O
by O
John B-PER
Graves I-PER
, I-PER
Esq. I-PER
, O
and O
who O
might O
be O
heard O
boasting O
that O
she O
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
an B-PER
American I-PER
Senator I-PER
. O
Although O
nearly O
forty O
years O
of O
age O
at O
the O
time O
of O
which O
we O
write O
, O
Agnes B-PER
was O
still O
exceedingly O
handsome O
. O
More O
than O
half O
white O
, O
with O
long O
black O
hair O
and O
deep O
blue O
eyes O
, O
no B-PER
one I-PER
felt O
like O
disputing O
with O
her O
when O
she O
urged O
her O
claim O
to O
her O
relationship O
with O
the B-PER
Anglo-Saxon I-PER
. O
In O
her O
younger O
days O
, O
Agnes B-PER
had O
been O
a O
housekeeper O
for O
a B-PER
young I-PER
slaveholder I-PER
, O
and O
in O
sustaining O
this O
relation O
had O
become O
the O
mother O
of O
two B-PER
daughters I-PER
. O
After O
being O
cast O
aside O
by O
this B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, O
the B-PER
slave-woman I-PER
betook O
herself O
to O
the O
business O
of O
a B-PER
laundress I-PER
, O
and O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
most O
tasteful O
woman O
in O
Richmond B-GPE
at O
her O
vocation O
. O
Isabella B-PER
and O
Marion B-PER
, O
the B-PER
two I-PER
daughters I-PER
of I-PER
Agnes I-PER
, O
resided O
with O
their B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
and O
gave O
her O
what O
aid O
they O
could O
in O
her O
business O
. O
The B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
however O
, O
was O
very O
choice O
of O
her B-PER
daughters I-PER
, O
and O
would O
allow O
them O
to O
perform O
no O
labor O
that O
would O
militate O
against O
their O
lady-like O
appearance O
. O
Agnes B-PER
early O
resolved O
to O
bring O
up O
her B-PER
daughters I-PER
as O
ladies B-PER
, O
as O
she O
termed O
it O
. O
As O
the B-PER
girls I-PER
grew O
older O
, O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
to O
pay O
a O
stipulated O
price O
for O
them O
per O
month O
. O
Her O
notoriety O
as O
a B-PER
laundress I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
first I-PER
class I-PER
enabled O
her O
to O
put O
an O
extra O
charge O
upon O
the O
linen O
that O
passed O
through O
her O
hands O
; O
and O
although O
she O
imposed O
little O
or O
no O
work O
upon O
her B-PER
daughters I-PER
, O
she O
was O
enabled O
to O
live O
in O
comparative O
luxury O
and O
have O
her B-PER
daughters I-PER
dressed O
to O
attract O
attention O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
negro O
balls O
and O
parties O
. O
Although O
the O
term O
" O
negro O
ball O
" O
is O
applied O
to O
these O
gatherings O
, O
yet O
a O
large O
portion O

. O
Marion B-PER
was O
scarcely O
less O
richly O

than O
her B-PER

Henry B-PER
Linwood I-PER
paid O
great O
attention O
to O
Isabella B-PER
which O
was O
looked O
upon O

It O

Among O

plough-boys B-PER

and O
women O
with O
children B-PER

some O
of O
them O
very O

affording O

Ere O
young B-PER
Linwood I-PER
left O
the B-PER

he O
promised O
her O

would O
become O
her B-PER
purchaser I-PER
, O
and O
make O
her O
free O
and O
her B-PER

Mr. B-PER
Graves O
had O
long O
been O
considered O
not O
only O
an O
excellent O

upright O
citizen O
of O
the O
first O
standing O
among O
the B-PER
whites I-PER

but O
even B-PER
the I-PER
slaves I-PER
regarded O
him O
as O
one O
of O
the O
kindest O
of O
masters B-PER
. O
Having O
inherited O
his B-PER
slaves I-PER
with O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
property O
, O
he O
became O
possessed O
of O
them O
without O
any O
consultation O
or O
wish O
of O
his O
own O
. O
He O
would O
neither O
buy O
nor O
sell O
slaves B-PER
, O
and O
was O
exceedingly O
careful O
, O
in O
letting O
them O
out O
, O
that O
they O
did O
not O
find O
oppressive B-PER
and I-PER
tyrannical I-PER
masters I-PER
. O
No B-PER
slave I-PER
speculator I-PER
ever O
dared O
to O
cross O
the O
threshold O
of O
this O

of O
the B-LOC

He O
was O

THE O
NEGRO O
SALE O
. O
As O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
, O
the O
day O
of O
sale O
brought O
an O
usually O
large O
number O
together O
to O
compete O
for O
the O
property O
to O
be O
sold O
. O
Farmers O
, O
who O
make O
a O
business O
of O
raising O
slaves B-PER
for O
the O
market O
, O
were O
there O
, O
and O
slave-traders O
, O
who O
make O
a O
business O
of O
buying O
human O
beings O
in O
the B-GPE
slave-raising I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
taking O
them O
to O
the B-LOC
far I-LOC
South I-LOC
, O
were O
also O
in O
attendance O
. O
Men B-PER
and O
women B-PER
, O
too O
, O
who O
wished O
to O
purchase O
for O
their O
own O
use O
, O
had O
found O
their O
way O
to O
the O
slave O
sale O
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
throne O
was O
one O
who O
felt O
a O
deeper O
interest O
in O
the O
result O
of O
the O
sale O
than O
any O
other O
of O
the B-PER
bystanders I-PER
. O
This O
was O
young B-PER
Linwood I-PER
. O
True O
to O
his O
promise O
, O
he O
was O
there O
with O
a O
blank O
bank-check O
in O
his O
pocket O
, O
awaiting O
with O
impatience O
to O
enter O
the O
list O
as O
a O
bidder O
for O
the B-PER
beautiful I-PER
slave I-PER
. O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
heart-rending O
scene O
to O
witness O
the O
lamentations O
of O
these O
slaves O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
had O
grown O
up O
together O
on O
the O
old O
homestead O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Graves O
, O
and O
who O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
great O
kindness O
by O
that B-PER
gentleman I-PER
, O
during O
his O
life O
. O
Now O
they O
were O
to O
be O
separated O
, O
and O
form O
new O
relations O
and O
companions B-PER
. O
Such O
is O
the O
precarious O
condition O
of O
the B-PER
slave I-PER
. O
Even O
when O
with O
a B-PER
good I-PER
master I-PER
, O
there O
is O
no O
certainty O
of O
his O
happiness O
in O
the O
future O
. O
The B-PER
less I-PER
valuable I-PER
slaves I-PER
were O
first O
placed O
upon O
the O
auction-block O
, O
one O
after O
another O
, O
and O
sold O
to O
the B-PER
highest I-PER
bidder I-PER
. O
Husbands B-PER
and O
wives B-PER
were O
separated O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
indifference O
that O
is O
unknown O
in O
any O
other O
relation O
in O
life O
. O
Brothers B-PER
and O
sisters B-PER
were O
tom O
from O
each O
other O
, O
and O
mothers B-PER
saw O
their B-PER
children I-PER
for O
the O
last O
time O
on O
earth B-LOC
. O
It O
was O
late O
in O
the O
day O
, O
and O
when O
the O
greatest O
number O
of O
persons B-PER
were O
thought O
to O
be O
present O
, O
when O
Agnes B-PER
and O
her B-PER
daughters I-PER
were O
brought O
out O
to O
the O
place O
of O
sale O
. O
The B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
first O
put O
upon O
the O
auction-block O
, O
and O
sold O
to O
a O
noted O
negro B-PER
trader O
named O
Jennings B-PER
. O
Marion B-PER
was O
next O
ordered O
to O
ascend O
the O
stand O
, O
which O
she O
did O
with O
a O
trembling O
step O
, O
and O
was O
sold O
for O
$ O
1200 O
. O
All O
eyes O
were O
now O
turned O
on O
Isabella B-PER
, O
as O
she O
was O
led O
forward O
by O
the B-PER
auctioneer I-PER
. O
The O
appearance O
of O
the B-PER
handsome I-PER
quadroon I-PER
caused O
a O
deep O
sensation O
among O
the O
crowd O
. O
There O
she O
stood O
, O
with O
a O
skin O
as O
fair O
as O
most O
white O
women O
, O
her O
features O
as O
beautifully O
regular O
as O
any O
of O
her O
sex O
of O
pure O
Anglo-Saxon O
blood O
, O
her O
long O
black O
hair O
done O
up O
in O
the O
neatest O
manner O
, O
her O
form O
tall O
and O
graceful O
, O
and O
her O
whole O
appearance O
indicating O
one O
superior O

her O
condition O

The B-PER
auctioneer I-PER
commenced O
by O
saying O
that O
Miss B-PER

fit O
to O

the O

way O
led O
me O
through O
Baker B-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O
As O
I O
passed O
the O
well-remembered O
door O
, O
which O
must O
always O
be O
associated O
in O
my O
mind O
with O
my O
wooing O
, O
and O
with O
the O
dark O
incidents O
of O
the O
Study O
in O
Scarlet O
, O
I O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
keen O
desire O
to O
see O
Holmes B-PER
again O
, O
and O
to O
know O
how O
he O
was O
employing O
his O
extraordinary O
powers O
. O
His B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
were O
brilliantly O
lit O
, O
and O
, O
even O
as O
I O
looked O
up O
, O
I O
saw O
his B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
spare I-PER
figure I-PER
pass O
twice O
in O
a O
dark O
silhouette O
against O
the O
blind O
. O
He O
was O
pacing O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
swiftly O
, O
eagerly O
, O
with O
his O
head O
sunk O
upon O
his O
chest O
and O
his O
hands O
clasped O
behind O
him O
. O
To O
me O
, O
who O
knew O
his O
every O
mood O
and O
habit O
, O
his O
attitude O
and O
manner O
told O
their O
own O
story O
. O
He O
was O
at O
work O
again O
. O
He O
had O
risen O
out O
of O
his O
drug-created O
dreams O
and O
was O
hot O
upon O
the O
scent O
of O
some O
new O
problem O
. O
I O
rang O
the O
bell O
and O
was O
shown O
up O
to O
the B-FAC
chamber I-FAC
which I-FAC
had I-FAC
formerly I-FAC
been I-FAC
in I-FAC
part I-FAC
my I-FAC
own I-FAC
. O
His O
manner O
was O
not O
effusive O
. O
It O
seldom O
was O
; O
but O
he O
was O
glad O
, O
I O
think O
, O
to O
see O
me O
. O
With O
hardly O
a O
word O
spoken O
, O
but O
with O
a O
kindly O
eye O
, O
he O
waved O
me O
to O
an O
armchair O
, O
threw O
across O
his O
case O
of O
cigars O
, O
and O
indicated O
a O
spirit O
case O
and O
a O
gasogene O
in O
the O
corner O
. O
Then O
he O
stood O
before O
the O
fire O
and O
looked O
me O
over O
in O
his O
singular O
introspective O
fashion O
. O
" O
Wedlock O
suits O
you O
, O
" O
he O
remarked O
. O
" O
I O
think O
, O
Watson B-PER
, O
that O
you O
have O
put O
on O
seven O
and O
a O
half O
pounds O
since O
I O
saw O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Seven O
! O
" O
I O
answered O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
a O
little O
more O
. O
Just O
a O
trifle O
more O
, O
I O
fancy O
, O
Watson B-PER
. O
And O
in O
practice O
again O
, O
I O
observe O
. O
You O
did O
not O
tell O
me O
that O
you O
intended O
to O
go O
into O
harness O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
, O
how O
do O
you O
know O
? O
" O
" O
I O
see O
it O
, O
I O
deduce O
it O
. O
How O
do O
I O
know O
that O
you O
have O
been O
getting O
yourself O
very O
wet O
lately O
, O
and O
that O
you O
have O
a B-PER
most I-PER
clumsy I-PER
and I-PER
careless I-PER
servant I-PER
girl I-PER
? O
" O
" O
My B-PER
dear I-PER
Holmes B-PER
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
this O
is O
too O
much O
. O
You O
would O
certainly O
have O
been O
burned O
, O
had O
you O
lived O
a O
few O
centuries O
ago O
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
I O
had O
a O
country O
walk O
on O
Thursday O
and O
came O
home B-FAC
in O
a O
dreadful O
mess O
, O
but O
as O
I O
have O
changed O
my O
clothes O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
how O
you O
deduce O
it O
. O
As O
to O
Mary B-PER
Jane I-PER
, O
she O
is O
incorrigible O
, O
and O
my B-PER
wife I-PER
has O
given O
her O
notice O
, O
but O
there O
, O
again O
, O
I O
fail O
to O
see O
how O
you O
work O
it O
out O
. O
" O
He O
chuckled O
to O
himself O
and O
rubbed O
his O
long O
, O
nervous O
hands O
together O
. O
" O
It O
is O
simplicity O
itself O
, O
" O
said O
he O
; O
" O
my O
eyes O
tell O
me O
that O
on O
the O
inside O
of O
your O
left O
shoe O
, O
just O
where O
the O
firelight O
strikes O
it O
, O
the O
leather O
is O
scored O
by O
six O
almost O
parallel O
cuts O
. O
Obviously O
they O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
someone O
who O
has O
very O
carelessly O
scraped O
round O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
sole O
in O
order O
to O
remove O
crusted O
mud O
from O
it O
. O
Hence O
, O
you O
see O
, O
my O
double O
deduction O
that O
you O
had O
been O
out O
in O
vile O
weather O
, O
and O
that O
you O
had O
a O
particularly O
malignant O
boot-slitting O
specimen O
of O
the O
London B-GPE
slavey O
. O
As O
to O
your O
practice O
, O
if O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
walks O
into O
my B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
smelling O
of O
iodoform O
, O
with O
a O
black O
mark O
of O
nitrate O
of O
silver O
upon O
his O
right O
forefinger O
, O
and O
a O
bulge O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
his O
top-hat O
to O
show O
where O
he O
has O
secreted O
his O
stethoscope O
, O
I O
must O
be O
dull O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
I O
do O
not O
pronounce O
him O
to O
be O
an B-PER
active I-PER
member I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
medical I-PER
profession I-PER
. O
" O
I O
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
at O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
he O
explained O
his O
process O
of O
deduction O
. O
" O
When O
I O
hear O
you O
give O
your O
reasons O
, O
" O
I O
remarked O
, O
" O
the O
thing O
always O
appears O
to O
me O
to O
be O
so O
ridiculously O
simple O
that O
I O
could O
easily O
do O
it O
myself O
, O
though O
at O
each O
successive O
instance O
of O
your O
reasoning O
I O
am O
baffled O
until O
you O
explain O
your O
process O
. O
And O
yet O
I O
believe O
that O
my O
eyes O
are O
as O
good O
as O
yours O
. O
" O
" O
Quite O
so O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
lighting O
a O
cigarette O
, O
and O
throwing O
himself O
down O
into O
an O
armchair O
. O
" O
You O
see O
, O
but O
you O
do O
not O
observe O
. O
The O
distinction O
is O
clear O
. O
For O
example O
, O
you O
have O
frequently O
seen O
the O
steps O
which O
lead O
up O
from O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC

this B-FAC

" O

some O

there O

you O

is O
just O
my O
point O

Now O
, O
I O
know O
that O
there O
are O
seventeen B-FAC

because O
I O
have O
both O
seen O

threw O
over O

a B-PER

you I-PER
upon I-PER

moment I-PER

Your O
recent O
services O

shown O
that O

you O
imagine O

I O

It O
is O
a O
capital O
mistake O

But O
the O

itself O

" O
I O
carefully O

But O
at O
the B-FAC
“ I-FAC
Trois I-FAC
Couronnes I-FAC

” I-FAC
it O
must O
be O
added O
, O
there O
are O
other O
features O
that O
are O
much O
at O
variance O
with O
these O
suggestions O
: O
neat O
German O
waiters O

who O
look O
like O
secretaries B-PER
of I-PER
legation I-PER

Russian O
princesses O
sitting O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
; O
little O
Polish O
boys O
walking O
about O
held O
by O
the O
hand O

with O
their B-PER

and O
the B-FAC
picturesque I-FAC

of I-FAC
the I-FAC

. O
I O
hardly O
know O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
analogies O
or O
the O
differences O
that O
were O
uppermost O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
a O
young O
American O
, O
who O
, O
two O
or O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
sat O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
the B-FAC
“ I-FAC
Trois I-FAC
Couronnes I-FAC
, I-FAC
” I-FAC
looking O
about O
him O
, O
rather O
idly O
, O
at O
some O
of O
the O
graceful O
objects O
I O
have O
mentioned O
. O
It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
summer O
morning O
, O
and O
in O
whatever O
fashion O
the B-PER
young I-PER
American I-PER
looked O
at O
things O
, O
they O
must O
have O
seemed O
to O
him O
charming O
. O
He O
had O
come O
from O
Geneva B-GPE
the O
day O
before O
by O
the B-VEH
little I-VEH
steamer I-VEH
, O
to O
see O
his B-PER
aunt I-PER
, O
who O
was O
staying O
at O
the B-FAC
hotel I-FAC
-- O
Geneva B-GPE
having O
been O
for O
a O
long O
time O
his B-FAC
place I-FAC
of I-FAC
residence I-FAC
. O
But O
his B-PER
aunt I-PER
had O
a O
headache O
-- O
his B-PER
aunt I-PER
had O
almost O
always O
a O
headache O
-- O
and O
now O
she O
was O
shut O
up O
in O
her B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
smelling O
camphor O
, O
so O
that O
he O
was O
at O
liberty O
to O
wander O
about O
. O
He O
was O
some O
seven-and-twenty O
years O
of O
age O
; O
when O
his B-PER
friends I-PER
spoke O
of O
him O
, O
they O
usually O
said O
that O
he O
was O
at O
Geneva B-GPE
“ O
studying O
. O
” O
When O
his B-PER
enemies I-PER
spoke O
of O
him O
, O
they O
said O
-- O
but O
, O
after O
all O
, O
he O
had O
no B-PER
enemies I-PER
; O
he O
was O
an B-PER
extremely I-PER
amiable I-PER
fellow I-PER
, O
and O
universally O
liked O
. O
What O
I O
should O
say O
is O
, O
simply O
, O
that O
when O
certain B-PER
persons I-PER
spoke O
of O
him O
they O
affirmed O
that O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
spending O
so O
much O
time O
at O
Geneva B-GPE
was O
that O
he O
was O
extremely O
devoted O
to O
a O
lady O
who O
lived O
there B-GPE
-- O
a B-PER
foreign I-PER
lady I-PER
-- I-PER
a I-PER
person I-PER
older I-PER
than I-PER
himself I-PER
. O
Very B-PER
few I-PER
Americans I-PER
-- O
indeed O
, O
I O
think O
none O
-- O
had O
ever O
seen O
this B-PER
lady I-PER
, I-PER
about I-PER
whom I-PER
there I-PER
were I-PER
some I-PER
singular I-PER
stories I-PER
. O
But O
Winterbourne B-PER
had O
an O
old O
attachment O
for O
the B-GPE
little I-GPE
metropolis I-GPE
of I-GPE
Calvinism I-GPE
; O
he O
had O
been O
put O
to O
school O
there B-GPE
as O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
, O
and O
he O
had O
afterward O
gone O
to O
college B-ORG
there B-GPE
-- O
circumstances O
which O
had O
led O
to O
his O
forming O
a O
great O
many O
youthful O
friendships O
. O
Many O
of O
these O
he O
had O
kept O
, O
and O
they O
were O
a O
source O
of O
great O
satisfaction O
to O
him O
. O
After O
knocking O
at O
his B-PER
aunt I-PER
’s O
door O
and O
learning O
that O
she O
was O
indisposed O
, O
he O
had O
taken O
a O
walk O
about O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
and O
then O
he O
had O
come O
in O
to O
his O
breakfast O
. O
He O
had O
now O
finished O
his O
breakfast O
; O
but O
he O
was O
drinking O
a O
small O
cup O
of O
coffee O
, O
which O
had O
been O
served O
to O
him O
on O
a O
little O
table O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
by O
one O
of O
the O
waiters O
who O
looked O
like O
an B-PER
attache I-PER
. O
At O
last O
he O
finished O
his O
coffee O
and O
lit O
a O
cigarette O
. O
Presently O
a B-PER
small I-PER
boy I-PER
came O
walking O
along O
the O
path O
-- O
an B-PER
urchin I-PER
of I-PER
nine I-PER
or I-PER
ten I-PER
. O
The B-PER
child I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
diminutive I-PER
for I-PER
his I-PER
years I-PER
, O
had O
an O
aged O
expression O
of O
countenance O
, O
a O
pale O
complexion O
, O
and O
sharp O
little O
features O
. O
He O
was O
dressed O
in O
knickerbockers O
, O
with O
red O
stockings O
, O
which O
displayed O
his O
poor O
little O
spindle-shanks O
; O
he O
also O
wore O
a O
brilliant O
red O
cravat O
. O
He O
carried O
in O
his O
hand O
a O
long O
alpenstock O
, O
the O
sharp O
point O
of O
which O
he O
thrust O
into O
everything O
that O
he O
approached O
-- O
the O
flowerbeds O
, O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
benches O
, O
the O
trains O
of O
the B-PER
ladies I-PER
’ O
dresses O
. O
In O
front O
of O
Winterbourne B-PER
he O
paused O
, O
looking O
at O
him O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
bright O
, O
penetrating O
little O
eyes O
. O
“ O
Will O
you O
give O
me O
a O
lump O
of O
sugar O
? O
” O
he O
asked O
in O
a O
sharp O
, O
hard O
little O
voice O
-- O
a O
voice O
immature O
and O
yet O
, O
somehow O
, O
not O
young O
. O
Winterbourne B-PER
glanced O
at O
the O
small O
table O
near O
him O
, O
on O
which O
his O
coffee O
service O
rested O
, O
and O
saw O
that O
several O
morsels O
of O
sugar O
remained O
. O
“ O
Yes O
, O
you O
may O
take O
one O
, O
” O
he O
answered O
; O
“ O
but O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
sugar O
is O
good O
for O
little B-PER
boys I-PER
. O
” O
This B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
stepped O
forward O
and O
carefully O
selected O
three O
of O
the O
coveted O
fragments O
, O
two O
of O
which O
he O
buried O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
knickerbockers O
, O
depositing O
the O
other O
as O
promptly O
in O
another O
place O
. O
He O
poked O
his O
alpenstock O
, O
lance-fashion O
, O
into O
Winterbourne B-PER
’s O
bench O
and O
tried O
to O
crack O
the O
lump O
of O
sugar O
with O
his O
teeth O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
blazes O
; O
it O
’s O
har-r-d O
! O
” O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
pronouncing O
the O
adjective O
in O
a O
peculiar O
manner O
. O
Winterbourne B-PER
had O
immediately O
perceived O
that O
he O
might O
have O
the O
honor O
of O
claiming O
him O
as O
a B-PER
fellow I-PER
countryman I-PER
. O
“ O
Take O
care O
you O
do O
n’t O
hurt O
your O
teeth O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
paternally O
. O
“ O
I O
have O
n’t O
got O
any O
teeth O
to O
hurt O
. O
They O
have O
all O
come O
out O
. O
I O
have O
only O
got O
seven O
teeth O
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
counted O
them O
last O
night O
, O
and O
one O
came O
out O
right O
afterward O
. O
She O
said O
she O
’d O
slap O
me O
if O
any O
more O
came O
out O
. O
I O
ca O
n’t O
help O
it O
. O
It O
’s O
this B-GPE
old I-GPE
Europe I-GPE
. O
It O
’s O
the O
climate O
that O
makes O
them O
come O
out O
. O
In O
America B-GPE
they O
did O
n’t O
come O
out O
. O
It O
’s O
these B-FAC
hotels I-FAC
. O
” O
Winterbourne B-PER
was O
much O
amused O
. O
“ O
If O
you O
eat O
three O
lumps O
of O
sugar O
, O
your B-PER
mother I-PER
will O
certainly O
slap O
you O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
She O
’s O
got O
to O
give O
me O
some O
candy O
, O
then O
, O
” O
rejoined O
his B-PER
young I-PER
interlocutor I-PER
. O
“ O
I O
ca O
n’t O
get O
any O
candy O
here O
-- O
any O
American O
candy O
. O
American O
candy O
’s O
the O
best O
candy O
. O
” O
“ O
And O
are O
American B-PER
little I-PER
boys I-PER
the B-PER
best I-PER
little I-PER
boys I-PER
? O
” O
asked O
Winterbourne O
. O
“ O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O
I O
’m O
an B-PER
American I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
child I-PER
. O
“ O
I O
see O
you O
are O
one B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
best I-PER
! O
” O
laughed O
Winterbourne B-PER
. O
“ O
Are O
you O
an B-PER
American I-PER
man I-PER
? O
” O
pursued O
this B-PER
vivacious I-PER
infant I-PER
. O
And O
then O
, O
on O
Winterbourne B-PER
’s O
affirmative O
reply O
-- O
“ O
American B-PER
men I-PER
are O
the O
best O
, O
” O
he O
declared O
. O
His B-PER
companion I-PER
thanked O
him O
for O
the O
compliment O
, O
and O
the B-PER
child I-PER
, O
who O
had O
now O
got O
astride O
of O
his O
alpenstock O
, O
stood O
looking O
about O
him O
, O
while O
he O
attacked O
a O
second O
lump O
of O
sugar O
. O
Winterbourne B-PER
wondered O
if O
he O
himself O
had O
been O
like O
this O
in O
his O
infancy O
, O
for O
he O
had O
been O
brought O
to O
Europe B-GPE
at O
about O
this O
age O
. O
“ O
Here O
comes O
my B-PER
sister I-PER
! O
” O
cried O
the B-PER
child I-PER
in O
a O
moment O
. O
“ O
She O
’s O
an O
American B-PER
girl I-PER
. O
” O
Winterbourne B-PER
looked O
along O
the O
path O
and O
saw O
a B-PER
beautiful I-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
advancing O
. O
“ O
American B-PER
girls I-PER
are O
the B-PER
best I-PER
girls I-PER
, O
” O
he O
said O
cheerfully O
to O
his B-PER
young I-PER
companion I-PER
. O
“ O
My B-PER
sister I-PER
ai O
n’t O
the O
best O
! O
” O
the B-PER
child I-PER
declared O
. O
“ O
She O
’s O
always O
blowing O
at O
me O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
imagine O
that O
is O
your O
fault O
, O
not O
hers O
, O
” O
said O
Winterbourne B-PER
. O
The B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
meanwhile O
had O
drawn O
near O
. O
She O
was O
dressed O
in O
white O
muslin O
, O
with O
a O
hundred O
frills O
and O
flounces O
, O
and O
knots O
of O
pale-colored O
ribbon O
. O
She O
was O
bareheaded O
, O
but O
she O
balanced O
in O
her O
hand O
a O
large O
parasol O
, O
with O
a O
deep O
border O
of O
embroidery O
; O
and O
she O
was O
strikingly O
, O
admirably O
pretty O
. O
“ O
How O
pretty O
they O
are O
! O
” O
thought O
Winterbourne B-PER
, O
straightening O
himself O
in O
his O
seat O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
prepared O
to O
rise O
. O
The B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
paused O
in O
front O
of O
his O
bench O
, O
near O
the O
parapet O
of O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
which O
overlooked O
the B-LOC
lake I-LOC
. O
The B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
had O
now O
converted O
his O
alpenstock O
into O
a O
vaulting O
pole O
, O
by O
the O
aid O
of O
which O
he O
was O
springing O
about O
in O
the O
gravel O
and O
kicking O
it O
up O
not O
a O
little O
. O
“ O
Randolph B-PER
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
, O
“ O
what O
ARE O
you O
doing O
? O
” O
“ O
I O
’m O
going O
up O
the B-LOC
Alps I-LOC
, O
” O
replied O
Randolph B-PER
. O
“ O
This O
is O
the O
way O
! O
” O
And O
he O
gave O
another O
little O
jump O
, O
scattering O
the O
pebbles O
about O
Winterbourne B-PER
’s O
ears O
. O
“ O
That O
’s O
the O
way O
they O
come O
down O
, O
” O
said O
Winterbourne B-PER
. O
“ O
He O
’s O
an B-PER
American I-PER
man I-PER
! O
” O
cried O
Randolph B-PER
, O
in O
his O
little O
hard O
voice O
. O
The B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
gave O
no O
heed O
to O
this O
announcement O
, O
but O
looked O
straight O
at O
her B-PER
brother I-PER
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
I O
guess O
you O
had O
better O
be O
quiet O
, O
” O
she O
simply O
observed O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Winterbourne B-PER
that O
he O
had O
been O
in O
a O
manner O
presented O
. O
He O
got O
up O
and O
stepped O
slowly O
toward O
the B-PER
young I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
throwing O
away O
his O
cigarette O
. O
“ O
This B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
and O
I O
have O
made O
acquaintance O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
with O
great O
civility O
. O
In O
Geneva B-GPE
, O
as O
he O
had O
been O
perfectly O
aware O
, O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
was O
not O
at O
liberty O
to O
speak O
to O
a B-PER
young I-PER
unmarried I-PER
lady I-PER
except O
under O
certain O
rarely O
occurring O
conditions O
; O
but O
here B-GPE
at O
Vevey B-GPE
, O
what O
conditions O
could O
be O
better O
than O
these O
? O
-- O
a B-PER
pretty I-PER
American I-PER
girl I-PER
coming O
and O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
you O
in O
a B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
This B-PER
pretty I-PER
American I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
however O
, O
on O
hearing O
Winterbourne B-PER
’s O
observation O
, O
simply O
glanced O
at O
him O
; O
she O
then O
turned O
her O
head O
and O
looked O
over O
the B-FAC
parapet I-FAC
, O
at O
the B-LOC
lake I-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
opposite I-LOC
mountains I-LOC
. O
He O
wondered O
whether O
he O
had O
gone O
too O
far O
, O
but O
he O
decided O
that O
he O
must O
advance O
farther O
, O
rather O
than O
retreat O
. O
While O
he O
was O
thinking O
of O
something O
else O
to O
say O
, O
the B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
turned O
to O
the B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
again O
. O
“ O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
where O
you O
got O
that O
pole O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
” O
responded O
Randolph B-PER
. O
“ O
You O
do O
n’t O
mean O
to O
say O
you O
’re O
going O

take O
it O

No O

The B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
pulled O
her O
spectacles O
down O
and O
looked O
over O
them O
about O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
; O
then O
she O
put O
them O
up O

looked O
out O
under O
them O

She O
seldom O

never O
looked O
_ O
through O
_ O
them O
for O
so O
small O
a O
thing O
as O
a B-PER
boy I-PER

they O
were O

the O

She O
looked O
perplexed O
for O
a O
moment O

and O
then O
said O
, O
not O
fiercely O

but O
still O
loud O
enough O
for O

time O
she O
was O
bending O
down O
and O
punching O
under O
the O
bed O
with O
the O
broom O
, O
and O
so O
she O
needed O
breath O
to O
punctuate O
the O
punches O
with O
. O
She O
resurrected O
nothing O
but O
the O
cat O
. O
“ O
I O
never O
did O
see O
the O
beat O
of O
that B-PER
boy I-PER
! O
” O
She O
went O
to O
the O
open O
door O
and O
stood O
in O
it O
and O
looked O
out O
among O
the O
tomato O
vines O
and O
“ O
jimpson O
” O
weeds O
that O
constituted O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
No O
Tom B-PER
. O
So O
she O
lifted O
up O
her O
voice O
at O
an O
angle O
calculated O
for O
distance O
and O
shouted O
: O
“ O
Y-o-u-u O
TOM B-PER
! O
” O
There O
was O
a O
slight O
noise O
behind O
her O
and O
she O
turned O
just O
in O
time O
to O
seize O
a B-PER
small I-PER
boy I-PER
by O
the O
slack O
of O
his O
roundabout O
and O
arrest O
his O
flight O
. O
“ O
There O
! O
I O
might O
' O
a O
' O
thought O
of O
that O
closet B-FAC
. O
What O
you O
been O
doing O
in O
there B-FAC
? O
” O
“ O
Nothing O
. O
” O
“ O
Nothing O
! O
Look O
at O
your O
hands O
. O
And O
look O
at O
your O
mouth O
. O
What O
_ O
is O
_ O
that O
truck O
? O
” O
“ O
I O
do O

aunt B-PER

” O
“ O
Well O
, O
I O
know O

It O

that O

what O
it O
is O

Forty O
times O
I O

said O

n't O
let O
that O
jam O
alone O
I O
'd O
skin O
you O
. O
Hand O
me O
that O
switch O
. O
” O
The O
switch O
hovered O
in O
the O
air O
-- O
the O
peril O
was O
desperate O
-- O
“ O
My O
! O
Look O
behind O
you O
, O
aunt B-PER
! O
” O
The B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
whirled O
round O
, O
and O
snatched O
her O
skirts O
out O
of O
danger O
. O
The B-PER
lad I-PER
fled O
on O
the O
instant O
, O
scrambled O
up O
the O
high O
board-fence O
, O
and O
disappeared O
over O
it O
. O
His B-PER
aunt I-PER
Polly B-PER
stood O
surprised O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
broke O
into O
a O
gentle O
laugh O
. O
“ O
Hang O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
, O
ca O
n't O
I O
never O
learn O
anything O
? O
Ai O

played O
me O
tricks O
enough O

Well-a-well O

when O
all B-PER

I O
'll O
be O
the O
ruination O
of O
the B-PER
child I-PER

” O
Tom B-PER
did O
play O
hookey O
, O
and O
he O
had O
a O
very O
good O
time O
. O
He O
got O
back O
home B-FAC
barely O
in O
season O
to O
help O
Jim B-PER
, O
the B-PER
small I-PER
colored I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
saw O
next-day O
's O
wood O
and O
split O
the O
kindlings O
before O
supper O
-- O
at O
least O
he O
was O
there B-FAC
in O
time O
to O
tell O
his O
adventures O
to O
Jim B-PER
while O
Jim B-PER
did O
three-fourths O
of O
the O
work O
. O
Tom B-PER
's O
younger O
brother O
( O
or O
rather O
half-brother B-PER
) O
Sid B-PER
was O
already O
through O
with O
his O
part O
of O
the O
work O
( O
picking O
up O
chips O
) O
, O
for O
he O
was O
a B-PER
quiet I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
and O
had O
no O
adventurous O
, O
trouble-some O
ways O
. O
While O
Tom B-PER
was O
eating O
his O
supper O
, O
and O
stealing O
sugar O
as O
opportunity O
offered O
, O
Aunt B-PER
Polly O
asked O
him O
questions O
that O
were O
full O
of O
guile O
, O
and O
very O
deep O
-- O
for O
she O
wanted O
to O
trap O
him O
into O
damaging O
revealments O
. O
Like O
many B-PER
other I-PER
simple-hearted I-PER
souls I-PER
, O
it O
was O
her O
pet O
vanity O
to O
believe O
she O
was O
endowed O
with O
a O
talent O
for O
dark O
and O
mysterious O
diplomacy O
, O
and O
she O
loved O
to O
contemplate O
her O
most O
transparent O
devices O
as O
marvels O
of O
low O
cunning O
. O
Said O
she O
: O
“ O
Tom B-PER
, O
it O
was O
middling O
warm O
in O
school B-FAC
, O
war O
n't O
it O
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
'm O
. O
” O
“ O
Powerful O
warm O
, O
war O
n't O
it O
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
'm O
. O
” O
“ O
Did O
n't O
you O
want O
to O
go O
in O
a-swimming O
, O
Tom B-PER
? O
” O
A O
bit O
of O
a O
scare O
shot O
through O
Tom O
-- O
a O
touch O
of O
uncomfortable O
suspicion O
. O
He O
searched O
Aunt B-PER
Polly O
's O
face O
, O
but O
it O
told O
him O
nothing O
. O
So O
he O
said O
: O
“ O
No O
'm O
-- O
well O
, O
not O
very O
much O
. O
” O
The B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
reached O
out O
her O
hand O
and O
felt O
Tom B-PER
's O
shirt O
, O
and O
said O
: O
“ O
But O
you O
ai O
n't O
too O
warm O
now O
, O
though O
. O
” O
And O
it O
flattered O
her O
to O
reflect O
that O
she O
had O
discovered O
that O
the O
shirt O
was O
dry O
without O
anybody B-PER
knowing O
that O
that O
was O
what O
she O
had O
in O
her O
mind O
. O
But O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
, O
Tom B-PER
knew O
where O
the O
wind O
lay O
, O
now O
. O
So O
he O
forestalled O
what O
might O
be O
the O
next O
move O
: O
“ O
Some O
of O
us O
pumped O
on O
our O
heads O
-- O
mine O
's O
damp O
yet O
. O
See O
? O
” O
Aunt B-PER
Polly O
was O
vexed O
to O
think O
she O
had O
overlooked O
that O
bit O
of O
circumstantial O
evidence O
, O
and O
missed O
a O
trick O
. O
Then O
she O
had O
a O
new O
inspiration O
: O
“ O
Tom B-PER
, O
you O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
undo O
your O
shirt O
collar O
where O
I O
sewed O
it O
, O
to O
pump O
on O
your O
head O
, O
did O
you O
? O
Unbutton O
your O
jacket O
! O
” O
The O
trouble O
vanished O
out O
of O
Tom B-PER
's O
face O
. O
He O
opened O
his O
jacket O
. O
His O
shirt O
collar O
was O
securely O
sewed O
. O
“ O
Bother O
! O
Well O
, O
go O
' O
long O
with O
you O
. O
I O
'd O
made O
sure O
you O
'd O
played O
hookey O
and O
been O
a-swimming O
. O
But O
I O
forgive O
ye O
, O
Tom B-PER
. O
I O
reckon O
you O
're O
a O
kind O
of O
a O
singed O
cat O
, O
as O
the O
saying O
is O
-- O
better O
'n O
you O
look O
. O
_ O
This O
_ O
time O
. O
” O
She O
was O
half O
sorry O
her O
sagacity O
had O
miscarried O
, O
and O
half O
glad O
that O
Tom B-PER
had O
stumbled O
into O
obedient O
conduct O
for O
once O
. O
But O
Sidney B-PER
said O
: O
“ O
Well O
, O
now O
, O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
you O
sewed O
his O
collar O
with O
white O
thread O
, O
but O
it O
's O
black O
. O
” O
“ O
Why O
, O
I O
did O
sew O
it O
with O
white O
! O
Tom B-PER
! O
” O
But O
Tom B-PER
did O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
rest O
. O
As O
he O
went O
out O
at O
the O
door O
he O
said O
: O
“ O
Siddy B-PER
, O
I O
'll O
lick O
you O
for O
that O
. O
” O
In O
a O
safe O
place O
Tom B-PER
examined O
two O
large O
needles O
which O
were O
thrust O
into O
the O
lapels O
of O
his O
jacket O
, O
and O
had O
thread O
bound O
about O
them O
-- O
one O
needle O
carried O
white O
thread O
and O
the O
other O
black O
. O
He O
said O
: O
“ O
She O
'd O
never O
noticed O
if O
it O
had O
n't O
been O
for O
Sid B-PER
. O
Confound O
it O
! O
sometimes O
she O
sews O
it O
with O
white O
, O
and O
sometimes O
she O
sews O
it O
with O
black O
. O
I O
wish O
to O
gee-miny O
she O
'd O
stick O
to O
one O
or O
t O
' O
other O
-- O
I O
ca O
n't O
keep O
the O
run O
of O
'em O
. O
But O
I O
bet O
you O
I O
'll O
lam O
Sid B-PER
for O
that O
. O
I O
'll O
learn O
him O
! O
” O
He O
was O
not O
the B-PER
Model I-PER
Boy I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
village I-PER
. O
He O
knew O
the B-PER
model I-PER
boy I-PER
very O
well O
though O
-- O
and O
loathed O
him O
. O
Within O
two O
minutes O
, O
or O
even O
less O
, O
he O
had O
forgotten O
all O
his O
troubles O
. O
Not O
because O
his O
troubles O
were O
one O
whit O
less O
heavy O
and O
bitter O
to O
him O
than O
a B-PER
man I-PER
's O
are O
to O
a B-PER
man I-PER
, O
but O
because O
a O
new O
and O
powerful O
interest O
bore O
them O
down O
and O
drove O
them O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
for O
the O
time O
-- O
just O
as O
men B-PER
's O
misfortunes O
are O
forgotten O
in O
the O
excitement O
of O
new O
enterprises O
. O
This O
new O
interest O
was O
a O
valued O
novelty O
in O
whistling O
, O
which O
he O
had O
just O
acquired O
from O
a B-PER
negro I-PER
, O
and O
he O
was O
suffering O
to O
practise O
it O
un-disturbed O
. O
It O
consisted O
in O
a O
peculiar O
bird-like O
turn O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
liquid O
warble O
, O
produced O
by O
touching O
the O
tongue O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
mouth O
at O
short O
intervals O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
music O
-- O
the B-PER
reader I-PER
probably O
remembers O
how O
to O
do O
it O
, O
if O
he O
has O
ever O
been O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
. O
Diligence O
and O
attention O
soon O
gave O
him O
the O
knack O
of O
it O
, O
and O
he O
strode O
down O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
with O
his O
mouth O
full O
of O
harmony O
and O
his O
soul O
full O
of O
gratitude O
. O
He O
felt O
much O
as O
an B-PER
astronomer I-PER
feels O
who O
has O
discovered O
a O
new O
planet O
-- O
no O
doubt O
, O
as O
far O
as O
strong O
, O
deep O
, O
unalloyed O
pleasure O
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
advantage O
was O
with O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
, O
not O
the B-PER
astronomer I-PER
. O
The O
summer O
evenings O
were O
long O
. O
It O
was O
not O
dark O
, O
yet O
. O
Presently O
Tom B-PER
checked O
his O
whistle O
. O
A B-PER
stranger I-PER
was O
before O
him O
-- O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
a O
shade O
larger O
than O
himself O
. O
A B-PER
new-comer I-PER
of I-PER
any I-PER
age I-PER
or I-PER
either I-PER
sex I-PER
was O
an O
im-pressive O
curiosity O
in O
the B-GPE
poor I-GPE
little I-GPE
shabby I-GPE
village I-GPE
of I-GPE
St. I-GPE
Petersburg I-GPE
. O
This B-PER
boy I-PER
was O
well O
dressed O
, O
too O
-- O
well O
dressed O
on O
a O
week-day O
. O
This O
was O
simply O
as O
astounding O
. O
His O
cap O
was O
a O
dainty O
thing O
, O
his O
close-buttoned O
blue O
cloth O
roundabout O
was O
new O
and O
natty O
, O
and O
so O
were O
his O
pantaloons O
. O
He O
had O
shoes O
on O
-- O
and O
it O
was O
only O
Friday O
. O
He O
even O
wore O
a O
necktie O
, O
a O
bright O
bit O
of O
ribbon O
. O
He O
had O
a O
citified O
air O
about O
him O
that O
ate O
into O
Tom B-PER
's O
vitals O
. O
The O
more O
Tom B-PER
stared O
at O
the O
splendid O
marvel O
, O
the O
higher O
he O
turned O
up O
his O
nose O
at O
his O
finery O
and O
the O
shabbier O
and O
shabbier O
his O
own O
outfit O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
grow O
. O
Neither B-PER
boy I-PER
spoke O
. O
If O
one O
moved O
, O
the O
other O
moved O
-- O
but O
only O
sidewise O
, O
in O
a O
circle O
; O
they O
kept O
face O
to O
face O
and O
eye O
to O
eye O
all O
the O
time O
. O
Finally O
Tom B-PER
said O
: O
“ O
I O
can O
lick O
you O
! O
” O
“ O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
you O
try O
it O

” O
“ O

My B-PER
poor I-PER
people I-PER
, O
have O
you O
lost O
your O
senses O
, O
or O
have O
you O
become O
addicted O
to O
the O
use O
of O
opium O

and O
is O
this O
the O
raving O
of O
two O
fevered O
imaginations O

I O
am O
exactly O
as O
well O
fitted O
to O
take O
care O
of O
one B-PER
hundred I-PER
children I-PER
as O
to O
become O
the O
curator O

a B-FAC

And O
you O
offer O
as O
bait O
an B-PER

My B-PER

likewise O
my B-PER

Jervis B-PER

I O
see O
through O
you O
! O
I O
know O
exactly O
the O
kind O
of O
family O
conference O
that O
has O
been O
held O
about O
the O
Pendleton B-PER
fireside O
. O
" O
Is O
n't O
it O
a O
pity O
that O
Sallie B-PER
has O
n't O
amounted O
to O
more O
since O
she O
left O
college O
? O
She O
ought O
to O
be O
doing O
something O
useful O
instead O
of O
frittering O
her O
time O
away O
in O
the O
petty O
social O
life O
of O
Worcester B-GPE
. O
Also O
[ O
Jervis B-PER
speaks O
] O
she O
is O
getting O
interested O
in O
that B-PER
confounded I-PER
young I-PER
Hallock I-PER
, O
too O
good-looking O
and O
fascinating O
and O
erratic O
; O
I O
never O
did O
like O
politicians B-PER
. O
We O
must O
deflect O
her O
mind O
with O
some O
uplifting O
and O
absorbing O
occupation O
until O
the O
danger O
is O
past O
. O
Ha O
! O
I O
have O
it O
! O
We O
will O
put O
her O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
John B-PER

" O
Oh O
, O
I O
can O
hear O
him O
as O
clearly O
as O
if O
I O
were O
there B-FAC
! O
On O
the O
occasion O
of O
my O
last O
visit O
in O
your B-FAC
delectable I-FAC
household I-FAC
Jervis B-PER
and O
I O
had O
a O
very O
solemn O
conversation O
in O
regard O
to O
( O
1 O
) O
marriage O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
the O
low O
ideals O
of O
politicians B-PER
, O
( O
3 O
) O
the O
frivolous O
, O
useless O
lives O
that O
society B-PER
women I-PER
lead O
. O
Please O
tell O
your B-PER
moral I-PER
husband I-PER
that O
I O
took O
his O
words O
deeply O
to O
heart O
, O
and O
that O
ever O
since O
my O
return O
to O
Worcester B-GPE
I O
have O
been O
spending O
one O
afternoon O
a O
week O
reading O
poetry O
with O
the O
inmates O
of O
the B-FAC
Female I-FAC
Inebriate I-FAC
Asylum I-FAC
. O
My O
life O
is O
not O
so O
purposeless O
as O
it O
appears O
. O
Also O
let O
me O
assure O
you O
that O
the B-PER
politician I-PER
is O
not O
dangerously O
imminent O
; O
and O
that O
, O
anyway O
, O
he O
is O
a B-PER
very I-PER
desirable I-PER
politician I-PER
, O
even O
though O
his O
views O
on O
tariff O
and O
single O
tax O
and O
trade-unionism O
do O
not O
exactly O
coincide O
with O
Jervis B-PER
's O
. O
Your O
desire O
to O
dedicate O
my O
life O
to O
the O
public O
good O
is O
very O
sweet O
, O
but O
you O
should O
look O
at O
it O
from O
the B-ORG
asylum I-ORG
's O
point O
of O
view O
. O
Have O
you O
no O
pity O
for O
those B-PER
poor I-PER
defenseless I-PER
little I-PER
orphan I-PER
children I-PER
? O
I O
have O
, O
if O
you O
have O
n't O
, O
and O
I O
respectfully O
decline O
the O
position O
which O
you O
offer O

I O

however O

THE O
JOHN B-PER
GRIER I-PER
HOME O
, O
February O
15 O
. O
Dear B-PER
Judy I-PER
: O
We O
arrived O
in O
a O
snowstorm O
at O
eleven O
last O
night O
, O
Singapore O
and O
Jane B-PER
and O
I O
. O
It O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
customary O
for O
superintendents O
of O
orphan B-PER
asylums O
to O
bring O
with O
them O
personal B-PER
maids I-PER
and O
Chinese O
chows O
. O
The B-PER
night I-PER
watchman I-PER
and O
housekeeper B-PER
, O
who O
had O
waited O
up O
to O
receive O
me O
, O
were O
thrown O
into O
an O
awful O
flutter O
. O
They O
had O
never O
seen O
the O
like O
of O
Sing O
, O
and O
thought O
that O
I O
was O
introducing O
a O
wolf O
into O
the O
fold O
. O
I O
reassured O
them O
as O
to O
his O
dogginess O
, O
and O
the B-PER
watchman I-PER
, O
after O
studying O
his O
black O
tongue O
, O
ventured O
a O
witticism O
. O
He O
wanted O
to O
know O
if O
I O
fed O
him O
on O
huckleberry O
pie O
. O
It O
was O
difficult O
to O
find O
accommodations O
for O
my B-PER
family I-PER
. O
Poor O
Sing O
was O
dragged O
off O
whimpering O
to O
a B-FAC
strange I-FAC
woodshed I-FAC
, O
and O
given O
a O
piece O
of O
burlap O
. O
Jane B-PER
did O
not O
fare O
much O
better O
. O
There O
was O
not O
an O
extra O
bed O
in O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
, O
barring O
a O
five-foot O
crib O
in O
the B-FAC
hospital I-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
She O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
approaches O
six O
. O
We O
tucked O
her O
in O
, O
and O
she O
spent O
the O
night O
folded O
up O
like O
a O
jackknife O
. O
She O
has O
limped O
about O
today O
, O
looking O
like O
a O
decrepit O
letter O
S O
, O
openly O
deploring O
this O
latest O
escapade O
on O
the O
part O
of O
her B-PER
flighty I-PER
mistress I-PER
, O
and O
longing O
for O
the O
time O
when O
we O
shall O
come O
to O
our O
senses O
, O
and O
return O
to O
the O
parental O
fireside O
in O
Worcester B-GPE
. O
I O
know O
that O
she O
is O
going O
to O
spoil O
all O
my O
chances O
of O
being O
popular O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the B-PER
staff I-PER
. O
Having O
her O
here B-FAC
is O
the O
silliest O
idea O
that O
was O
ever O
conceived O
, O
but O
you O
know O
my B-PER
family I-PER
. O
I O
fought O
their O
objections O
step O
by O
step O
, O
but O
they O
made O
their O
last O
stand O
on O
Jane O
. O
If O
I O
brought O
her O
along O
to O
see O
that O
I O
ate O
nourishing O
food O
and O
did O
n't O
stay O
up O
all O
night O
, O
I O
might O
come O
-- O
temporarily O
; O
but O
if O
I O
refused O
to O
bring O
her O
-- O
oh O
, O
dear O
me O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
was O
ever O
again O
to O
cross O
the O
threshold O
of O
Stone B-FAC
Gate I-FAC
! O
So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
and O
neither O
of O
us O
very O
welcome O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
. O
I O
woke O
by O
a O
gong O
at O
six O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
lay O
for O
a O
time O
listening O
to O
the O
racket O
that O
twenty-five B-PER
little I-PER
girls I-PER
made O
in O
the B-FAC
lavatory I-FAC
over O
my O
head O
. O
It O
appears O
that O
they O
do O
not O
get O
baths O
, O
-- O
just O
face-washes O
, O
-- O
but O
they O
make O
as O
much O
splashing O
as O
twenty-five O
puppies O
in O
a B-FAC
pool I-FAC
. O
I O
rose O
and O
dressed O
and O
explored O
a O
bit O
. O
You O
were O
wise O
in O
not O
having O
me O
come O
to O
look O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
over O
before O
I O
engaged O
. O
While O
my O
little O
charges O
were O
at O
breakfast O
, O
it O
seemed O
a O
happy O
time O
to O
introduce O
myself O
; O
so O
I O
sought O
the B-FAC
dining I-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
Horror O
piled O
on O
horror O
-- O
those O
bare O
drab O
walls O
and O
oil-cloth-covered O
tables O
with O
tin O
cups O
and O
plates O
and O
wooden O
benches O
, O
and O
, O
by O
way O
of O
decoration O
, O
that O
one O
illuminated O
text O
, O
" O
The O
Lord B-PER
Will O
Provide O
" O
! O
The B-PER
trustee I-PER
who I-PER
added I-PER
that I-PER
last I-PER
touch I-PER
must O
possess O
a O
grim O
sense O
of O
humor O
. O
Really O
, O
Judy B-PER
, O
I O
never O
knew O
there O
was O
any O
spot O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
so O
entirely O
ugly O
; O
and O
when O
I O
saw O
those O
rows O
and O
rows O
of O
pale B-PER
, I-PER
listless I-PER
, I-PER
blue-uniformed I-PER
children I-PER
, O
the O
whole O
dismal O
business O
suddenly O
struck O
me O
with O
such O
a O
shock O
that O
I O
almost O
collapsed O
. O
It O
seemed O
like O
an O
unachievable O
goal O
for O
one B-PER
person I-PER
to O
bring O
sunshine O
to O
one O
hundred O
little O
faces O
when O
what O
they O
need O
is O
a B-PER
mother I-PER
apiece O
. O
I O
plunged O
into O
this O
thing O
lightly O
enough O
, O
partly O
because O
you O
were O
too O
persuasive O
, O
and O
mostly O
, O
I O
honestly O
think O
, O
because O
that B-PER
scurrilous I-PER
Gordon I-PER
Hallock I-PER
laughed O
so O
uproariously O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
my O
being O
able O
to O
manage O
an B-FAC
asylum I-FAC
. O
Between O
you O
all O
you O
hypnotized O
me O
. O
And O
then O
of O
course O
, O
after O
I O
began O
reading O
up O
on O
the O
subject O
and O
visiting O
all B-FAC
those I-FAC
seventeen I-FAC
institutions I-FAC
, O
I O
got O
excited O
over O
orphans B-PER
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
put O
my O
own O
ideas O
into O
practice O
. O
But O
now O
I O
'm O
aghast O
at O
finding O
myself O
here B-FAC
; O
it O
's O
such O
a O
stupendous O
undertaking O
. O
The O
future O
health O
and O
happiness O
of O
a B-PER
hundred I-PER
human I-PER
beings I-PER
lie O
in O
my O
hands O
, O
to O
say O
nothing O
of O
their B-PER
three I-PER
or I-PER
four I-PER
hundred I-PER
children I-PER
and O
thousand B-PER
grandchildren I-PER
. O
The O
thing O
's O
geometrically O
progressive O
. O
It O
's O
awful O
. O
Who O
am O
I O
to O
undertake O
this O
job O
? O
Look O
, O
oh O
, O
look O
for O
another B-PER
superintendent I-PER
! O
Jane B-PER
says O
dinner O
's O
ready O
. O
Having O
eaten O
two O
of O
your O
institution O
meals O
, O
the O
thought O
of O
another O
does O
n't O
excite O
me O
. O
LATER O
. O
The B-PER
staff I-PER
had O
mutton O
hash O
and O
spinach O
, O
with O
tapioca O
pudding O
for O
dessert O
. O
What O
the B-PER
children I-PER
had O
I O
hate O
to O
consider O
. O
I O
started O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
my O
first O
official O
speech O
at O
breakfast O
this O
morning O
. O
It O
dealt O
with O
all O
the O
wonderful O
new O
changes O
that O
are O
to O
come O
to O
the O
John B-PER
Grier I-PER
Home O
through O
the O
generosity O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Jervis O
Pendleton O
, O
the O
president O
of O
our O
board O
of O
trustees B-PER
, O
and O
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Pendleton O
, O
the O
dear O
" O
Aunt O
Judy O
" O
of O
every O
little O
boy O
and O
girl O
here B-FAC
. O
Please O
do O
n't O
object O
to O
my O
featuring O
the B-PER
Pendleton I-PER
family I-PER
so O
prominently O
. O
I O
did O
it O
for O
political O
reasons O
. O
As O
the O
entire O
working O
staff O
of O
the B-FAC
institution I-FAC
was O
present O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
a O
good O
opportunity O
to O
emphasize O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
of O
these O
upsetting O
, O
innovations O
come O
straight O
from O
headquarters O
, O
and O
not O
out O
of O
my O
excitable O
brain O
. O
The B-PER
children I-PER
stopped O
eating O
and O
stared O
. O
The O
conspicuous O
color O
of O
my O
hair O
and O
the O
frivolous O
tilt O
of O
my O
nose O
are O
evidently O
new O
attributes O
in O
a B-PER
superintendent I-PER
. O
My B-PER
colleagues I-PER
also O
showed O
plainly O
that O
they O
consider O
me O
too O
young O
and O
too O
inexperienced O
to O
be O
set O
in O
authority O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
Jervis B-PER
's O
wonderful O
Scotch O
doctor O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
he O
will O
have O
to O
be O
VERY O
wonderful O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
of I-PER
these I-PER
people I-PER
, O
especially O
the B-PER
kindergarten I-PER
teacher I-PER
. O
Miss B-PER
Snaith O
and O
I O
clashed O
early O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
fresh O
air O
; O
but O
I O
intend O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
this O
dreadful O
institution O
smell O
, O
if O
I O
freeze O
every B-PER
child I-PER
into O
a O
little O
ice O
statue O
. O
This O
being O
a O
sunny O
, O
sparkling O
, O
snowy O
afternoon O
, O
I O
ordered O
that O
dungeon O
of O
a O
playroom O
closed O
and O
the B-PER
children I-PER
out O
of O
doors O
. O
" O
She O
's O
chasin O
' O
us O
out O
, O
" O
I O
heard O
one B-PER
small I-PER
urchin I-PER
grumbling O
as O
he O
struggled O
into O
a O
two-years-too-small O
overcoat O
. O
They O
simply O
stood O
about O
the B-FAC
yard I-FAC
, O
all O
humped O
in O
their O
clothes O
, O
waiting O
patiently O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
come O
back O
in O
. O
No O
running O
or O
shouting O
or O
coasting O
or O
snowballs O
. O
Think O
of O
it O
! O
These B-PER
children I-PER
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
play O
. O
STILL O
LATER O
. O
I O
have O
already O
begun O
the O
congenial O
task O
of O
spending O
your O
money O
. O
I O
bought O
eleven O
hot-water O
bottles O
this O
afternoon O
( O
every O
one O
that O
the O
village B-GPE
drug O
store O
contained O
) O
likewise O
some O
woolen O
blankets O
and O
padded O
quilts O
. O
And O
the O
windows O
are O
wide O
open O
in O
the B-PER
babies I-PER
' O
dormitory O
. O
Those B-PER
poor I-PER
little I-PER
tots I-PER
are O
going O
to O
enjoy O
the O
perfectly O
new O
sensation O
of O
being O
able O
to O
breathe O
at O
night O
. O
There O
are O
a O
million O
things O
I O
want O
to O
grumble O
about O
, O
but O
it O
's O
half-past O
ten O
, O
and O
Jane B-PER
says O
I O
MUST O
go O
to O
bed O
. O
Yours O
in O
command O
, O
SALLIE B-PER
McBRIDE I-PER
. O
P.S. O
Before O
turning O
in O
, O
I O
tiptoed O
through O
the B-FAC
corridor I-FAC
to O
make O
sure O

and O
the B-PER
Ambersons I-PER
were O
magnificent O
in O
their O
day O

Their O
splendour O
lasted O
throughout O
all O
the O

that O
saw O
their B-GPE
Midland I-GPE
town I-GPE
spread O

into O
a B-GPE

but O
reached O
its O
topmost O
during O
the O
period O
when O
every O

In O

when O

everybody B-PER
recognized O
both O
the O

the B-PER

and O
again O
knew O
them O
as O
well O
on O

when O

During O

elegance O

was O
believed O
to O
rest O
more O

the O

upon O

A O

needed O
no O

when O
it O
was O
a O

; O
it O
remained O
distinguished O
by O
merely O
remaining O
silk O

Old B-PER
men I-PER

wore O
broadcloth O
; O
“ O
full O

” O
was O
broadcloth O
with O
“ O

and O
there O
were O
seen O
men B-PER
of I-PER
all I-PER
ages I-PER
to I-PER
whom I-PER
a I-PER
hat I-PER
meant I-PER
only I-PER
that I-PER

thing I-PER
known I-PER
to I-PER
impudence I-PER
as I-PER
a I-PER
“ I-PER

” I-PER
In O
town B-GPE
and O
country B-LOC
these B-PER
men I-PER
would O
wear O
no O
other O
hat O
, O
and O
, O
without O
self-consciousness O
, O
they O
went O
rowing O
in O
such O
hats O

Shifting O
fashions O
of O

replaced O

dressmakers B-PER

hatmakers B-PER
, O
and O
tailors B-PER
, O
increasing O
in O
cunning O

in O

, O
found O
means O
to O
make O
new O

old O

The O
long O
contagion O
of O
the O
“ O

hat O
arrived O
: O
one O
season O
the O
crown O
of O
this O
hat O
would O
be O
a O

the O
next O
it O
would O
be O
a O

Every B-FAC
house I-FAC
still O
kept O
its O
bootjack O
, O
but O
high-topped O
boots O
gave O
way O
to O
shoes O
and O
“ O
congress O
gaiters O
” O
; O
and O
these O
were O
played O
through O
fashions O
that O
shaped O
them O
now O
with O
toes O
like O
box-ends O
and O
now O
with O
toes O
like O
the O
prows O
of O
racing B-VEH
shells I-VEH
. O
Trousers O
with O
a O
crease O
were O
considered O
plebeian O
; O
the O
crease O
proved O
that O
the O
garment O
had O
lain O
upon O
a O
shelf O
, O
and O
hence O
was O
“ O
ready-made O
” O
; O
these O
betraying O
trousers O
were O
called O
“ O
hand-me-downs O
, O
” O
in O
allusion O
to O
the O
shelf O
. O
In O
the O
early O
' O
eighties O
, O
while O
bangs O
and O
bustles O
were O
having O
their O
way O
with O
women B-PER
, O
that O
variation O
of O
dandy B-PER
known O
as O
the B-PER
“ I-PER
dude I-PER
” I-PER
was O
invented O
: O
he O
wore O
trousers O
as O
tight O
as O
stockings O
, O
dagger-pointed O
shoes O
, O
a O
spoon O
“ O
Derby O
, O
” O
a O
single-breasted O
coat O
called O
a O
“ O
Chesterfield O
, O
” O
with O
short O
flaring O
skirts O
, O
a O
torturing O
cylindrical O
collar O
, O
laundered O
to O
a O
polish O
and O
three O
inches O
high O
, O
while O
his O

might O
be O
a O
heavy O

puffed O
cravat O
or O
a O
tiny O
bow O
fit O
for O
a O

With O
evening O
dress O
he O
wore O
a O
tan O
overcoat O
so O
short O
that O
his O
black O
coat-tails O
hung O
visible O
, O
five O
inches O
below O
the O
over-coat O
; O
but O
after O
a O
season O
or O
two O
he O
lengthened O
his O
overcoat O
till O
it O
touched O
his O
heels O
, O
and O
he O
passed O
out O
of O
his O
tight O
trousers O
into O
trousers O
like O
great O
bags O
. O
Then O
, O
presently O
, O
he O
was O
seen O
no O
more O
, O
though O
the O
word O
that O
had O
been O
coined O
for O
him O
remained O
in O
the O
vocabularies O
of O
the O
impertinent O

It O
was O
a O
hairier O

this O

the B-PER
wearers I-PER
' O
fancy O
, O
and O
things O
as O
strange O
as O
the O
Kaiserliche O
boar-tusk O

were O
commonplace O
. O
“ O
Side-burns O
” O
found O
nourishment O
upon O
childlike O
profiles O
; O
great O
Dundreary O
whiskers O
blew O
like O
tippets O
over O
young O
shoulders O
; O
moustaches O
were O
trained O
as O
lambrequins O
over O
forgotten O
mouths O
; O
and O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
a O
Senator O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
to O
wear O
a O
mist O
of O
white O
whisker O
upon O
his O

only O
, O
not O
a O

in O
the B-GPE

a O

Surely O
no O

is O
needed O
to O
prove O
that O
so O

a O

At O

Ambersons I-PER
' O
great O
period O
most O
of O
the O
houses O
of O
the B-GPE

were O
of O
a O
pleasant O
architecture O
. O
They O
lacked O

but O
also O
lacked O
pretentiousness O
, O
and O
whatever O

not O

They O
stood O
in O
commodious O

well O
shaded O
by O

elm O

with O

a O

Commonly O

the B-PER

more O
in O

a B-FAC

The O
upholstery O
of O
the B-FAC

was O
a O
little O
shabby O
; O
but O
the O
hostile O
chairs O

of O
the B-FAC
“ I-FAC

always O
looked O
new O

For O
all O
the O

Upstairs B-FAC

often O
a O

two O
that O

not O

during O

there O
developed O
an O
appreciation O

the B-PER

The B-PER

lived O
in O
the B-FAC

After O

the O

the B-FAC

gay O

laughter O

went O
up O

down O
their B-FAC
dusty I-FAC
lengths I-FAC

with O
a O
lively O
accompaniment O
of O
curry-combs O
knocking O
against O

fences O

walls O
, O
for O
the B-PER
darkies I-PER
loved O
to O
curry O
their O

the B-FAC

Darkies B-PER
always O
prefer O
to O
gossip O
in O

instead O
of O

and O
they O
feel O
that O
profanity O

unless O
it O

is O
almost O

Horrible O

sometimes O
at O

while O
less B-PER

would O
often O
merely O
repeat O
the O
phrases O
in O
some O
subsequent O

yet O
bring O
about O
consequences O
so O
emphatic O

They O
have O
passed O

those O
darky O
hired-men O

the B-GPE

; O
and O
the O
introspective O
horses O
they O
curried O

whacked O

amiably O
cursed O

no O

For O
all O
their O

they O
might O

vanished O
. O
So O
with O
other O
vanishings O
. O
There O
were O
the B-VEH
little I-VEH
bunty I-VEH
street-cars I-VEH
on O
the B-FAC
long I-FAC
, I-FAC
single I-FAC
track I-FAC
that I-FAC
went I-FAC
its I-FAC
troubled I-FAC
way I-FAC
among I-FAC
the I-FAC
cobblestones I-FAC
. O
At O
the O
rear O
door O
of O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
there O
was O
no O
platform O
, O
but O
a O
step O
where O
passengers B-PER
clung O
in O
wet O
clumps O
when O
the O
weather O
was O
bad O
and O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
crowded O
. O
The B-PER
patrons I-PER
-- O
if O
not O
too O
absent-minded O
-- O
put O
their O
fares O
into O
a O
slot O
; O
and O
no B-PER
conductor I-PER
paced O
the O
heaving O
floor O
, O
but O
the B-PER
driver I-PER
would O
rap O
remindingly O
with O
his O
elbow O
upon O
the O
glass O
of O
the O
door O
to O
his O
little O
open O
platform O
if O
the O
nickels O
and O
the B-PER
passengers I-PER
did O
not O
appear O
to O
coincide O
in O
number O
. O
A O
lone O
mule O
drew O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
, O
and O
sometimes O
drew O
it O
off O
the O
track O
, O
when O
the B-PER
passengers I-PER
would O
get O
out O
and O
push O
it O
on O
again O
. O
They O
really O
owed O
it O
courtesies O
like O
this O
, O
for O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
was O
genially O
accommodating O
: O
a B-PER
lady I-PER
could O
whistle O
to O
it O
from O
an O
upstairs B-FAC
window O
, O
and O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
would O
halt O
at O
once O
and O
wait O
for O
her O
while O
she O
shut O
the O
window O
, O
put O
on O
her O
hat O
and O
cloak O
, O
went O
downstairs B-FAC
, O
found O
an O
umbrella O
, O
told O
the B-PER
“ I-PER
girl I-PER
” I-PER
what O
to O
have O
for O
dinner O
, O
and O
came O
forth O
from O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
The B-PER
previous I-PER
passengers I-PER
made O
little O
objection O
to O
such O
gallantry O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
: O
they O
were O
wont O
to O
expect O
as O
much O
for O
themselves O
on O
like O
occasion O
. O
In O
good O
weather O
the O
mule O
pulled O
the B-VEH
car I-VEH
a O
mile O
in O
a O
little O
less O
than O
twenty O
minutes O
, O
unless O
the O
stops O
were O
too O
long O
; O
but O
when O
the B-VEH
trolley-car I-VEH
came O
, O
doing O
its O
mile O
in O
five O
minutes O
and O
better O
, O
it O
would O
wait O
for O
nobody B-PER
. O
Nor O
could O
its B-PER
passengers I-PER
have O
endured O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
because O
the O
faster O
they O
were O
carried O
the O
less O
time O
they O
had O
to O
spare O
! O
In O
the O
days O
before O
deathly O
contrivances O
hustled O
them O
through O
their O
lives O
, O
and O
when O
they O
had O
no O
telephones O
-- O
another O
ancient O
vacancy O
profoundly O
responsible O
for O
leisure O
-- O
they O
had O
time O
for O
everything O
: O
time O
to O
think O
, O
to O
talk O
, O
time O
to O
read O
, O
time O
to O
wait O
for O
a B-PER

OLIVER B-PER

OF O
THE O
CIRCUMSTANCES O
ATTENDING O
HIS O
BIRTH O
Among O
other B-FAC
public I-FAC

in O
a B-GPE
certain I-GPE
town I-GPE

which O
for O
many O
reasons O
it O
will O
be O
prudent O
to O
refrain O
from O
mentioning O
, O
and O
to O
which O
I O
will O
assign O
no O
fictitious O
name O

there O
is O
one O
anciently O
common O
to O
most B-GPE
towns I-GPE
, O
great O
or O
small O
: O
to O
wit O
, O
a B-FAC
workhouse I-FAC
; O
and O
in O
this B-FAC
workhouse I-FAC
was O
born O
; O
on O
a O
day O
and O
date O
which O
I O
need O
not O
trouble O
myself O
to O
repeat O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
can O
be O
of O
no O
possible O
consequence O
to O
the O

this O
stage O

the O
item O
of O
mortality O
whose O
name O
is O
prefixed O
to O
the O
head O
of O
this O
chapter O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
after O
it O
was O
ushered O
into O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
of I-LOC
sorrow I-LOC
and I-LOC
trouble I-LOC
, O
by O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
surgeon O
, O
it O
remained O
a O
matter O
of O
considerable O
doubt O
whether O
the B-PER
child I-PER
would O
survive O
to O
bear O
any O
name O
at O
all O
; O
in O
which O
case O
it O
is O
somewhat O
more O
than O
probable O
that O
these O
memoirs O
would O
never O
have O
appeared O
; O
or O
, O
if O
they O
had O
, O
that O
being O
comprised O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
pages O
, O
they O
would O
have O
possessed O
the O
inestimable O
merit O
of O
being O
the O
most O
concise O
and O
faithful O
specimen O
of O
biography O
, O
extant O
in O
the O
literature O
of O
any O
age O
or O
country B-GPE
. O
Although O
I O
am O
not O
disposed O
to O
maintain O
that O
the O
being O
born O
in O
a B-FAC
workhouse I-FAC
, O
is O
in O
itself O
the O
most O
fortunate O
and O
enviable O
circumstance O
that O
can O
possibly O
befall O
a B-PER
human I-PER
being I-PER
, O
I O
do O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
in O
this O
particular O
instance O
, O
it O
was O
the O
best O
thing O
for O
Oliver B-PER
Twist I-PER
that O
could O
by O
possibility O
have O
occurred O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
there O
was O
considerable O
difficulty O
in O
inducing O
Oliver B-PER
to O
take O
upon O
himself O
the O
office O
of O
respiration O
, O
-- O
a O
troublesome O
practice O
, O
but O
one O
which O
custom O
has O
rendered O
necessary O
to O
our O
easy O
existence O
; O
and O
for O
some O
time O
he O
lay O
gasping O
on O
a O
little O
flock O
mattress O
, O
rather O
unequally O
poised O
between O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
and O
the O
next O
: O
the O
balance O
being O
decidedly O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
latter O
. O
Now O
, O
if O
, O
during O
this O
brief O
period O
, O
Oliver B-PER
had O
been O
surrounded O
by O
careful B-PER
grandmothers I-PER
, O
anxious B-PER
aunts I-PER
, O
experienced B-PER
nurses I-PER
, O
and O
doctors B-PER
of I-PER
profound I-PER
wisdom I-PER
, O
he O
would O
most O
inevitably O
and O
indubitably O
have O
been O
killed O
in O
no O
time O
. O
There O
being O
nobody B-PER
by O
, O
however O
, O
but O
a O
pauper B-PER
old I-PER
woman I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
rendered I-PER
rather I-PER
misty I-PER
by I-PER
an I-PER
unwonted I-PER
allowance I-PER
of I-PER
beer I-PER
; O
and O
a B-FAC
parish I-FAC
surgeon O
who O
did O
such O
matters O
by O
contract O
; O
Oliver B-PER
and O
Nature O
fought O
out O
the O
point O
between O
them O
. O
The O
result O
was O
, O
that O
, O
after O
a O
few O
struggles O
, O
Oliver B-PER
breathed O
, O
sneezed O
, O
and O
proceeded O
to O
advertise O
to O
the O
inmates O
of O
the B-FAC
workhouse I-FAC
the O
fact O
of O
a O
new O
burden O
having O
been O
imposed O
upon O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
, O
by O
setting O
up O
as O
loud O
a O
cry O
as O
could O
reasonably O
have O
been O
expected O
from O
a B-PER
male I-PER
infant I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
not I-PER
been I-PER
possessed I-PER
of I-PER
that I-PER
very I-PER
useful I-PER
appendage I-PER
, I-PER
a I-PER
voice I-PER
, I-PER
for I-PER
a I-PER
much I-PER
longer I-PER
space I-PER
of I-PER
time I-PER
than I-PER
three I-PER
minutes I-PER
and I-PER
a I-PER
quarter I-PER
. O
As O
Oliver B-PER
gave O
this O
first O
proof O
of O
the O
free O
and O
proper O
action O
of O
his O
lungs O
, O
the O
patchwork O
coverlet O
which O
was O
carelessly O
flung O
over O
the O
iron O
bedstead O
, O
rustled O
; O
the O
pale O
face O
of O
a B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
was O
raised O
feebly O
from O
the O
pillow O
; O
and O
a O
faint O
voice O
imperfectly O
articulated O
the O
words O
, O
' O
Let O
me O
see O
the B-PER
child I-PER
, O
and O
die O
. O
' O
The B-PER
surgeon I-PER
had O
been O
sitting O
with O
his O
face O
turned O
towards O
the O
fire O
: O
giving O
the O
palms O
of O
his O
hands O
a O
warm O
and O
a O
rub O
alternately O
. O
As O
the B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
spoke O
, O
he O
rose O
, O
and O
advancing O
to O
the O
bed O
's O
head O
, O
said O
, O
with O
more O
kindness O
than O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
of O
him O
: O
' O
Oh O
, O
you O
must O
not O
talk O
about O
dying O
yet O
. O
' O
' O
Lor O
bless O
her O
dear O
heart O
, O
no O
! O
' O
interposed O
the B-PER
nurse I-PER
, O
hastily O
depositing O
in O
her O
pocket O
a O
green O
glass O
bottle O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
which O
she O
had O
been O
tasting O
in O
a O
corner O
with O
evident O
satisfaction O
. O
' O
Lor O
bless O
her O
dear O
heart O
, O
when O
she O
has O
lived O
as O
long O
as O
I O
have O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
and O
had O
thirteen B-PER
children I-PER
of I-PER
her I-PER
own I-PER
, O
and O
all O
on O
'em O
dead O
except O
two O
, O
and O
them O
in O
the O
wurkus O
with O
me O
, O
she O
'll O
know O
better O
than O
to O
take O
on O
in O
that O
way O
, O
bless O
her O
dear O
heart O
! O
Think O
what O
it O
is O
to O
be O
a B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
there O
's O
a O
dear O
young O
lamb O
do O
. O
' O
Apparently O
this O
consolatory O
perspective O
of O
a B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
prospects O
failed O
in O
producing O
its O
due O
effect O
. O
The B-PER
patient I-PER
shook O
her O
head O
, O
and O
stretched O
out O
her O
hand O
towards O
the B-PER
child I-PER
. O
The B-PER
surgeon I-PER
deposited O
it O
in O
her O
arms O
. O
She O
imprinted O
her O
cold O
white O
lips O
passionately O
on O
its O
forehead O
; O
passed O
her O
hands O
over O
her O
face O
; O
gazed O
wildly O
round O
; O
shuddered O
; O
fell O
back O
-- O
and O
died O
. O
They O
chafed O
her O
breast O
, O
hands O
, O
and O
temples O
; O
but O
the O
blood O
had O
stopped O
forever O
. O
They O
talked O
of O
hope O
and O
comfort O
. O
They O
had O
been O
strangers B-PER
too O
long O
. O
' O
It O
's O
all O
over O
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Thingummy O
! O
' O
said O
the B-PER
surgeon I-PER
at O
last O
. O
' O
Ah O
, O
poor O
dear O
, O
so O
it O
is O
! O
' O
said O
the O
nurse O
, O
picking O
up O
the O
cork O
of O
the O
green O
bottle O
, O
which O
had O
fallen O
out O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
as O
she O
stooped O
to O
take O
up O
the B-PER
child I-PER

' O
Poor O
dear O
! O
' O
' O
You O
need O

mind O
sending O
up O
to O
me O
, O
if O
the B-PER
child I-PER
cries O

nurse B-PER

' O
said O
the B-PER
surgeon I-PER
, O
putting O
on O
his O
gloves O
with O
great O
deliberation O
. O
' O
It O
's O
very O
likely O
it O

will O
_ O
be O
troublesome O

Give O
it O
a O
little O
gruel O
if O
it O

' O
He O
put O
on O
his O
hat O

and O
, O
pausing O
by O
the O
bed-side O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
door O

added O
, O
' O

over O

The O

The B-PER
medical I-PER

the B-PER
nurse I-PER

having O
once O

herself O

the O
green O

sat O
down O
on O
a O
low O
chair O
before O
the O
fire O

proceeded O
to O
dress O
the B-PER
infant I-PER

What O
an O
excellent O
example O
of O
the O
power O
of O
dress O

young B-PER
Oliver I-PER

! O
Wrapped O
in O
the O
blanket O
which O
had O
hitherto O
formed O

only O
covering O

he O
might O
have O
been O
the O
child O
of O
a B-PER
nobleman I-PER

it O
would O

, O
AND O
BOARD O
For O
the O
next O
eight O
or O
ten O
months O
, O
Oliver B-PER
was O
the O
victim O
of O
a O
systematic O
course O
of O
treachery O
and O
deception O
. O
He O
was O
brought O
up O
by O
hand O
. O
The O
hungry O
and O
destitute O
situation O
of O
the B-PER
infant I-PER
orphan I-PER
was O
duly O
reported O
by O
the B-FAC
workhouse I-FAC
authorities O
to O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
authorities O
. O
The B-FAC
parish I-FAC
authorities O
inquired O
with O
dignity O
of O
the B-FAC
workhouse I-FAC
authorities O
, O
whether O
there O
was O
no O
female O
then O
domiciled O
in O

the B-FAC

who O
was O
in O
a O
situation O

to O
Oliver B-PER
Twist I-PER

the O
consolation O
and O
nourishment O
of O
which O
he O
stood O
in O
need O
. O
The B-FAC
workhouse I-FAC
authorities O
replied O
with O
humility O
, O
that O
there O
was O
not O
. O
Upon O
this O
, O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
authorities O
magnanimously O

humanely O
resolved O

that O
Oliver B-PER
should O
be O

' O
or O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
that O
he O

branch-workhouse I-FAC
some I-FAC
three I-FAC
miles I-FAC

twenty B-PER

inconvenience O
of O
too O
much O
food O
or O
too O
much O
clothing O
, O
under O
the O
parental O
superintendence O
of O
an B-PER
elderly I-PER
female I-PER
, O
who O
received O
the B-PER
culprits I-PER
at O
and O
for O
the O
consideration O
of O
sevenpence-halfpenny O
per O
small O
head O
per O
week O
. O
Sevenpence-halfpenny O
's O
worth O
per O
week O
is O
a O
good O
round O
diet O
for O
a B-PER
child I-PER
; O
a O
great O
deal O
may O
be O
got O
for O
sevenpence-halfpenny O
, O
quite O
enough O
to O
overload O
its O
stomach O
, O
and O
make O
it O
uncomfortable O
. O
The B-PER
elderly I-PER
female I-PER
was O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
of I-PER
wisdom I-PER
and I-PER
experience I-PER
; O
she O
knew O
what O
was O
good O
for O
children B-PER
; O
and O
she O
had O
a O
very O
accurate O
perception O
of O
what O
was O
good O
for O
herself O
. O
So O
, O
she O
appropriated O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
weekly O
stipend O
to O
her O
own O
use O
, O
and O
consigned O
the B-PER
rising I-PER
parochial I-PER
generation I-PER
to O
even O
a O
shorter O
allowance O
than O
was O
originally O
provided O
for O
them O
. O
Thereby O
finding O
in O
the O
lowest O
depth O
a O
deeper O
still O
; O
and O
proving O
herself O
a B-PER
very I-PER
great I-PER
experimental I-PER
philosopher I-PER
. O
Everybody B-PER
knows O
the O
story O
of O
another B-PER
experimental I-PER
philosopher I-PER
who O
had O
a O
great O
theory O
about O
a O
horse O
being O
able O
to O
live O
without O
eating O
, O
and O
who O
demonstrated O
it O
so O
well O
, O
that O
he O
had O
got O
his O
own O
horse O
down O
to O
a O
straw O
a O
day O
, O
and O
would O
unquestionably O
have O
rendered O
him O
a O
very O
spirited O
and O
rampacious O
animal O
on O
nothing O
at O
all O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
died O
, O
four-and-twenty O
hours O
before O
he O
was O
to O
have O
had O
his O
first O
comfortable O
bait O
of O
air O
. O
Unfortunately O
for O
, O
the O
experimental O
philosophy O
of O
the O
female O
to O
whose O
protecting O
care O
Oliver B-PER
Twist I-PER
was O
delivered O
over O
, O
a O
similar O
result O
usually O
attended O
the O
operation O
of O
_ O
her O
_ O
system O
; O
for O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
the B-PER
child I-PER
had O
contrived O
to O
exist O
upon O
the O
smallest O
possible O
portion O
of O
the O
weakest O
possible O
food O
, O
it O
did O
perversely O
happen O
in O
eight O
and O
a O
half O
cases O
out O
of O
ten O
, O
either O
that O
it O
sickened O
from O
want O
and O
cold O
, O
or O
fell O
into O
the O
fire O
from O
neglect O
, O
or O
got O
half-smothered O
by O
accident O
; O
in O
any O
one O
of O
which O
cases O
, O
the B-PER
miserable I-PER
little I-PER
being I-PER
was O
usually O
summoned O
into O
another B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
and O
there O
gathered O
to O
the B-PER
fathers I-PER
it I-PER
had I-PER
never I-PER
known I-PER
in I-PER
this I-PER
. O
Occasionally O
, O
when O
there O
was O
some O
more O
than O
usually O
interesting O
inquest O
upon O
a B-FAC
parish I-FAC
child O
who O
had O
been O
overlooked O
in O
turning O
up O
a O
bedstead O
, O
or O
inadvertently O
scalded O
to O
death O
when O
there O
happened O
to O
be O
a O
washing O
-- O
though O
the O
latter O
accident O
was O
very O
scarce O
, O
anything O
approaching O
to O
a O
washing O
being O
of O
rare O
occurrence O
in O
the B-FAC
farm I-FAC
-- O
the B-PER
jury I-PER
would O
take O
it O
into O
their O
heads O
to O
ask O
troublesome O
questions O
, O
or O
the B-PER
parishioners I-PER
would O
rebelliously O
affix O
their O
signatures O
to O
a O
remonstrance O
. O
But O
these O
impertinences O
were O
speedily O
checked O
by O
the O
evidence O
of O
the B-PER
surgeon I-PER
, O
and O
the O
testimony O
of O
the B-PER
beadle I-PER
; O
the O
former O
of O
whom O
had O
always O
opened O
the B-PER
body I-PER
and O
found O
nothing O
inside O
( O
which O
was O
very O
probable O
indeed O
) O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
of O
whom O
invariably O
swore O
whatever O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
wanted O
; O
which O
was O
very O
self-devotional O
. O
Besides O
, O
the B-PER
board I-PER
made O
periodical O
pilgrimages O
to O
the B-FAC
farm I-FAC
, O
and O
always O
sent O
the B-PER
beadle I-PER
the O
day O
before O
, O
to O
say O
they O
were O
going O
. O
The B-PER
children I-PER
were O
neat O
and O
clean O
to O
behold O
, O
when O
_ O
they O
_ O
went O
; O

DESCRIPTION O
OF O
FARMER B-PER
OAK I-PER
-- O
AN O
INCIDENT O
When O
Farmer B-PER
Oak I-PER
smiled O
, O
the O
corners O
of O
his O
mouth O
spread O
till O
they O
were O
within O
an O
unimportant O
distance O
of O
his O
ears O
, O
his O
eyes O
were O
reduced O
to O
chinks O
, O
and O
diverging O
wrinkles O
appeared O
round O
them O
, O
extending O
upon O
his O
countenance O
like O
the O
rays O
in O
a O
rudimentary O
sketch O
of O
the O
rising O
sun O
. O
His O
Christian O
name O
was O
Gabriel B-PER
, O
and O
on O
working O
days O
he O
was O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
sound I-PER
judgment I-PER
, I-PER
easy I-PER
motions I-PER
, I-PER
proper I-PER
dress I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
general I-PER
good I-PER
character I-PER
. O
On O
Sundays O
he O
was O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
misty I-PER
views I-PER
, O
rather O
given O
to O
postponing O
, O
and O
hampered O
by O
his O
best O
clothes O
and O
umbrella O
: O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
one O
who O
felt O
himself O
to O
occupy O
morally O
that O
vast O
middle O
space O
of O
Laodicean O
neutrality O
which O
lay O
between O
the O
Communion O
people O
of O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
and O
the B-PER
drunken I-PER
section I-PER
, O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
he O
went O
to O
church B-FAC
, O
but O
yawned O
privately O
by O
the O
time O
the O
con O
- O
gegation O
reached O
the O
Nicene O
creed O
, O
- O
and O
thought O
of O
what O
there O
would O
be O
for O
dinner O
when O
he O
meant O
to O
be O
listening O
to O
the O
sermon O
. O
Or O
, O
to O
state O
his O
character O
as O
it O
stood O
in O
the O
scale O
of O
public O
opinion O
, O
when O
his B-PER
friends I-PER
and O
critics B-PER
were O
in O
tantrums O
, O
he O
was O
considered O
rather O
a B-PER
bad I-PER
man I-PER
; O
when O
they O
were O
pleased O
, O
he O
was O
rather O
a B-PER
good I-PER
man I-PER
; O
when O
they O
were O
neither O
, O
he O
was O
a B-PER
man I-PER
whose I-PER
moral I-PER
colour I-PER
was I-PER
a I-PER
kind I-PER
of I-PER
pepper-and-salt I-PER
mixture I-PER
. O
Since O
he O
lived O
six O
times O
as O
many O
working-days O
as O
Sundays O
, O
Oak B-PER
's O
appearance O
in O
his O
old O
clothes O
was O
most O
peculiarly O
his O
own O
-- O
the O
mental O
picture O
formed O
by O
his B-PER
neighbours I-PER
in O
imagining O
him O
being O
always O
dressed O
in O
that O
way O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
low-crowned O
felt O
hat O
, O
spread O
out O
at O
the O
base O
by O
tight O
jamming O
upon O
the O
head O
for O
security O
in O
high O
winds O
, O
and O
a O
coat O
like O
Dr. B-PER
Johnson O
's O
; O
his O
lower O
extremities O
being O
encased O
in O
ordinary O
leather O
leggings O
and O
boots O
emphatically O
large O
, O
affording O
to O
each O
foot O
a O
roomy O
apartment O
so O
constructed O
that O
any B-PER
wearer I-PER
might O
stand O
in O
a B-LOC
river I-LOC
all O
day O
long O
and O
know O
nothing O
of O
damp O
-- O
their B-PER
maker I-PER
being O
a B-PER
conscientious I-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
endeavoured I-PER
to I-PER
compensate I-PER
for I-PER
any I-PER
weakness I-PER
in I-PER
his I-PER
cut I-PER
by I-PER
unstinted I-PER
dimension I-PER
and I-PER
solidity I-PER
. O
Mr. B-PER
Oak O
carried O
about O
him O
, O
by O
way O
of O
watch O
, O
- O
what O
may O
be O
called O
a O
small O
silver O
clock O
; O
in O
other O
words O
, O
it O
was O
a O
watch O
as O
to O
shape O
and O
intention O
, O
and O
a O
small O
clock O
as O
to O
size O
. O
This O
instrument O
being O
several O
years O
older O
than O
Oak B-PER
's O
grandfather O
, O
had O
the O
peculiarity O
of O
going O
either O
too O
fast O
or O
not O
at O
all O
. O
The O
smaller O
of O
its O
hands O
, O
too O
, O
occasionally O
slipped O
round O
on O
the O
pivot O
, O
and O
thus O
, O
though O
the O
minutes O
were O
told O
with O
precision O
, O
nobody B-PER
could O
be O
quite O
certain O
of O
the O
hour O
they O
belonged O
to O
. O
The O
stopping O
peculiarity O
of O
his O
watch O
Oak B-PER
remedied O
by O
thumps O
and O
shakes O
, O
and O
he O
escaped O
any O
evil O
consequences O
from O
the O
other O
two O
defects O
by O
constant O
comparisons O
with O
and O
observations O
of O
the O
sun O
and O
stars O
, O
and O
by O
pressing O
his O
face O
close O
to O
the O
glass O
of O
his B-PER
neighbours I-PER
' O
windows O
, O
till O
he O
could O
discern O
the O
hour O
marked O
by O
the O
green-faced O
timekeepers O
within O
. O
It O
may O
be O
mentioned O
that O
Oak B-PER
's O
fob O
being O
difficult O
of O
access O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
its O
somewhat O
high O
situation O
in O
the O
waistband O
of O
his O
trousers O
( O
which O
also O
lay O
at O
a O
remote O
height O
under O
his O
waistcoat O
) O
, O
the O
watch O
was O
as O
a O
necessity O
pulled O
out O
by O
throwing O
the O
body O
to O
one O
side O
, O
compressing O
the O
mouth O
and O
face O
to O
a O
mere O
mass O
of O
ruddy O
flesh O
on O
account O
of O
the O
exertion O
, O
and O
drawing O
up O
the O
watch O
by O
its O
chain O
, O
like O
a O
bucket O
from O
a O
well O
. O
But O
some B-PER
thoughtfull I-PER
persons I-PER
, O
who O
had O
seen O
him O
walking O
across O
one O
of O
his B-LOC
fields I-LOC
on O
a O
certain O
December O
morning O
-- O
sunny O
and O
exceedingly O
mild O
-- O
might O
have O
regarded O
Gabriel B-PER
Oak I-PER
in O
other O
aspects O
than O
these O
. O
In O
his O
face O
one O
might O
notice O
that O
many O
of O
the O
hues O
and O
curves O
of O
youth O
had O
tarried O
on O
to O
manhood O
: O
there O
even O
remained O
in O
his O
remoter O
crannies O
some O
relics O
of O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
. O
His O
height O
and O
breadth O
would O
have O
been O
sufficient O
to O
make O
his O
presence O
imposing O
, O
had O
they O
been O
exhibited O
with O
due O
consideration O
. O
But O
there O
is O
a O
way O
some B-PER
men I-PER
have O
, O
rural O
and O
urban O
alike O
, O
for O
which O
the O
mind O
is O
more O
responsible O
than O
flesh O
and O
sinew O
: O
it O
is O
a O
way O
of O
curtail O
- O
ing O
their O
dimensions O
by O
their O
manner O
of O
showing O
them O
. O
And O
from O
a O
quiet O
modesty O
that O
would O
have O
become O
a O
vestal O
which O
seemed O
continually O
to O
impress O
upon O
him O
that O
he O
had O
no O
great O
claim O
on O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
's O
room O
, O
Oak B-PER
walked O
unassumingly O
and O
with O
a O
faintly O
perceptible O
bend O
, O
yet O
distinct O
from O
a O
bowing O
of O
the O
shoulders O
. O
This O
may O
be O
said O
to O
be O
a O
defect O
in O
an B-PER
individual I-PER
if O
he O
depends O
for O
his O
valuation O
more O
upon O
his O
appearance O
than O
upon O
his O
capacity O
to O
wear O
well O
, O
which O
Oak B-PER
did O
not O
. O
He O
had O
just O
reached O
the O
time O
of O
life O
at O
which O
" O
young O
" O
is O
ceasing O
to O
be O
the O
prefix O
of O
" O
man O
" O
in O
speaking O
of O
one O
. O
He O
was O
at O
the O
brightest O
period O
of O
masculine O
growth O
, O
for O
his O
intellect O
and O
his O
emotions O
were O
clearly O
separated O
: O
he O
had O
passed O
the O
time O
during O
which O
the O
influence O
of O
youth O
indiscriminately O
mingles O
them O
in O
the O
character O
of O
impulse O
, O
and O
he O
had O
not O
yet O
arrived O
at O
the O
stage O
wherein O
they O
become O
united O
again O
, O
in O
the O
character O
of O
prejudice O
, O
by O
the O
influence O
of O
a B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
family B-PER
. O
In O
short O
, O
he O
was O
twenty-eight O
, O
and O
a B-PER
bachelor I-PER
. O
The B-LOC
field I-LOC
he I-LOC
was I-LOC
in I-LOC
this I-LOC
morning I-LOC
sloped O
to O
a B-LOC
ridge I-LOC
called O
Norcombe B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
. O
Through O
a O
spur O
of O
this B-LOC
hill I-LOC
ran O
the O
highway O
between O
Emminster B-GPE
and O
Chalk B-GPE
- I-GPE
Newton I-GPE
. O
Casually O
glancing O
over O
the O
hedge O
, O
Oak B-PER
saw O
coming O
down O
the O
incline O
before O
him O
an B-VEH
ornamental I-VEH
spring I-VEH
waggon I-VEH
, I-VEH
painted I-VEH
yellow I-VEH
and I-VEH
gaily I-VEH
marked I-VEH
, I-VEH
drawn I-VEH
by I-VEH
two I-VEH
horses I-VEH
, O
a B-PER
waggoner I-PER
walking O
alongside O
bearing O
a O
whip O
perpendicularly O
. O
The B-VEH
waggon I-VEH
was O
laden O
with O
household O
goods O
and O
window O
plants O
, O
and O
on O
the O
apex O
of O
the O
whole O
sat O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
, I-PER
" I-PER
young I-PER
" I-PER
and I-PER
attractive I-PER
. O
Gabriel B-PER
had O
not O
beheld O
the O
sight O
for O
more O
than O
half O
a O
minute O
, O
when O
the B-VEH
vehicle I-VEH
was O
brought O
to O
a O
standstill O
just O
beneath O
his O
eyes O
. O
" O
The O
tailboard O
of O
the B-VEH
waggon I-VEH
is O
gone O
, O
Miss. B-PER
" O
said O
the B-PER
waggoner I-PER
. O
" O
Then O
I O
heard O
it O
fall O
. O
" O
said O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
, O
in O
a O
soft O
, O
though O
not O
particularly O
low O
voice O
. O
" O
I O
heard O
a O
noise O
I O
could O
not O
account O
for O
when O
we O
were O
coming O
up O
the B-LOC
hill I-LOC
. O
" O
" O
I O
'll O
run O
back O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
. O
" O
she O
answered O
. O
The O
sensible O
horses O
stood O
-- O
perfectly O
still O
, O
and O
the B-PER
waggoner I-PER
's O
steps O
sank O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
in O
the O
distance O
. O
The B-PER
girl I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
summit I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
load I-PER
sat O
motionless O
, O
surrounded O
by O
tables O
and O
chairs O
with O
their O
legs O
upwards O
, O
backed O
by O
an O
oak O
settle O
, O
and O
ornamented O
in O
front O
by O
pots O
of O
geraniums O
, O
myrtles O
, O
and O
cactuses O
, O
together O
with O
a O
caged O
canary O
-- O
all O
probably O
from O
the O
windows O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
just I-FAC
vacated I-FAC
. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
cat O
in O
a O
willow O
basket O
, O
from O
the O
partly-opened O
lid O
of O
which O
she O
gazed O
with O
half-closed O
eyes O
, O
and O
affectionately-surveyed O
the O
small O
birds O
around O
. O
The B-PER
handsome I-PER
girl I-PER
waited O
for O
some O
time O
idly O
in O
her O
place O
, O
and O
the O
only O
sound O
heard O
in O
the O
stillness O
was O
the O
hopping O
of O
the O
canary O
up-and O
down O
the O
perches O
of O
its O
prison O
. O
Then O
she O
looked O
attentively O
downwards O
. O
It O
was O
not O
at O
the O
bird O
, O

She O
turned O
her O
head O
to O
learn O
if O
the B-PER
waggoner I-PER

He O
was O
not O

and O
her-eyes O
crept O
back O
to O
the O
package O

her O
thoughts O
seeming O
to O
run O
upon O
what O
was O
inside O
it O

At O

she O
drew O
the O

untied O
the O

a O
small O

It O
was O
a O
fine O
morning O

the O
sun O
lighted O
up O
to O
a O
scarlet O

the O
crimson O

she O
wore O

painted O
a O
soft O

upon O
her O

The O
myrtles O
, O
geraniums O

cactuses O
packed O
around O
her O
were O
fresh O

green O

at O
such O
a O
leafless O

they O
invested O
the O
whole O

of O

with O
a O
peculiar O

What O
possessed O
her O
to O
indulge O
in O
such O
a O
performance O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
sparrows O

and O
unperceived B-PER
farmer I-PER
who O
were O
alone O
its O
spectators O

whether O
the O
smile O
began O
as O
a O
factitious O
one O
, O
to O
test O
her O
capacity O
in O
that O
art O
, O
-- O
nobody B-PER
knows O
; O
it O
ended O
certainly O
in O
a O
real O
smile O

She O
blushed O
at O
herself O
, O
and O
seeing O
her O
reflection O
blush O
, O
blushed O
the O
more O

The O
change O
from O
the O
customary O
spot O

necessary O
occasion O
of O
such O
an O
act O
-- O
from O
the O
dressing O

in O

to O
a O
time O
of O

out O

lent O
to O
the O
idle O

The O

was O
a O
delicate O
one O

Woman B-PER
's O
prescriptive O
infirmity O
had O
stalked O
into O
the O
sunlight O
, O
which O
had O
clothed O
it O
in O
the O
freshness O
of O
an O
originality O
. O
A O
cynical O
inference O
was O
irresistible O
by O
Gabriel B-PER
Oak I-PER
as O
he O
regarded O
the O
scene O
, O
generous O
though O
he O
fain O
would O
have O
been O
. O
There O
was O
no O
necessity O
whatever O
for O
her O
looking O
in O
the O
glass O

She O
did O
not O
adjust O
her O
hat O

or O
pat O
her O

or O
press O
a O
dimple O
into O

or O
do O
one O

to O
signify O
that O
any O
such O
intention O
had O
been O
her O
motive O
in O
taking O
up O
the O
glass O
. O
She O
simply O
observed O
herself O
as O
a O
fair O
product O
of O
Nature B-LOC
in O
the O
feminine O
kind O
, O
her O
thoughts O
seeming O
to O
glide O
into O
far-off O
though O
likely O
dramas O
in O
which O
men B-PER
would O
play O
a O
part O
-- O
vistas O
of O
probable O
triumphs O
-- O
the O
smiles O
being O
of O
a O
phase O
suggesting O
that O
hearts O
were O
imagined O
as O
lost O
and O
won O
. O
Still O
, O
this O
was O
but O
conjecture O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
series O
of O
actions O
was O
so O
idly O
put O
forth O
as O
to O
make O
it O
rash O
to O
assert O
that O
intention O
had O
any O
part O
in O
them O
at O
all O
. O
The B-PER
waggoner I-PER
's O
steps O
were O
heard O
returning O
. O
She O
put O
the O
glass O
in O
the O
paper O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
again O
into O
its O
place O
. O
When O
the B-VEH
waggon I-VEH
had O
passed O
on O
, O
Gabriel B-PER
withdrew O
from O
his O
point O
of O
espial O
, O
and O
descending O
into O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
, O
followed O
the B-VEH
vehicle I-VEH
to O
the O
turnpike-gate O
some O
way O
beyond O
the O
bottom O
of O
the B-LOC
hill I-LOC
, O
where O
the O
object O
of O
his O
contemplation O
now O
halted O
for O
the O
payment O
of O
toll O
. O
About O
twenty O
steps O
still O
remained O
between O
him O
and O
the O
gate O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
a O
dispute O
. O
lt O
was O
a O
difference O
con O
- O
cerning O
twopence O
between O
the O
persons O
with O

said O
the B-PER
turnpike-keeper I-PER
, O
closing O
the O
gate O
. O
Oak B-PER
looked O
from O
one B-PER
to O
the O
other O
of O
the B-PER
disputants I-PER
, O
and O
fell O
into O
a O
reverie O
. O
There O
was O
something O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
twopence O
remarkably O
insignificant O
. O
Threepence O
had O
a O
definite O
value O
as O
money O
-- O
it O
was O
an O
appreciable O
infringement O
on O
a O
day O

, O
as O
such O
, O
a O
higgling O
matter O

he O
said O

stepping O

" O

the B-PER
young I-PER

He O
looked O
up O
at O
her O
then O
; O
she O
heard O
his O
words O
, O
and O
looked O
down O
. O
Gabriel B-PER
's O
features O
adhered O
throughout O
their O
form O
so O
exactly O
to O
the O
middle O
line O
between O
the O
beauty O
of O
St. B-PER
John O
and O
the O
ugliness O
of O
Judas B-PER
Iscariot I-PER
, O
as O
represented O
in O
a O
window O
of O
the B-FAC
church I-FAC
he I-FAC
attended I-FAC
, O
that O
not O
a O
single O
lineament O
could O
be O
selected O

called O
worthy O
either O
of O
distinction O
or O
notoriety O
. O
The B-PER
redjacketed I-PER
and I-PER
dark I-PER
- I-PER
haired I-PER
maiden I-PER
seemed O
to O
think O
so O
too O
, O
for O
she O
carelessly O
glanced O
over O
him O
, O
and O
told O
her B-PER
man I-PER
to O

She O
might O
have O
looked O

Gabriel B-PER

a O
minute O

but O
she O
did O
not O

more O
probably O
she O
felt O
none O

her O

I O
ANTHONY B-PER
PATCH I-PER
In O
1913 O
, O
when O
Anthony B-PER
Patch I-PER
was O
twenty-five O
, O
two O
years O
were O
already O
gone O
since O
irony O
, O
the O
Holy O
Ghost O
of O
this O
later O
day O
, O
had O
, O
theoretically O
at O
least O
, O
descended O
upon O
him O
. O
Irony O
was O
the O
final O
polish O
of O
the O
shoe O
, O
the O
ultimate O
dab O
of O
the O
clothes-brush O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
intellectual O
" O
There O
! O
" O
-- O
yet O
at O
the O
brink O
of O
this O
story O
he O
has O
as O
yet O
gone O
no O
further O
than O
the O
conscious O
stage O
. O
As O
you O
first O
see O
him O
he O
wonders O
frequently O
whether O
he O
is O
not O
without O
honor O
and O
slightly O
mad O
, O
a O
shameful O
and O
obscene O
thinness O
glistening O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
like O
oil O
on O
a B-LOC
clean I-LOC
pond I-LOC
, O
these O
occasions O
being O
varied O
, O
of O
course O
, O
with O
those O
in O
which O
he O
thinks O
himself O
rather O
an B-PER
exceptional I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, O
thoroughly O
sophisticated O
, O
well O
adjusted O
to O
his O
environment O
, O
and O
somewhat O
more O
significant O
than O
any B-PER
one I-PER
else I-PER
he I-PER
knows I-PER
. O
This O
was O
his O
healthy O
state O
and O
it O
made O
him O
cheerful O
, O
pleasant O
, O
and O
very O
attractive O
to O
intelligent B-PER
men I-PER
and O
to O
all B-PER
women I-PER
. O
In O
this O
state O
he O
considered O
that O
he O
would O
one O
day O
accomplish O
some O
quiet O
subtle O
thing O
that O
the B-PER
elect I-PER
would O
deem O
worthy O
and O
, O
passing O
on O
, O
would O
join O
the O
dimmer O
stars O
in O
a O
nebulous O
, O
indeterminate O
heaven O
half-way O
between O
death O
and O
immortality O
. O
Until O
the O
time O
came O
for O
this O
effort O
he O
would O
be O
Anthony B-PER
Patch I-PER
-- O
not O
a O
portrait O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
but O
a B-PER
distinct I-PER
and I-PER
dynamic I-PER
personality I-PER
, O
opinionated O
, O
contemptuous O
, O
functioning O
from O
within O
outward O
-- O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
aware I-PER
that I-PER
there I-PER
could I-PER
be I-PER
no I-PER
honor I-PER
and I-PER
yet I-PER
had I-PER
honor I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
knew I-PER
the I-PER
sophistry I-PER
of I-PER
courage I-PER
and I-PER
yet I-PER
was I-PER
brave I-PER
. O
A B-PER
WORTHY I-PER
MAN I-PER
AND O
HIS B-PER
GIFTED I-PER
SON I-PER
Anthony B-PER
drew O
as O
much O
consciousness O
of O
social O
security O
from O
being O
the O
grandson O
of O
Adam B-PER
J. I-PER
Patch I-PER
as O
he O
would O
have O
had O
from O
tracing O
his O
line O
over O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
to O
the B-PER
crusaders I-PER
. O
This O
is O
inevitable O
; O
Virginians B-PER
and O
Bostonians B-PER
to O
the O
contrary O
notwithstanding O
, O
an O
aristocracy O
founded O
sheerly O
on O
money O
postulates O
wealth O
in O
the O
particular O
. O
Now O
Adam B-PER
J. I-PER
Patch I-PER
, O
more O
familiarly O
known O
as O
" O
Cross B-PER
Patch I-PER
, O
" O
left O
his B-PER
father I-PER
's O
farm O
in O
Tarrytown B-GPE
early O
in O
sixty-one O
to O
join O
a O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
cavalry I-ORG
regiment I-ORG
. O
He O
came O
home B-FAC
from O
the O
war O
a B-PER
major I-PER
, O
charged O
into O
Wall B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
and O
amid O
much O
fuss O
, O
fume O
, O
applause O
, O
and O
ill O
will O
he O
gathered O
to O
himself O
some O
seventy-five O
million O
dollars O
. O
This O
occupied O
his O
energies O
until O
he O
was O
fifty-seven O
years O
old O
. O
It O
was O
then O
that O
he O
determined O
, O
after O
a O
severe O
attack O
of O
sclerosis O
, O
to O
consecrate O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
life O
to O
the O
moral O
regeneration O
of O
the B-PER
world I-PER
. O
He O
became O
a O
reformer O
among O
reformers B-PER
. O
Emulating O
the O
magnificent O
efforts O
of O
Anthony O
Comstock O
, O
after O
whom O
his B-PER
grandson I-PER
was O
named O
, O
he O
levelled O
a O
varied O
assortment O
of O
uppercuts O
and O
body-blows O
at O
liquor O
, O
literature O
, O
vice O
, O
art O
, O
patent O
medicines O
, O
and O
Sunday O
theatres O
. O
His O
mind O
, O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
that O
insidious O
mildew O
which O
eventually O
forms O
on O
all O
but O
the O
few O
, O
gave O
itself O
up O
furiously O
to O
every O
indignation O
of O
the O
age O
. O
From O
an O
armchair O
in O
the O
office O
of O
his O
Tarrytown B-GPE
estate O
he O
directed O
against O
the O
enormous O
hypothetical O
enemy O
, O
unrighteousness O
, O
a O
campaign O
which O
went O
on O
through O
fifteen O
years O
, O
during O
which O
he O
displayed O
himself O
a B-PER
rabid I-PER
monomaniac I-PER
, O
an B-PER
unqualified I-PER
nuisance I-PER
, O
and O
an B-PER
intolerable I-PER
bore I-PER
. O
The O
year O
in O
which O
this O
story O
opens O
found O
him O
wearying O
; O
his O
campaign O
had O
grown O
desultory O
; O
1861 O
was O
creeping O
up O
slowly O
on O
1895 O
; O
his O
thoughts O
ran O
a O
great O
deal O
on O
the O
Civil O
War O
, O
somewhat O
on O
his O
dead B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
son B-PER
, O
almost O
infinitesimally O
on O
his B-PER
grandson I-PER
Anthony B-PER
. O
Early O
in O
his O
career O
Adam B-PER
Patch I-PER
had O
married O
an B-PER
anemic I-PER
lady I-PER
of I-PER
thirty I-PER

Alicia B-PER

who O
brought O
him O
one O
hundred O
thousand O

an O
impeccable O
entré O
into O
the O

circles O
of O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O
Immediately O
and O
rather O
spunkily O
she O
had O
borne O
him O
a B-PER
son I-PER
and O
, O
as O
if O
completely O
devitalized O
by O
the O
magnificence O
of O
this O
performance O
, O
she O
had O
thenceforth O
effaced O
herself O
within O
the O
shadowy O
dimensions O
of O
the B-FAC

The B-PER

so O
often O
had O
it O
faced O
his O
eyes O
in O
childhood O
that O
it O
had O
acquired O
the O
impersonality O
of O
furniture O
, O
but O
every O
one O
who O
came O
into O
his B-FAC
bedroom I-FAC
regarded O
it O
with O
interest O
. O
It O
showed O
a B-PER
dandy I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
nineties I-PER
, I-PER
spare I-PER
and I-PER
handsome I-PER
, O
standing O
beside O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
dark I-PER
lady I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
muff I-PER
and I-PER
the I-PER
suggestion I-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
bustle I-PER
. O
Between O
them O
was O
a O
little O
boy O
with O
long O
brown O
curls O
, O
dressed O
in O
a O
velvet O
Lord B-PER
Fauntleroy O
suit O
. O
This O
was O
Anthony B-PER
at O
five O
, O
the O
year O
of O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
death O
. O
His O
memories O
of O
the O
Boston B-GPE
Society O
Contralto O
were O
nebulous O
and O
musical O
. O
She O
was O
a O
lady O
who O
sang O
, O
sang O
, O
sang O
, O
in O
the O
music O
room O
of O
their O
house O
on O
Washington B-FAC
Square I-FAC
-- O
sometimes O
with O
guests B-PER
scattered I-PER
all I-PER
about I-PER
her I-PER
, O
the O
men B-PER
with I-PER
their I-PER
arms I-PER
folded I-PER
, I-PER
balanced I-PER
breathlessly I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
edges I-PER
of I-PER
sofas I-PER
, O
the B-PER
women I-PER
with I-PER
their I-PER
hands I-PER
in I-PER
their I-PER
laps I-PER
, O
occasionally O
making O
little O
whispers O
to O
the B-PER
men I-PER
and O
always O
clapping O
very O
briskly O
and O
uttering O
cooing O
cries O
after O
each O
song O
-- O
and O
often O
she O
sang O
to O
Anthony B-PER
alone O
, O
in O
Italian O
or O
French O
or O
in O
a O
strange O
and O
terrible O
dialect O
which O
she O
imagined O
to O
be O
the O
speech O
of O
the B-PER
Southern I-PER
negro I-PER
. O
His O
recollections O
of O
the B-PER
gallant I-PER
Ulysses I-PER
, O
the O
first O
man O
in O
America B-GPE
to O
roll O
the O
lapels O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
were O
much O
more O
vivid O
. O
After O
Henrietta B-PER
Lebrune I-PER
Patch I-PER
had O
" O
joined O
another B-ORG
choir I-ORG
, O
" O
as O
her B-PER
widower I-PER
huskily O
remarked O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
father B-PER
and O
son B-PER
lived O
up O
at O
grampa O
's O
in O
Tarrytown B-GPE
, O
and O
Ulysses B-PER
came O
daily O
to O
Anthony B-PER
's O
nursery O
and O
expelled O
pleasant O
, O
thick-smelling O
words O
for O
sometimes O
as O
much O
as O
an O
hour O
. O
He O
was O
continually O
promising O
Anthony B-PER
hunting O
trips O
and O
fishing O
trips O
and O
excursions O
to O
Atlantic B-GPE
City I-GPE
, O
" O
oh O
, O
some O
time O
soon O
now O
" O
; O
but O
none O
of O
them O
ever O
materialized O
. O
One O
trip O
they O
did O
take O
; O
when O
Anthony B-PER
was O
eleven O
they O
went O
abroad O
, O
to O
England B-GPE
and O
Switzerland B-GPE
, O
and O
there B-GPE
in O
the O
best O
hotel O
in O
Lucerne B-GPE
his B-PER
father I-PER
died O
with O
much O
sweating O
and O
grunting O
and O
crying O
aloud O
for O
air O
. O
In O
a O
panic O
of O
despair O
and O
terror O
Anthony B-PER
was O
brought O
back O
to O
America B-GPE
, O
wedded O
to O
a O
vague O
melancholy O
that O
was O
to O
stay O
beside O
him O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
. O
PAST O
AND O
PERSON O
OF O
THE B-PER
HERO I-PER
At O
eleven O
he O
had O
a O
horror O
of O
death O
. O
Within O
six O
impressionable O
years O
his B-PER
parents I-PER
had O
died O
and O
his B-PER
grandmother I-PER
had O
faded O
off O
almost O
imperceptibly O
, O
until O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
her O
marriage O
, O
her B-PER
person I-PER
held O
for O
one O
day O
an O
unquestioned O
supremacy O
over O
her B-FAC
own I-FAC
drawing I-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
So O
to O
Anthony B-PER
life O
was O
a O
struggle O
against O
death O
, O
that O
waited O
at O
every B-FAC
corner I-FAC
. O
It O
was O
as O
a O
concession O
to O
his O
hypochondriacal O
imagination O
that O
he O
formed O
the O
habit O
of O
reading O
in O
bed O
-- O
it O
soothed O
him O
. O
He O
read O
until O
he O
was O
tired O
and O
often O
fell O
asleep O
with O
the O
lights O
still O
on O
. O
His O
favorite O
diversion O
until O
he O
was O
fourteen O
was O
his O
stamp O
collection O
; O
enormous O
, O
as O
nearly O
exhaustive O
as O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
's O
could O
be O
-- O
his B-PER
grandfather I-PER
considered O
fatuously O
that O
it O
was O
teaching O
him O
geography O
. O
So O
Anthony B-PER
kept O
up O
a O
correspondence O
with O
a B-ORG
half I-ORG
dozen I-ORG
" I-ORG
Stamp I-ORG
and I-ORG
Coin I-ORG
" I-ORG
companies I-ORG
and O
it O
was O
rare O
that O
the O
mail O
failed O
to O
bring O
him O
new O
stamp-books O
or O
packages O
of O
glittering O
approval O
sheets O
-- O
there O
was O
a O
mysterious O
fascination O
in O
transferring O
his O
acquisitions O
interminably O
from O
one O
book O
to O
another O
. O
His O
stamps O
were O
his O
greatest O
happiness O
and O
he O
bestowed O
impatient O
frowns O
on O
any B-PER
one I-PER
who I-PER
interrupted I-PER
him I-PER
at I-PER
play I-PER
with O
them O
; O
they O
devoured O
his O
allowance O
every O
month O
, O
and O
he O
lay O
awake O
at O
night O
musing O
untiringly O
on O
their O
variety O
and O
many-colored O
splendor O
. O
At O
sixteen O
he O
had O
lived O
almost O
entirely O
within O
himself O
, O
an B-PER
inarticulate I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
thoroughly O
un-American O
, O
and O
politely O
bewildered O
by O
his B-PER
contemporaries I-PER
. O
The O
two O
preceding O
years O
had O
been O
spent O
in O
Europe B-GPE
with O
a O
private O
tutor O
, O
who O
persuaded O
him O
that O
Harvard B-ORG
was O
the O
thing O
; O
it O
would O
" O
open O
doors O
, O
" O
it O
would O
be O
a O
tremendous O
tonic O
, O
it O
would O
give O
him O
innumerable B-PER
self-sacrificing I-PER
and I-PER
devoted I-PER
friends I-PER
. O
So O
he O
went O
to O
Harvard B-ORG
-- O
there O
was O
no O
other O
logical O
thing O
to O
be O
done O
with O
him O
. O
Oblivious O
to O
the O
social O
system O
, O
he O
lived O
for O
a O
while O
alone O
and O
unsought O
in O
a O
high O
room O
in O
Beck B-FAC
Hall I-FAC
-- O
a B-PER
slim I-PER
dark I-PER
boy I-PER
of I-PER
medium I-PER
height I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
shy I-PER
sensitive I-PER
mouth I-PER
. O
His O
allowance O
was O
more O
than O
liberal O
. O
He O
laid O
the O
foundations O
for O
a B-FAC
library I-FAC
by O
purchasing O
from O
a O
wandering O
bibliophile B-PER
first O
editions O
of O
Swinburne B-PER
, O
Meredith B-PER
, O
and O
Hardy B-PER
, O
and O
a O
yellowed O
illegible O
autograph O
letter O
of O
Keats B-PER
's O
, O
finding O
later O
that O
he O
had O
been O
amazingly O
overcharged O
. O
He O
became O
an B-PER
exquisite I-PER
dandy I-PER
, O
amassed O
a O
rather O
pathetic O
collection O
of O
silk O
pajamas O
, O
brocaded O
dressing-gowns O
, O
and O
neckties O
too O
flamboyant O
to O
wear O
; O
in O
this O
secret O
finery O
he O
would O
parade O
before O
a O
mirror O
in O
his B-FAC
room I-FAC
or O
lie O
stretched O
in O
satin O
along O
his O
window-seat O
looking O
down O
on O
the B-FAC
yard I-FAC
and O
realizing O
dimly O
this O
clamor O
, O
breathless O
and O
immediate O
, O
in O
which O
it O
seemed O
he O
was O
never O
to O
have O
a O
part O
. O
Curiously O
enough O
he O
found O
in O
senior O
year O
that O
he O
had O
acquired O
a O
position O
in O
his B-PER
class I-PER
. O
He O
learned O
that O
he O
was O
looked O
upon O
as O
a B-PER
rather I-PER
romantic I-PER
figure I-PER
, O
a B-PER
scholar I-PER
, O
a B-PER
recluse I-PER
, O
a B-PER
tower I-PER
of I-PER
erudition I-PER
. O
This O
amused O
him O
but O
secretly O
pleased O
him O
-- O
he O
began O
going O
out O
, O
at O
first O
a O
little O
and O
then O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
He O
made O
the O
Pudding O
. O
He O
drank O
-- O
quietly O
and O
in O
the O
proper O
tradition O
. O
It O
was O
said O
of O
him O
that O
had O
he O
not O
come O
to O
college B-ORG
so O
young O
he O
might O
have O
" O
done O
extremely O
well O
. O
" O
In O
1909 O
, O
when O
he O
graduated O
, O
he O
was O
only O
twenty O
years O
old O
. O
Then O
abroad O
again O
-- O
to O
Rome B-GPE
this O
time O
, O
where O
he O
dallied O
with O
architecture O
and O
painting O
in O
turn O
, O
took O
up O
the O
violin O
, O
and O
wrote O
some O
ghastly O
Italian O
sonnets O
, O
supposedly O
the O
ruminations O
of O
a B-PER
thirteenth-century I-PER
monk I-PER
on O
the O
joys O
of O
the O
contemplative O
life O
. O
It O
became O
established O
among O
his B-PER
Harvard I-PER
intimates I-PER
that O
he O
was O
in O
Rome B-GPE
, O
and O
those B-PER
of I-PER
them I-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
abroad I-PER
that I-PER
year I-PER
looked O
him O
up O
and O
discovered O
with O
him O
, O
on O
many O
moonlight O
excursions O
, O
much O
in O
the B-GPE
city I-GPE
that O
was O
older O
than O
the O
Renaissance O
or O
indeed O
than O
the O
republic O
. O
Maury O
Noble O
, O
from O
Philadelphia B-GPE
, O
for O
instance O
, O
remained O
two O
months O
, O
and O
together O
they O
realized O
the O
peculiar O
charm O
of O
Latin B-PER
women I-PER
and O
had O
a O
delightful O
sense O
of O
being O
very O
young O
and O
free O
in O
a B-PER
civilization I-PER
that I-PER
was I-PER
very I-PER
old I-PER
and I-PER
free I-PER
. O
Not O
a O
few O
acquaintances O
of O
his B-PER
grandfather I-PER
's O
called O
on O
him O
, O
and O
had O
he O
so O
desired O
he O
might O
have O
been O
_ O
persona O
grata O
_ O
with O
the O
diplomatic O
set O
-- O
indeed O
, O
he O
found O
that O
his O
inclinations O
tended O
more O
and O
more O
toward O
conviviality O
, O
but O
that O
long O
adolescent O
aloofness O
and O
consequent O
shyness O
still O
dictated O
to O
his O
conduct O
. O
CHAPTER O
I O
. O
YOU O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
me O
without O
you O
have O
read O
a O
book O
by O
the O
name O
of O
The O
Adventures O
of O
Tom B-PER
Sawyer I-PER
; O
but O
that O
ai O
n't O
no O
matter O
. O
That O
book O
was O
made O
by O
Mr. B-PER
Mark O
Twain O
, O
and O
he O
told O
the O
truth O
, O
mainly O
. O
There O
was O
things O
which O
he O
stretched O
, O
but O
mainly O
he O
told O
the O
truth O
. O
That O
is O
nothing O
. O
I O
never O
seen O
anybody B-PER
but O
lied O
one O
time O
or O
another O
, O
without O
it O
was O
Aunt B-PER
Polly O
, O
or O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
, O
or O
maybe O
Mary B-PER
. O
Aunt B-PER
Polly O
-- O
Tom B-PER
's O
Aunt B-PER
Polly O
, O
she O
is O
-- O
and O
Mary B-PER
, O
and O
the O
Widow B-PER
Douglas I-PER
is O
all O
told O
about O
in O
that O
book O
, O
which O
is O
mostly O
a O
true O
book O
, O
with O
some O
stretchers O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
. O
Now O
the O
way O
that O
the O
book O
winds O
up O
is O
this O
: O
Tom B-PER
and O
me O
found O
the O
money O
that O
the B-PER
robbers I-PER
hid O
in O
the B-LOC
cave I-LOC
, O
and O
it O
made O
us O
rich O
. O
We O
got O
six O
thousand O
dollars O
apiece O
-- O
all O
gold O
. O
It O
was O
an O
awful O
sight O
of O
money O
when O
it O
was O
piled O
up O
. O
Well O
, O
Judge B-PER
Thatcher O
he O
took O
it O
and O
put O
it O
out O
at O
interest O
, O
and O
it O
fetched O
us O
a O
dollar O
a O
day O
apiece O
all O
the O
year O
round O
-- O
more O
than O
a O
body O
could O
tell O
what O
to O
do O
with O
. O
The B-PER
Widow I-PER
Douglas B-PER
she O
took O
me O
for O
her B-PER
son I-PER
, O
and O
allowed O
she O
would O
sivilize O
me O
; O
but O
it O
was O
rough O
living O
in O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
all O
the O
time O
, O
considering O
how O
dismal O
regular O
and O
decent O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
was O
in O
all O
her O
ways O
; O
and O
so O
when O
I O
could O
n't O
stand O
it O
no O
longer O
I O
lit O
out O
. O
I O
got O
into O
my O
old O
rags O
and O
my O
sugar-hogshead O
again O
, O
and O
was O
free O
and O
satisfied O
. O
But O
Tom B-PER
Sawyer I-PER
he O
hunted O
me O
up O
and O
said O
he O
was O
going O
to O
start O
a O
band O
of O
robbers B-PER
, O
and O
I O
might O
join O
if O
I O
would O
go O
back O
to O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
and O
be O
respectable O
. O
So O
I O
went O
back O
. O
The B-PER
widow I-PER
she O
cried O
over O
me O
, O
and O
called O
me O
a O
poor O
lost O
lamb O
, O
and O
she O
called O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
names O
, O
too O
, O
but O
she O
never O
meant O
no O
harm O
by O
it O
. O
She O
put O
me O
in O
them O
new O
clothes O
again O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
do O
nothing O
but O
sweat O
and O
sweat O
, O
and O
feel O
all O
cramped O
up O
. O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
the O
old O
thing O
commenced O
again O
. O
The B-PER
widow I-PER
rung O
a O
bell O
for O
supper O
, O
and O
you O
had O
to O
come O
to O
time O
. O
When O
you O
got O
to O
the O
table O
you O
could O
n't O
go O
right O
to O
eating O
, O
but O
you O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
to O
tuck O
down O
her O
head O
and O
grumble O
a O
little O
over O
the O
victuals O
, O
though O
there O
war O
n't O
really O
anything O
the O
matter O
with O
them O
, O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
nothing O
only O
everything O
was O
cooked O
by O
itself O
. O
In O
a O
barrel O
of O
odds O
and O
ends O
it O
is O
different O
; O
things O
get O
mixed O
up O
, O
and O
the O
juice O
kind O
of O
swaps O
around O
, O
and O
the O
things O
go O
better O
. O
After O
supper O
she O
got O
out O
her O
book O
and O
learned O
me O
about O
Moses B-PER
and O
the B-PER
Bulrushers I-PER
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
a O
sweat O
to O
find O
out O
all O
about O
him O
; O
but O
by O
and O
by O
she O
let O
it O
out O
that O
Moses B-PER
had O
been O
dead O
a O
considerable O
long O
time O
; O
so O
then O
I O
did O
n't O
care O
no O
more O
about O
him O
, O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
take O
no O
stock O
in O
dead B-PER
people I-PER
. O
Pretty O
soon O
I O
wanted O
to O
smoke O
, O
and O
asked O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
to O
let O
me O
. O
But O
she O
would O
n't O
. O
She O
said O
it O
was O
a O
mean O
practice O
and O
was O
n't O
clean O
, O
and O
I O
must O
try O
to O
not O
do O
it O
any O
more O
. O
That O
is O
just O
the O
way O
with O
some B-PER
people I-PER
. O
They O
get O
down O
on O
a O
thing O
when O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O
Here O
she O
was O
a-bothering O
about O
Moses O
, O
which O
was O
no O
kin O
to O
her O
, O
and O
no O
use O
to O
anybody B-PER
, O
being O
gone O
, O
you O
see O
, O
yet O
finding O
a O
power O
of O
fault O
with O
me O
for O
doing O
a O
thing O
that O
had O
some O
good O
in O
it O
. O
And O
she O
took O
snuff O
, O
too O
; O
of O
course O
that O
was O
all O
right O
, O
because O
she O
done O
it O
herself O
. O
Her O
sister O
, O
Miss B-PER
Watson O
, O
a B-PER
tolerable I-PER
slim I-PER
old I-PER
maid I-PER
, O
with O
goggles O
on O
, O
had O
just O
come O
to O
live O
with O
her O
, O
and O
took O
a O
set O
at O
me O
now O
with O
a O
spelling-book O
. O
She O
worked O
me O
middling O
hard O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
then O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
made O
her O
ease O
up O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
stood O
it O
much O
longer O
. O
Then O
for O
an O
hour O
it O
was O
deadly O
dull O
, O
and O
I O
was O
fidgety O
. O
Miss B-PER
Watson O
would O
say O
, O
“ O
Do O
n't O
put O
your O
feet O
up O
there O
, O
Huckleberry B-PER
; O
” O
and O
“ O
Do O
n't O
scrunch O
up O
like O
that O
, O
Huckleberry B-PER
-- O
set O
up O
straight O
; O
” O
and O
pretty O
soon O
she O
would O
say O
, O
“ O
Do O
n't O
gap O
and O
stretch O
like O
that O
, O
Huckleberry B-PER
-- O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
try O
to O
behave O
? O
” O
Then O
she O
told O
me O
all O
about O
the B-LOC
bad I-LOC
place I-LOC
, O
and O
I O
said O
I O
wished O
I O
was O
there B-LOC
. O
She O
got O
mad O
then O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
mean O
no O
harm O
. O
All O
I O
wanted O
was O
to O
go O
somewheres O
; O
all O
I O
wanted O
was O
a O
change O
, O
I O
war O
n't O
particular O
. O
She O
said O
it O
was O
wicked O
to O
say O
what O
I O
said O
; O
said O
she O
would O
n't O
say O
it O
for O
the B-LOC
whole I-LOC
world I-LOC
; O
she O
was O
going O
to O
live O
so O
as O
to O
go O
to O
the B-LOC
good I-LOC
place I-LOC
. O
Well O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
no O
advantage O
in O
going O
where O
she O
was O
going O
, O
so O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
I O
would O
n't O
try O
for O
it O
. O
But O
I O
never O
said O
so O
, O
because O
it O
would O
only O
make O
trouble O
, O
and O
would O
n't O
do O
no O
good O
. O
Now O
she O
had O
got O
a O
start O
, O
and O
she O
went O
on O
and O
told O
me O
all O
about O
the B-LOC
good I-LOC
place I-LOC
. O
She O
said O
all O
a B-PER
body I-PER
would O
have O
to O
do O
there B-LOC
was O
to O
go O
around O
all O
day O
long O
with O
a O
harp O
and O
sing O
, O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O
So O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
much O
of O
it O
. O
But O
I O
never O
said O
so O
. O
I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
reckoned O
Tom B-PER
Sawyer I-PER
would O
go O
there B-LOC
, O
and O
she O
said O
not O
by O
a O
considerable O
sight O
. O
I O
was O
glad O
about O
that O
, O
because O
I O
wanted O
him O
and O
me O
to O
be O
together O
. O
Miss B-PER
Watson O
she O
kept O
pecking O
at O
me O
, O
and O
it O
got O
tiresome O
and O
lonesome O
. O
By O
and O
by O
they O
fetched O
the B-PER
niggers I-PER
in O
and O
had O
prayers O
, O
and O
then O
everybody B-PER
was O
off O
to O
bed O
. O
I O
went O
up O
to O
my B-FAC
room I-FAC
with O
a O
piece O
of O
candle O
, O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
table O
. O
Then O
I O
set O
down O
in O
a O
chair O
by O
the O
window O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
something O
cheerful O
, O
but O
it O
war O
n't O
no O
use O
. O
I O
felt O
so O
lonesome O
I O
most O
wished O
I O
was O
dead O
. O
The O
stars O
were O
shining O
, O
and O
the O
leaves O
rustled O
in O
the O
woods O
ever O
so O
mournful O
; O
and O
I O
heard O
an O
owl O
, O
away O
off O
, O
who-whooing O
about O
somebody B-PER
that I-PER
was I-PER
dead I-PER
, O
and O
a O
whippowill O
and O
a O
dog O
crying O
about O
somebody B-PER
that I-PER
was I-PER
going I-PER
to I-PER
die I-PER
; O
and O
the O
wind O
was O
trying O
to O
whisper O
something O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
make O
out O
what O
it O
was O
, O
and O
so O
it O
made O
the O
cold O
shivers O
run O
over O
me O
. O
Then O
away O
out O
in O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
I O
heard O
that O
kind O
of O
a O
sound O
that O
a O
ghost O
makes O
when O
it O
wants O
to O
tell O
about O
something O
that O
's O
on O
its O
mind O
and O
ca O
n't O
make O
itself O
understood O
, O
and O
so O
ca O
n't O
rest O
easy O
in O
its O
grave B-FAC
, O
and O
has O
to O
go O
about O
that O
way O
every O
night O
grieving O
. O
I O
got O
so O
down-hearted O
and O
scared O
I O
did O
wish O
I O
had O
some B-PER
company I-PER
. O
Pretty O
soon O
a O
spider O
went O
crawling O
up O
my O
shoulder O
, O
and O
I O
flipped O
it O
off O
and O
it O
lit O
in O
the O
candle O
; O
and O
before O
I O
could O
budge O
it O
was O
all O
shriveled O
up O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
anybody B-PER
to O
tell O
me O
that O
that O
was O
an O
awful O
bad O
sign O
and O
would O
fetch O
me O
some O
bad O
luck O
, O
so O
I O
was O
scared O
and O
most O
shook O
the O
clothes O
off O
of O
me O
. O
I O
got O
up O
and O
turned O
around O
in O
my O
tracks O
three O
times O
and O
crossed O
my O
breast O
every O
time O
; O
and O
then O
I O
tied O
up O
a O
little O
lock O
of O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
thread O
to O
keep O
witches B-PER
away O
. O
But O
I O
had O
n't O
no O
confidence O
. O
You O
do O
that O
when O
you O
've O
lost O
a O
horseshoe O
that O
you O
've O
found O
, O
instead O
of O
nailing O
it O
up O
over O
the O
door O
, O
but O
I O
had O
n't O
ever O
heard O
anybody B-PER
say O
it O
was O
any O
way O
to O
keep O
off O
bad O
luck O
when O
you O
'd O
killed O
a O
spider O
. O
I O
set O
down O
again O
, O
a-shaking O
all O
over O
, O
and O
got O
out O
my O
pipe O
for O
a O
smoke O
; O
for O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
was O
all O
as O
still O
as O
death O
now O
, O
and O
so O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
would O
n't O
know O
. O
Well O
, O
after O
a O
long O
time O
I O
heard O
the O
clock O
away O
off O
in O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
go O
boom O
-- O
boom O
-- O
boom O
-- O
twelve O
licks O
; O
and O
all O
still O
again O
-- O
stiller O
than O
ever O
. O
Pretty O
soon O
I O
heard O
a O
twig O
snap O
down O
in O
the O
dark O
amongst O
the O
trees O
-- O
something O
was O
a O
stirring O
. O
I O
set O
still O
and O
listened O
. O
Directly O
I O
could O
just O
barely O
hear O
a O
“ O
me-yow O
! O
me-yow O
! O
” O
down O
there O
. O
That O
was O
good O
! O
Says O
I O
, O
“ O
me-yow O
! O
me-yow O
! O
” O
as O
soft O
as O
I O
could O
, O
and O
then O
I O
put O
out O
the O
light O
and O
scrambled O
out O
of O
the O
window O
on O
to O
the B-FAC
shed I-FAC
. O
Then O
I O
slipped O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
crawled O
in O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
, O
sure O
enough O
, O
there O
was O
Tom B-PER
Sawyer I-PER
waiting O
for O
me O
. O
CHAPTER O
II O
. O
WE O
went O
tiptoeing O
along O
a O
path O
amongst O
the O
trees O
back O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
's O
garden O
, O
stooping O
down O
so O
as O
the O
branches O
would O
n't O
scrape O
our O
heads O
. O
When O
we O
was O
passing O
by O
the B-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
I O
fell O
over O
a O
root O
and O
made O
a O
noise O
. O
We O
scrouched O
down O
and O
laid O
still O
. O
Miss B-PER
Watson O
's O
big O
nigger O
, O
named O
Jim B-PER
, O
was O
setting O
in O
the O
kitchen B-FAC
door O
; O
we O
could O
see O
him O
pretty O
clear O
, O
because O
there O
was O
a O
light O
behind O
him O
. O
He O
got O
up O
and O
stretched O
his O
neck O
out O
about O
a O
minute O
, O
listening O
. O
Then O
he O
says O
: O
“ O
Who O
dah O
? O
” O
He O
listened O
some O
more O
; O
then O
he O
come O
tiptoeing O
down O
and O
stood O
right O
between O
us O
; O
we O
could O
a O
touched O
him O
, O
nearly O
. O
Well O
, O
likely O
it O
was O
minutes O
and O
minutes O
that O
there O
war O
n't O
a O
sound O
, O
and O
we O
all O
there O
so O
close O
together O
. O
There O
was O
a O
place O
on O
my O
ankle O
that O
got O
to O
itching O
, O
but O
I O
das O
n't O
scratch O
it O
; O
and O
then O
my O
ear O
begun O
to O
itch O
; O
and O
next O
my O
back O
, O
right O
between O
my O
shoulders O
. O
Seemed O
like O
I O
'd O
die O
if O
I O
could O
n't O
scratch O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
've O
noticed O
that O
thing O
plenty O
times O
since O
. O
If O
you O
are O
with O
the O
quality O
, O
or O
at O
a O
funeral O
, O
or O
trying O
to O
go O
to O
sleep O
when O
you O
ai O
n't O
sleepy O
-- O
if O
you O
are O
anywheres O
where O
it O
wo O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
to O
scratch O
, O
why O
you O
will O
itch O
all O
over O
in O
upwards O
of O
a O
thousand O
places O
. O
Pretty O
soon O
Jim B-PER
says O
: O
“ O
Say O
, O
who O
is O
you O
? O
Whar O
is O
you O
? O
Dog O
my O
cats O
ef O
I O
didn O
' O
hear O
sumf O
' O
n. O
Well O
, O
I O
know O
what O
I O
's O
gwyne O
to O
do O
: O
I O
's O
gwyne O
to O
set O
down O
here O
and O
listen O
tell O
I O
hears O
it O
agin O
. O
” O
So O
he O
set O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
betwixt O
me O
and O
Tom B-PER
. O
He O
leaned O
his O
back O
up O
against O
a O
tree O
, O
and O
stretched O
his O
legs O
out O
till O
one O
of O
them O
most O
touched O
one O
of O
mine O
. O
My O
nose O
begun O
to O
itch O
. O
It O
itched O
till O
the O
tears O
come O
into O
my O
eyes O
. O
But O
I O
das O
n't O
scratch O
. O
Then O
it O
begun O
to O
itch O
on O
the O
inside O
. O
Next O
I O
got O
to O
itching O
underneath O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
was O
going O
to O
set O
still O
. O
This O
miserableness O
went O
on O
as O
much O
as O
six O
or O
seven O
minutes O
; O
but O
it O
seemed O
a O
sight O
longer O
than O
that O
. O
I O
was O
itching O
in O
eleven O
different O
places O
now O
. O
I O
reckoned O
I O
could O
n't O
stand O
it O
more O
'n O
a O
minute O
longer O
, O
but O
I O
set O
my O
teeth O
hard O
and O
got O
ready O
to O
try O
. O
Just O
then O
Jim B-PER
begun O
to O
breathe O
heavy O
; O
next O
he O
begun O
to O
snore O
-- O
and O
then O
I O
was O
pretty O
soon O
comfortable O
again O
. O
CHAPTER O
I O
When O
I O
was O
a B-PER
small I-PER
boy I-PER
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
century O
I O
remember O
an O
old O
man O
who O
wore O
knee-breeches O
and O
worsted O
stockings O
, O
and O
who O
used O
to O
hobble O
about O
the O
street O
of O
our B-GPE
village I-GPE
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
stick O
. O
He O
must O
have O
been O
getting O
on O
for O
eighty O
in O
the O
year O
1807 O
, O
earlier O
than O
which O
date O
I O
suppose O
I O
can O
hardly O
remember O
him O
, O
for O
I O
was O
born O
in O
1802 O
. O
A O
few O
white O
locks O
hung O
about O
his O
ears O
, O
his O
shoulders O
were O
bent O
and O
his O
knees O
feeble O
, O
but O
he O
was O
still O
hale O
, O
and O
was O
much O
respected O
in O
our B-GPE
little I-GPE
world I-GPE
of I-GPE
Paleham I-GPE
. O
His O
name O
was O
Pontifex B-PER
. O
His B-PER
wife I-PER
was O
said O
to O
be O
his B-PER
master I-PER
; O
I O
have O
been O
told O
she O
brought O
him O
a O
little O
money O
, O
but O
it O
can O
not O
have O
been O
much O
. O
She O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
square-shouldered O
person O
( O
I O
have O
heard O
my B-PER
father I-PER
call O
her O
a B-PER
Gothic I-PER
woman I-PER
) O
who O
had O
insisted O
on O
being O
married O
to O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
when O
he O
was O
young O
and O
too O
good-natured O
to O
say O
nay O
to O
any B-PER
woman I-PER
who I-PER
wooed I-PER
him I-PER
. O
The B-PER
pair I-PER
had O
lived O
not O
unhappily O
together O
, O
for O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
's O
temper O
was O
easy O
and O
he O
soon O
learned O
to O
bow O
before O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
's O
more O
stormy O
moods O
. O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
was O
a B-PER
carpenter I-PER
by I-PER
trade I-PER
; O
he O
was O
also O
at O
one O
time O
parish B-PER
clerk I-PER
; O
when O
I O
remember O
him O
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
so O
far O
risen O
in O
life O
as O
to O
be O
no O
longer O
compelled O
to O
work O
with O
his O
own O
hands O
. O
In O
his O
earlier O
days O
he O
had O
taught O
himself O
to O
draw O
. O
I O
do O
not O
say O
he O
drew O
well O
, O
but O
it O
was O
surprising O
he O
should O
draw O
as O
well O
as O
he O
did O
. O
My O
father O
, O
who O
took O
the O
living O
of O
Paleham B-PER
about O
the O
year O
1797 O
, O
became O
possessed O
of O
a O
good O
many O
of O
old O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
's O
drawings O
, O
which O
were O
always O
of O
local O
subjects O
, O
and O
so O
unaffectedly O
painstaking O
that O
they O
might O
have O
passed O
for O
the O
work O
of O
some B-PER
good I-PER
early I-PER
master I-PER
. O
I O
remember O
them O
as O
hanging O
up O
framed O
and O
glazed O
in O
the O
study O
at O
the B-FAC
Rectory I-FAC
, O
and O
tinted O
, O
as O
all O
else O
in O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
was O
tinted O
, O
with O
the O
green O
reflected O
from O
the O
fringe O
of O
ivy O
leaves O
that O
grew O
around O
the O
windows O
. O
I O
wonder O
how O
they O
will O
actually O
cease O
and O
come O
to O
an O
end O
as O
drawings O
, O
and O
into O
what O
new O
phases O
of O
being O
they O
will O
then O
enter O
. O
Not O
content O
with O
being O
an B-PER
artist I-PER
, O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
must O
needs O
also O
be O
a B-PER
musician I-PER
. O
He O
built O
the O
organ O
in O
the B-FAC
church I-FAC
with O
his O
own O
hands O
, O
and O
made O
a O
smaller O
one O
which O
he O
kept O
in O
his B-FAC
own I-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
He O

play O
as O
much O
as O
he O
could O
draw O
, O
not O
very O
well O
according O
to O
professional O
standards O
, O
but O
much O
better O
than O
could O
have O
been O
expected O
. O
I O
myself O
showed O
a O
taste O
for O
music O
at O
an O
early O
age O
, O
and O
old O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
on O
finding O
it O
out O
, O
as O
he O
soon O
did O
, O
became O
partial O
to O
me O
in O
consequence O
. O
It O
may O
be O
thought O
that O
with O
so O
many O
irons O
in O
the O
fire O
he O
could O
hardly O
be O
a B-PER
very I-PER
thriving I-PER
man I-PER
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
. O
His B-PER
father I-PER
had O
been O
a B-PER
day I-PER
labourer I-PER
, O
and O
he O
had O
himself O
begun O
life O
with O
no O
other O
capital O
than O
his O
good O
sense O
and O
good O
constitution O
; O
now O
, O
however O
, O
there O
was O
a O
goodly O
show O
of O
timber O
about O
his B-FAC
yard I-FAC
, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
solid O
comfort O
over O
his B-FAC
whole I-FAC
establishment I-FAC
. O
Towards O
the O
close O
of O
the O
eighteenth O
century O
and O
not O
long O
before O
my B-PER
father I-PER
came O
to O
Paleham B-GPE
, O
he O
had O
taken O
a B-FAC
farm I-FAC
of I-FAC
about I-FAC
ninety I-FAC
acres I-FAC
, O
thus O
making O
a O
considerable O
rise O
in O
life O
. O
Along O
with O
the B-FAC
farm I-FAC
there O
went O
an B-FAC
old-fashioned I-FAC
but I-FAC
comfortable I-FAC
house I-FAC
with I-FAC
a I-FAC
charming I-FAC
garden I-FAC
and I-FAC
an I-FAC
orchard I-FAC
. O
The B-PER
carpenter I-PER
's O
business O
was O
now O
carried O
on O
in O
one O
of O
the O
outhouses O
that O
had O
once O
been O
part O
of O
some B-FAC
conventual I-FAC
buildings I-FAC
, O
the O
remains O
of O
which O
could O
be O
seen O
in O
what O
was O
called O
the B-FAC
Abbey I-FAC
Close I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
house I-FAC
itself I-FAC
, I-FAC
embosomed I-FAC
in I-FAC
honeysuckles I-FAC
and I-FAC
creeping I-FAC
roses I-FAC
, O
was O
an O
ornament O
to O
the B-GPE
whole I-GPE
village I-GPE
, O
nor O
were O
its O
internal O
arrangements O
less O
exemplary O
than O
its O
outside O
was O
ornamental O
. O
Report O
said O
that O
Mrs B-PER
Pontifex O
starched O
the O
sheets O
for O
her O
best O
bed O
, O
and O
I O
can O
well O
believe O
it O
. O
How O
well O
do O
I O
remember O
her O
parlour O
half O
filled O
with O
the O
organ O
which O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
had O
built O
, O
and O
scented O
with O
a O
withered O
apple O
or O
two O
from O
the O
_ O
pyrus O
japonica O
_ O
that O
grew O
outside O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
; O
the O
picture O
of O
the O
prize O
ox O
over O
the O
chimney-piece O
, O
which O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
himself O
had O
painted O
; O
the O

All O
has O
long O
since O
vanished O
and O
become O
a O
memory O
, O
faded O
but O
still O
fragrant O
to O
myself O
. O
Nay O
, O
but O
her B-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
-- O
and O
the O
glimpses O
into O
a B-FAC
cavernous I-FAC
cellar I-FAC
beyond I-FAC
it I-FAC

skimming I-PER

; O
or O
again O
her B-FAC
storeroom I-FAC
, I-FAC
where I-FAC
among I-FAC
other I-FAC
treasures I-FAC
she I-FAC
kept I-FAC
the I-FAC
famous I-FAC
lipsalve I-FAC
which I-FAC
was I-FAC
one I-FAC
of I-FAC
her I-FAC
especial I-FAC
glories I-FAC
, O
and O
of O
which O
she O
would O
present O
a O
shape O
yearly O
to O
those O
whom O
she O
delighted O
to O
honour O
. O
She O
wrote O
out O
the O
recipe O
for O
this O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
a O
year O
or O
two O
before O
she O
died O
, O
but O
we O
could O
never O
make O
it O
as O
she O
did O
. O
When O
we O
were O
children B-PER
she O
used O
sometimes O
to O
send O
her O
respects O
to O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
and O
ask O
leave O
for O
us O
to O
come O
and O
take O
tea O
with O
her O
. O
Right O
well O
she O
used O
to O
ply O
us O
. O
As O
for O
her O
temper O
, O
we O
never O
met O
such O
a B-PER
delightful I-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
in O
our O
lives O
; O
whatever O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
may O
have O
had O
to O
put O
up O
with O
, O
we O
had O
no O
cause O
for O
complaint O
, O
and O
then O
Mr B-PER
Pontifex O
would O
play O
to O
us O
upon O
the O
organ O
, O
and O
we O
would O
stand O
round O
him O
open-mouthed O
and O
think O
him O
the O
most O
wonderfully O
clever O
man O
that O
ever O
was O
born O
, O
except O
of O
course O
our B-PER
papa I-PER
. O
Mrs B-PER
Pontifex O
had O
no O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
at O
least O
I O
can O
call O
to O
mind O
no O
signs O
of O
this O
, O
but O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
had O
plenty O
of O
fun O
in O
him O
, O
though O
few O
would O
have O
guessed O
it O
from O
his O
appearance O
. O
I O
remember O
my B-PER
father I-PER
once O
sent O
me O
down O
to O
his B-FAC
workship I-FAC
to O
get O
some O
glue O
, O
and O
I O
happened O
to O
come O
when O
old B-PER
Pontifex I-PER
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
scolding O
his B-PER
boy I-PER
. O
He O
had O
got O
the B-PER
lad I-PER
-- O
a B-PER
pudding-headed I-PER
fellow I-PER
-- O
by O
the O
ear O
and O
was O
saying O
, O
" O
What O
? O
Lost O
again O
-- O
smothered O
o O
' O
wit O
. O
" O
( O
I O
believe O
it O
was O
the O
boy O
who O
was O
himself O
supposed O
to O
be O
a B-PER
wandering I-PER
soul I-PER
, O
and O
who O
was O
thus O
addressed O
as O
lost O
. O
) O
" O
Now O
, O
look O
here O
, O
my B-PER
lad I-PER
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
some B-PER
boys I-PER
are O
born O
stupid O
, O
and O
thou O
art O
one O
of O
them O
; O
some O
achieve O
stupidity O

that O

thee O
again O

Jim B-PER
-- O
thou O
wast O
both O
born O
stupid O
and O
hast O
greatly O
increased O
thy O
birthright O
-- O
and O
some O
" O
( O
and O
here O
came O
a O
climax O
during O
which O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
's O
head O
and O
ear O
were O
swayed O
from O
side O
to O
side O
) O
" O
have O
stupidity O
thrust O
upon O
them O
, O
which O
, O
if O
it O
please O
the B-PER
Lord I-PER
, O
shall O
not O
be O
thy O
case O
, O
my B-PER
lad I-PER
, O
for O
I O
will O
thrust O
stupidity O
from O
thee O
, O
though O
I O
have O
to O
box O
thine O
ears O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
" O
but O
I O
did O
not O
see O
that O
the B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
really O
did O
box O
Jim B-PER
's O
ears O
, O
or O
do O
more O
than O
pretend O
to O
frighten O
him O
, O
for O
the O
two O
understood O
one O
another O
perfectly O
well O
. O
Another O
time O
I O
remember O
hearing O
him O
call O
the B-PER
village I-PER
rat-catcher I-PER
by O
saying O
, O
" O
Come O
hither O
, O
thou O
three-days-and-three-nights O
, O
thou O
, O
" O
alluding O
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
learned O
, O
to O
the B-PER
rat-catcher I-PER
's O
periods O
of O
intoxication O
; O
but O
I O
will O
tell O
no O
more O
of O
such O
trifles O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
's O
face O
would O
always O
brighten O
when O
old B-PER
Pontifex I-PER
's O
name O
was O
mentioned O
. O
" O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
Edward B-PER
, O
" O
he O
would O
say O
to O
me O
, O
" O
old B-PER
Pontifex I-PER
was O
not O
only O
an B-PER
able I-PER
man I-PER
, O
but O
he O
was O
one B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
very I-PER
ablest I-PER
men I-PER
that I-PER
ever I-PER
I I-PER
knew I-PER
. O
" O
This O
was O
more O
than O
I O
as O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
was O
prepared O
to O
stand O
. O
" O
My B-PER
dear I-PER
father I-PER
, O
" O
I O
answered O
, O
" O
what O
did O
he O
do O
? O
He O
could O
draw O
a O
little O
, O
but O
could O
he O
to O
save O
his O
life O
have O
got O
a O
picture O
into O
the B-ORG
Royal I-ORG
Academy I-ORG
exhibition O
? O
He O
built O
two O
organs O
and O
could O
play O
the O
Minuet O
in O
_ O
Samson O
_ O
on O
one O
and O
the O
March O
in O
_ O
Scipio O
_ O
on O
the O
other O
; O
he O
was O
a B-PER
good I-PER
carpenter I-PER
and O
a O
bit O
of O
a B-PER
wag I-PER
; O
he O
was O
a B-PER
good I-PER
old I-PER
fellow I-PER
enough I-PER
, O
but O
why O
make O
him O
out O
so O
much O
abler O
than O
he O
was O
? O
" O
" O
My B-PER
boy I-PER
, O
" O
returned O
my B-PER
father I-PER
, O
" O
you O
must O
not O
judge O
by O
the O
work O
, O
but O
by O
the O
work O
in O
connection O

the O
surroundings O
. O
Could O
Giotto B-PER

Filippo B-PER
Lippi I-PER
, O
think O
you O
, O
have O
got O
a O
picture O
into O
the B-FAC

Would O
a O

one O
of O
those O

went O
to O

we O
were O
at O
Padua B-GPE

the O
remotest O
chance O
of O
being O
hung O
, O
if O
it O
were O
sent O
in O
for O
exhibition O
now O
? O
Why O
, O
the B-ORG
Academy I-ORG
people O
would O
be O
so O
outraged O
that O
they O
would O
not O
even O
write O
to O
poor B-PER
Giotto I-PER
to O
tell O
him O
to O
come O

take O
his O
fresco O
away O

Phew O

continued O
he O
, O
waxing O
warm O
, O
" O
if O
old B-PER
Pontifex I-PER
had O
had O
Cromwell B-PER

chances O

would O

all O

in O
the B-LOC

, O
on O
the B-FAC
site I-FAC
of I-FAC
Hell I-FAC
Row I-FAC
, O
they O
erected O
the B-FAC
Bottoms I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
Bottoms I-FAC
consisted O
of O
six O
blocks O
of O
miners B-PER
' O
dwellings O
, O
two B-FAC
rows I-FAC
of I-FAC
three I-FAC
, O
like O
the O
dots O
on O
a O
blank-six O
domino O
, O
and O
twelve B-FAC
houses I-FAC
in O
a O
block O
. O
This O
double O
row O
of O
dwellings O
sat O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
rather O
sharp O
slope O
from O
Bestwood O
, O
and O
looked O
out O
, O
from O
the O
attic O
windows O
at O
least O
, O
on O
the O
slow O
climb O
of O
the O
valley O
towards O
Selby O
. O
The B-FAC
houses I-FAC
themselves O
were O
substantial O
and O
very O
decent O
. O
One O
could O
walk O
all O
round O
, O
seeing O
little B-FAC
front I-FAC
gardens I-FAC
with I-FAC
auriculas I-FAC
and I-FAC
saxifrage I-FAC
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
bottom O
block O
, O
sweet-williams O
and O
pinks O
in O
the B-FAC
sunny I-FAC
top I-FAC
block I-FAC
; O
seeing O
neat O
front O
windows O
, O
little O
porches O
, O
little O
privet O
hedges O
, O
and O
dormer O
windows O
for O
the O
attics O
. O
But O
that O
was O
outside O
; O
that O
was O
the O
view O
on O
to O
the O
uninhabited O
parlours O
of O
all O
the B-PER
colliers I-PER
' O
wives O
. O
The O
dwelling-room O
, O
the O
kitchen O
, O
was O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
house O
, O
facing O
inward O
between O
the O
blocks O
, O
looking O
at O
a B-FAC
scrubby I-FAC
back I-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
and O
then O
at O
the O
ash-pits O
. O
And O
between O
the O
rows O
, O
between O
the O
long O
lines O
of O
ash-pits O
, O
went O
the O
alley O
, O
where O
the B-PER
children I-PER
played O
and O
the B-PER
women I-PER
gossiped O
and O
the B-PER
men I-PER
smoked O
. O
So O
, O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
living O
in O
the B-FAC
Bottoms I-FAC
, O
that O
was O
so O
well O
built O
and O
that O
looked O
so O
nice O
, O
were O
quite O
unsavoury O
because O
people B-PER
must O
live O
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
the O
kitchens O
opened O
on O
to O
that O
nasty O
alley O
of O
ash-pits O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Morel O
was O
not O
anxious O
to O
move O
into O
the B-FAC
Bottoms I-FAC
, I-FAC
which I-FAC
was I-FAC
already I-FAC
twelve I-FAC
years I-FAC
old I-FAC
and O
on O
the O
downward O
path O
, O
when O
she O
descended O
to O
it O
from O
Bestwood B-GPE
. O
But O
it O
was O
the O
best O
she O
could O
do O
. O
Moreover O
, O
she O
had O
an O
end O
house O
in O
one O
of O
the B-FAC
top I-FAC
blocks I-FAC
, O
and O
thus O
had O
only B-PER
one I-PER
neighbour I-PER
; O
on O
the O
other O
side O
an O
extra O
strip O
of O
garden B-FAC
. O
And O
, O
having O
an B-FAC
end I-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
she O
enjoyed O
a O
kind O
of O
aristocracy O
among O
the O
other O
women O
of O
the B-FAC
“ I-FAC
between I-FAC
” I-FAC
houses I-FAC
, O
because O
her O
rent O
was O
five O
shillings O
and O
sixpence O
instead O
of O
five O
shillings O
a O
week O
. O
But O
this O
superiority O
in O
station O
was O
not O
much O
consolation O
to O
Mrs. B-PER
Morel O
. O
She O
was O
thirty-one O
years O
old O
, O
and O
had O
been O
married O
eight O
years O
. O
A B-PER
rather I-PER
small I-PER
woman I-PER
, I-PER
of I-PER
delicate I-PER
mould I-PER
but I-PER
resolute I-PER
bearing I-PER
, O
she O
shrank O
a O
little O
from O
the O
first O
contact O
with O
the B-FAC
Bottoms I-FAC
women O
. O
She O
came O
down O
in O
the O
July O
, O
and O
in O
the O
September O
expected O
her B-PER
third I-PER
baby I-PER
. O
Her B-PER
husband I-PER
was O
a B-PER
miner I-PER
. O
They O
had O
only O
been O
in O
their B-FAC
new I-FAC
home I-FAC
three O
weeks O
when O
the O
wakes O
, O
or O
fair O
, O
began O
. O
Morel B-PER
, O
she O
knew O
, O
was O
sure O
to O
make O
a O
holiday O
of O
it O
. O
He O
went O
off O
early O
on O
the O
Monday O
morning O
, O
the O
day O
of O
the O
fair O
. O
The B-PER
two I-PER
children I-PER
were O
highly O
excited O
. O
William B-PER
, O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
of I-PER
seven I-PER
, O
fled O
off O
immediately O
after O
breakfast O
, O
to O
prowl O
round O
the B-FAC
wakes I-FAC
ground I-FAC
, O
leaving O
Annie B-PER
, O
who O
was O
only O
five O
, O
to O
whine O
all O
morning O
to O
go O
also O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Morel O
did O
her O
work O
. O
She O
scarcely O
knew O
her B-PER
neighbours I-PER
yet O
, O
and O
knew O
no O
one O
with O
whom O
to O
trust O
the B-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
. O
So O
she O
promised O
to O
take O
her O
to O
the O
wakes O
after O
dinner O
. O
William B-PER
appeared O
at O
half-past O
twelve O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
very I-PER
active I-PER
lad I-PER
, I-PER
fair-haired I-PER
, I-PER
freckled I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
touch I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
Dane I-PER
or I-PER
Norwegian I-PER
about I-PER
him I-PER
. O
“ O
Can O
I O
have O
my O
dinner O
, O
mother B-PER
? O
” O
he O
cried O
, O
rushing O
in O
with O
his O
cap O
on O
. O
“ O
'Cause O
it O
begins O
at O
half-past O
one O
, O
the B-PER
man I-PER
says O
so O
. O
” O
“ O
You O
can O
have O
your O
dinner O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
's O
done O
, O
” O
replied O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
“ O
Is O
n't O
it O
done O
? O
” O
he O
cried O
, O
his B-PER
blue I-PER
eyes I-PER
staring O
at O
her O
in O
indignation O
. O
“ O
Then O
I O
'm O
goin O
' O
be-out O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
You O
'll O
do O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
. O
It O
will O
be O
done O
in O
five O
minutes O
. O
It O
is O
only O
half-past O
twelve O
. O
” O
“ O
They O
'll O
be O
beginnin O
' O
, O
” O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
half O
cried O
, O
half O
shouted O
. O
“ O
You O
wo O
n't O
die O
if O
they O
do O
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
“ O
Besides O
, O
it O
's O
only O
half-past O
twelve O
, O
so O
you O
've O
a O
full O
hour O
. O
” O
The B-PER
lad I-PER
began O
hastily O
to O
lay O
the O
table O
, O
and O
directly O
the B-PER
three I-PER
sat O
down O
. O
They O
were O
eating O
batter-pudding O
and O
jam O
, O
when O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
jumped O
off O
his O
chair O
and O
stood O
perfectly O
stiff O
. O
Some O
distance O
away O
could O
be O
heard O
the O
first O
small O
braying O
of O
a O
merry-go-round O
, O
and O
the O
tooting O
of O
a O
horn O
. O
His O
face O
quivered O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
“ O
I O
told O
you O
! O
” O
he O
said O
, O
running O
to O
the O
dresser O
for O
his O
cap O
. O
“ O
Take O
your O
pudding O
in O
your O
hand O
-- O
and O
it O
's O
only O
five O
past O
one O
, O
so O
you O
were O
wrong O
-- O
you O
have O
n't O
got O
your O
twopence O
, O
” O
cried O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
in O
a O
breath O
. O
The B-PER
boy I-PER
came O
back O
, O
bitterly O
disappointed O
, O
for O
his O
twopence O
, O
then O
went O
off O
without O
a O
word O
. O
“ O
I O
want O
to O
go O
, O
I O
want O
to O
go O
, O
” O
said O
Annie B-PER
, O
beginning O
to O
cry O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
and O
you O
shall O
go O
, O
whining B-PER
, I-PER
wizzening I-PER
little I-PER
stick I-PER
! O
” O
said O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
And O
later O
in O
the O
afternoon O
she O
trudged O
up O
the B-LOC
hill I-LOC
under O
the O
tall O
hedge O
with O
her B-PER
child I-PER
. O
The O
hay O
was O
gathered O
from O
the B-LOC
fields I-LOC
, O
and O
cattle O
were O
turned O
on O
to O
the O
eddish O
. O
It O
was O
warm O
, O
peaceful O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Morel O
did O
not O
like O
the B-LOC
wakes I-LOC
. O
There O
were O
two O
sets O
of O
horses O
, O
one O
going O
by O
steam O
, O
one O
pulled O
round O
by O
a O
pony O
; O
three O
organs O
were O
grinding O
, O
and O
there O
came O
odd O
cracks O
of O
pistol-shots O
, O
fearful O
screeching O
of O
the B-PER
cocoanut I-PER
man I-PER
's O
rattle O
, O
shouts O
of O
the B-PER
Aunt I-PER
Sally I-PER
man I-PER
, O
screeches O
from O
the B-PER
peep-show I-PER
lady I-PER
. O
The B-PER
mother I-PER
perceived O
her O
son B-PER
gazing O
enraptured O
outside O
the B-FAC
Lion I-FAC
Wallace I-FAC
booth I-FAC
, O
at O
the O
pictures O
of O
this O
famous O
lion O
that O
had O
killed O
a B-PER
negro I-PER
and O
maimed O
for O
life O
two B-PER
white I-PER
men I-PER
. O
She O
left O
him O
alone O
, O
and O
went O
to O
get O
Annie B-PER
a O
spin O
of O
toffee O
. O
Presently O
the B-PER
lad I-PER
stood O
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
wildly O
excited O
. O
“ O
You O
never O
said O

” O
He O
pulled O
from O
his O
pocket O
two O
egg-cups O
, O
with O
pink O
moss-roses O
on O
them O
. O
“ O
I O

She O
knew O
he O
wanted O
them O
for O
her O
. O
“ O
H O

” O
she O
said O
, O
pleased O

“ O
They O

“ O

” O
He O
was O
tipful O
of O
excitement O
now O
she O
had O
come O
, O
led O
her O
about O
the O
ground O
, O
showed O
her O
everything O
. O
Then O
, O
at O
the O
peep-show O
, O
she O
explained O
the O
pictures O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
story O
, O
to O
which O
he O
listened O
as O
if O
spellbound O
. O
He O
would O
not O
leave O
her O
. O
All O
the O
time O
he O
stuck O
close O
to O
her O
, O
bristling O
with O
a B-PER
small I-PER
boy I-PER
's O
pride O
of O
her O
. O
For O
no B-PER
other I-PER
woman I-PER
looked O
such B-PER
a I-PER
lady I-PER
as O
she O
did O
, O
in O
her O
little O
black O
bonnet O
and O
her O
cloak O
. O
She O
smiled O
when O
she O
saw O
women B-PER
she I-PER
knew I-PER
. O
When O
she O
was O
tired O
she O
said O
to O
her B-PER
son I-PER
: O
“ O
Well O
, O
are O
you O
coming O
now O
, O
or O
later O
? O
” O
“ O
Are O
you O
goin O
' O
a O
' O
ready O
? O
” O
he O
cried O
, O
his O
face O
full O
of O
reproach O
. O
“ O
Already O
? O
It O
is O
past O
four O
, O
I O
know O
. O
” O
“ O
What O
are O
you O
goin O
' O
a O

” O
he O
lamented O
. O
“ O
You O
need O
n't O
come O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
And O
she O
went O
slowly O
away O
with O
her B-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
whilst O
her B-PER
son I-PER
stood O
watching O
her O
, O
cut O
to O
the O
heart O
to O
let O
her O
go O
, O
and O
yet O
unable O
to O
leave O
the B-LOC
wakes I-LOC
. O
As O
she O
crossed O
the B-FAC
open I-FAC
ground I-FAC
in I-FAC
front I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
Moon I-FAC
and I-FAC
Stars I-FAC
she O
heard O
men B-PER
shouting O
, O
and O
smelled O
the O
beer O
, O
and O
hurried O
a O
little O
, O
thinking O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
was O
probably O
in O
the O
bar O
. O
At O
about O
half-past O
six O
her B-PER
son I-PER
came O
home O
, O
tired O
now O
, O
rather O
pale O
, O
and O
somewhat O
wretched O
. O
He O
was O
miserable O
, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
know O
it O
, O
because O
he O
had O
let O
her O
go O
alone O
. O
Since O
she O
had O
gone O
, O
he O
had O
not O
enjoyed O
his O
wakes O
. O
“ O
Has O
my B-PER
dad I-PER
been O
? O
” O
he O
asked O

“ O
No O

said O
the B-PER
mother I-PER

Chapter O
I O
Out O
to O
Sea B-LOC
I O
had O
this O
story O
from O
one O
who O
had O
no O
business O
to O
tell O
it O
to O
me O
, O
or O
to O
any B-PER
other I-PER
. O
I O
may O
credit O
the O
seductive O
influence O
of O
an O
old O
vintage O
upon O
the B-PER
narrator I-PER
for O
the O
beginning O
of O
it O
, O
and O
my O
own O
skeptical O
incredulity O
during O
the O
days O
that O
followed O
for O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
strange O
tale O
. O
When O
my B-PER
convivial I-PER
host I-PER
discovered O
that O
he O
had O
told O
me O
so O
much O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
prone O
to O
doubtfulness O
, O
his O
foolish O
pride O
assumed O
the O
task O
the O
old O
vintage O
had O
commenced O
, O
and O
so O
he O
unearthed O
written O
evidence O
in O
the O
form O
of O
musty O
manuscript O
, O
and O
dry O
official O
records O
of O
the B-ORG
British I-ORG
Colonial I-ORG
Office I-ORG
to O
support O
many O
of O
the O
salient O
features O
of O
his O
remarkable O
narrative O
. O
I O
do O
not O
say O
the O
story O
is O
true O
, O
for O
I O
did O
not O
witness O
the O
happenings O
which O
it O
portrays O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
the O
telling O
of O
it O
to O
you O
I O
have O
taken O
fictitious O
names O
for O
the B-PER
principal I-PER
characters I-PER
quite O
sufficiently O
evidences O
the O
sincerity O
of O
my O
own O
belief O
that O
it O
MAY O
be O
true O
. O
The O
yellow O
, O
mildewed O
pages O
of O
the O
diary O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
long I-PER
dead I-PER
, O
and O
the O
records O
of O
the B-ORG
Colonial I-ORG
Office I-ORG
dovetail O
perfectly O
with O
the O
narrative O
of O
my B-PER
convivial I-PER
host I-PER
, O
and O
so O
I O
give O
you O
the O
story O
as O
I O
painstakingly O
pieced O
it O
out O
from O
these O
several O
various O
agencies O
. O
If O
you O
do O
not O
find O
it O
credible O
you O
will O
at O
least O
be O
as O
one O
with O
me O
in O
acknowledging O
that O
it O
is O
unique O
, O
remarkable O
, O
and O
interesting O
. O
From O
the O
records O
of O
the B-ORG
Colonial I-ORG
Office I-ORG
and O
from O
the B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
's O
diary O
we O
learn O
that O
a B-PER
certain I-PER
young I-PER
English I-PER
nobleman I-PER
, O
whom O
we O
shall O
call O
John B-PER
Clayton I-PER
, O
Lord B-PER
Greystoke O
, O
was O
commissioned O
to O
make O
a O
peculiarly O
delicate O
investigation O
of O
conditions O
in O
a B-GPE
British I-GPE
West I-GPE
Coast I-GPE
African I-GPE
Colony I-GPE
from O
whose O
simple B-PER
native I-PER
inhabitants I-PER
another O
European B-GPE
power I-GPE
was O
known O
to O
be O
recruiting O
soldiers B-PER
for O
its B-ORG
native I-ORG
army I-ORG
, O
which O
it O
used O
solely O
for O
the O
forcible O
collection O
of O
rubber O
and O
ivory O
from O
the O
savage O
tribes O
along O
the B-LOC
Congo I-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
Aruwimi I-LOC
. O
The O
natives O
of O
the B-GPE
British I-GPE
Colony I-GPE
complained O
that O
many O
of O
their B-PER
young I-PER
men I-PER
were O
enticed O
away O
through O
the O
medium O
of O
fair O
and O
glowing O
promises O
, O
but O
that O
few O
if O
any O
ever O
returned O
to O
their B-PER
families I-PER
. O
The O
Englishmen O
in O
Africa B-GPE
went O
even O
further O
, O
saying O
that O
these B-PER
poor I-PER
blacks I-PER
were O
held O
in O
virtual O
slavery O
, O
since O
after O
their O
terms O
of O
enlistment O
expired O
their O
ignorance O
was O
imposed O
upon O
by O
their B-PER
white I-PER
officers I-PER
, O
and O
they O
were O
told O
that O
they O
had O
yet O
several O
years O
to O
serve O
. O
And O
so O
the B-ORG
Colonial I-ORG
Office I-ORG
appointed O
John B-PER
Clayton I-PER
to O
a O
new O
post O
in O
British B-GPE
West I-GPE
Africa I-GPE
, O
but O
his O
confidential O
instructions O
centered O
on O
a O
thorough O
investigation O
of O
the O
unfair O
treatment O
of O
black B-PER
British I-PER
subjects I-PER
by O
the O
officers O
of O
a B-GPE
friendly I-GPE
European I-GPE
power I-GPE
. O
Why O
he O
was O
sent O
, O
is O
, O
however O
, O
of O
little O
moment O
to O
this O
story O
, O
for O
he O
never O
made O
an O
investigation O
, O
nor O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
did O
he O
ever O
reach O
his B-FAC
destination I-FAC
. O
Clayton B-PER
was O
the O
type O
of O
Englishman B-PER
that O
one O
likes O
best O
to O
associate O
with O
the O
noblest O
monuments O
of O
historic O
achievement O
upon O
a B-FAC
thousand I-FAC
victorious I-FAC
battlefields I-FAC
-- O
a B-PER
strong I-PER
, I-PER
virile I-PER
man I-PER
-- O
mentally O
, O
morally O
, O
and O
physically O
. O
In O
stature O
he O
was O
above O
the O
average O
height O
; O
his O
eyes O
were O
gray O
, O
his O
features O
regular O
and O
strong O
; O
his O
carriage O
that O
of O
perfect O
, O
robust O
health O
influenced O
by O
his O
years O
of O
army O
training O
. O
Political O
ambition O
had O
caused O
him O
to O
seek O
transference O
from O
the B-ORG
army I-ORG
to O
the B-ORG
Colonial I-ORG
Office I-ORG
and O
so O
we O
find O
him O
, O
still O
young O
, O
entrusted O
with O
a O
delicate O
and O
important O
commission O
in O
the O
service O
of O
the B-PER
Queen I-PER
. O
When O
he O
received O
this O
appointment O
he O
was O
both O
elated O
and O
appalled O
. O
The O
preferment O
seemed O
to O
him O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
well-merited O
reward O
for O
painstaking O
and O
intelligent O
service O
, O
and O
as O
a O
stepping O
stone O
to O
posts O
of O
greater O
importance O
and O
responsibility O
; O
but O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
had O
been O
married O
to O
the B-PER
Hon. I-PER
Alice I-PER
Rutherford I-PER
for O
scarce O
a O
three O
months O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
thought O
of O
taking O
this B-PER
fair I-PER
young I-PER
girl I-PER
into O
the O
dangers O
and O
isolation O
of O
tropical B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
that O
appalled O
him O
. O
For O
her O
sake O
he O
would O
have O
refused O
the O
appointment O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
have O
it O
so O
. O
Instead O
she O
insisted O
that O
he O
accept O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
take O
her O
with O
him O
. O
There O
were O
mothers B-PER
and O
brothers B-PER
and O
sisters B-PER
, O
and O
aunts B-PER
and O
cousins B-PER
to O
express O
various O
opinions O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
but O
as O
to O
what O
they O
severally O
advised O
history O
is O
silent O
. O
We O
know O
only O
that O
on O
a O
bright O
May O
morning O
in O
1888 O
, O
John B-PER
, O
Lord B-PER
Greystoke O
, O
and O
Lady B-PER
Alice O
sailed O
from O
Dover B-GPE
on O
their O
way O
to O
Africa B-GPE
. O
A O
month O
later O
they O
arrived O
at O
Freetown B-GPE
where O
they O
chartered O
a B-VEH
small I-VEH
sailing I-VEH
vessel I-VEH
, O
the O
Fuwalda B-VEH
, O
which O
was O
to O
bear O
them O
to O
their B-GPE
final I-GPE
destination I-GPE
. O
And O
here O
John B-PER
, O
Lord B-PER
Greystoke O
, O
and O
Lady B-PER
Alice O
, O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
vanished O
from O
the O
eyes O
and O
from O
the O
knowledge O
of O
men B-PER
. O
Two O
months O
after O
they O
weighed O
anchor O
and O
cleared O
from O
the O
port O
of O
Freetown B-GPE
a B-VEH
half I-VEH
dozen I-VEH
British I-VEH
war I-VEH
vessels I-VEH
were O
scouring O
the B-LOC
south I-LOC
Atlantic I-LOC
for O
trace O
of O
them O
or O
their B-VEH
little I-VEH
vessel I-VEH
, O
and O
it O
was O
almost O
immediately O
that O
the O
wreckage O
was O
found O
upon O
the O
shores O
of O
St. B-PER
Helena O
which O
convinced O
the B-PER
world I-PER
that O
the B-VEH
Fuwalda I-VEH
had O
gone O
down O
with O
all B-PER
on I-PER
board I-PER
, O
and O
hence O
the O
search O
was O
stopped O
ere O
it O
had O
scarce O
begun O
; O
though O
hope O
lingered O
in O
longing O
hearts O
for O
many O
years O
. O
The B-VEH
Fuwalda I-VEH
, O
a B-VEH
barkentine I-VEH
of I-VEH
about I-VEH
one I-VEH
hundred I-VEH
tons I-VEH
, O
was O
a O
vessel O
of O
the O
type O
often O
seen O
in O
coastwise O
trade O
in O
the B-LOC
far I-LOC
southern I-LOC
Atlantic I-LOC
, O
their B-PER
crews I-PER
composed O
of O
the O
offscourings O
of O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
-- O
unhanged O
murderers O
and O
cutthroats O
of O
every O
race O
and O
every B-GPE
nation I-GPE
. O
The B-VEH
Fuwalda I-VEH
was O
no O
exception O
to O
the O
rule O
. O
Her B-PER
officers I-PER
were O
swarthy B-PER
bullies I-PER
, I-PER
hating I-PER
and I-PER
hated I-PER
by I-PER
their I-PER
crew I-PER
. O
The B-PER
captain I-PER
, O
while O
a B-PER
competent I-PER
seaman I-PER
, O
was O
a O
brute O
in O
his O
treatment O
of O
his B-PER
men I-PER
. O
He O
knew O
, O
or O
at O
least O
he O
used O
, O
but O
two O
arguments O
in O
his O
dealings O
with O
them O
-- O
a O
belaying O
pin O
and O
a O
revolver O
-- O
nor O
is O
it O
likely O
that O
the B-PER
motley I-PER
aggregation I-PER
he O
signed O
would O
have O
understood O
aught O
else O
. O
So O
it O
was O
that O
from O
the O
second O
day O
out O
from O
Freetown B-GPE
John B-PER
Clayton I-PER
and O
his B-PER
young I-PER
wife I-PER
witnessed O
scenes O
upon O
the O
deck O
of O
the B-VEH
Fuwalda I-VEH
such O
as O
they O
had O
believed O
were O
never O
enacted O
outside O
the O
covers O
of O
printed O
stories O
of O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
second O
day O
that O
the O
first O
link O
was O
forged O
in O
what O
was O
destined O
to O
form O
a O
chain O
of O
circumstances O
ending O
in O
a O
life O
for O
one O
then O
unborn O
such O
as O
has O
never O
been O
paralleled O
in O
the O
history O
of O
man B-PER
. O
Two B-PER
sailors I-PER
were O
washing O
down O
the O
decks O
of O
the B-VEH
Fuwalda I-VEH
, O
the B-PER
first I-PER
mate I-PER
was O
on O
duty O
, O
and O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
had O
stopped O
to O
speak O
with O
John B-PER
Clayton I-PER
and O
Lady B-PER
Alice O
. O
The B-PER
men I-PER
were O
working O
backwards O
toward O
the O
little O
party O
who O
were O
facing O
away O
from O
the B-PER
sailors I-PER
. O
Closer O
and O
closer O
they O
came O
, O
until O
one O
of O
them O
was O
directly O
behind O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
. O
In O
another O
moment O
he O
would O
have O
passed O
by O
and O
this O
strange O
narrative O
would O
never O
have O
been O
recorded O
. O
But O
just O
that O
instant O
the B-PER
officer I-PER
turned O
to O
leave O
Lord B-PER
and O
Lady B-PER
Greystoke O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O
tripped O
against O
the B-PER
sailor I-PER
and O
sprawled O
headlong O
upon O
the B-FAC
deck I-FAC
, O
overturning O
the O
water-pail O
so O
that O
he O
was O
drenched O
in O
its O
dirty O
contents O
. O
For O
an O
instant O
the O
scene O
was O
ludicrous O
; O
but O
only O
for O
an O
instant O
. O
With O
a O
volley O
of O
awful O
oaths O
, O
his O
face O
suffused O
with O
the O
scarlet O
of O
mortification O
and O
rage O
, O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
regained O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
with O
a O
terrific O
blow O
felled O
the B-PER
sailor I-PER
to O
the B-FAC
deck I-FAC
. O
The B-PER
man I-PER
was O
small O
and O
rather O
old O
, O
so O
that O
the O
brutality O
of O
the O
act O
was O
thus O
accentuated O
. O
The B-PER
other I-PER
seaman I-PER
, O
however O
, O
was O
neither O
old O
nor O
small O
-- O
a O
huge O
bear O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
, O
with O
fierce O
black O
mustachios O
, O
and O
a O
great O
bull O
neck O
set O
between O
massive O
shoulders O
. O
As O
he O
saw O
his B-PER
mate I-PER
go O
down O
he O
crouched O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
low O
snarl O
, O
sprang O
upon O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
crushing O
him O
to O
his O
knees O
with O
a O
single O
mighty O
blow O
. O
From O
scarlet O
the B-PER
officer I-PER
's O
face O
went O
white O
, O
for O
this O
was O
mutiny O
; O
and O
mutiny O
he O
had O
met O
and O
subdued O
before O
in O
his O
brutal O
career O
. O
Without O
waiting O
to O
rise O
he O
whipped O
a O
revolver O
from O
his O
pocket O
, O
firing O
point O
blank O
at O
the B-PER
great I-PER
mountain I-PER
of I-PER
muscle I-PER
towering I-PER
before I-PER
him I-PER
; O
but O
, O
quick O
as O
he O
was O
, O
John B-PER
Clayton I-PER
was O
almost O
as O
quick O
, O
so O
that O
the O
bullet O
which O
was O
intended O
for O
the B-PER
sailor I-PER
's O
heart O
lodged O
in O
the B-PER
sailor I-PER
's O
leg O
instead O
, O
for O
Lord B-PER
Greystoke O
had O
struck O
down O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
's O
arm O
as O
he O
had O
seen O
the O
weapon O
flash O
in O
the O
sun O
. O
Words O
passed O
between O
Clayton B-PER
and O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
, O
the B-PER
former I-PER
making O
it O
plain O
that O
he O
was O
disgusted O
with O
the O
brutality O
displayed O
toward O
the B-PER
crew I-PER
, O
nor O
would O
he O
countenance O
anything O
further O
of O
the O
kind O
while O
he O
and O
Lady B-PER
Greystoke O
remained O
passengers B-PER
. O
The B-PER
captain I-PER
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
making O
an O
angry O
reply O
, O
but O
, O
thinking O
better O
of O
it O
, O
turned O
on O
his O
heel O
and O
black O
and O
scowling O
, O
strode O
aft O
. O
He O
did O
not O
care O
to O
antagonize O
an B-PER
English I-PER
official I-PER
, O
for O
the B-PER
Queen I-PER
's O
mighty O
arm O
wielded O
a O
punitive O
instrument O
which O
he O
could O
appreciate O
, O
and O
which O
he O
feared O
-- O
England B-GPE
's O
far-reaching O
navy O
. O
The B-PER
two I-PER
sailors I-PER
picked O
themselves O
up O
, O
the O
older O
man O
assisting O
his B-PER
wounded I-PER
comrade I-PER
to O
rise O
. O
The O
big O
fellow O
, O
who O
was O
known O
among O
his B-PER
mates I-PER
as O
Black B-PER
Michael I-PER
, O
tried O
his O
leg O
gingerly O
, O
and O
, O
finding O
that O
it O
bore O
his O
weight O
, O
turned O
to O
Clayton B-PER
with O
a O
word O
of O
gruff O
thanks O
. O
Though O
the B-PER
fellow I-PER
's O
tone O
was O
surly O
, O
his O
words O
were O
evidently O
well O
meant O
. O
Ere O
he O
had O
scarce O
finished O
his O
little O
speech O
he O
had O
turned O
and O
was O
limping O
off O
toward O
the O
forecastle O
with O
the O
very O
apparent O
intention O
of O
forestalling O
any O
further O
conversation O
. O
They O
did O
not O
see O
him O
again O
for O
several O
days O
, O
nor O
did O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
accord O
them O
more O
than O
the O
surliest O
of O
grunts O
when O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
speak O
to O
them O
. O
They O
took O
their O
meals O
in O
his B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
, O
as O
they O
had O
before O
the O
unfortunate O
occurrence O
; O
but O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
was O
careful O
to O
see O
that O
his O
duties O
never O
permitted O
him O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
The B-PER
other I-PER
officers I-PER
were O
coarse B-PER
, I-PER
illiterate I-PER
fellows I-PER
, O
but O
little O
above O
the B-PER
villainous I-PER
crew I-PER
they I-PER
bullied I-PER
, O
and O
were O
only O
too O
glad O
to O
avoid O
social O
intercourse O
with O
the B-PER
polished I-PER
English I-PER
noble I-PER
and O
his B-PER
lady I-PER
, O
so O
that O
the B-PER
Claytons I-PER
were O
left O
very O
much O
to O
themselves O
. O
This O
in O
itself O
accorded O
perfectly O
with O
their O
desires O
, O
but O
it O
also O
rather O
isolated O
them O
from O
the O
life O
of O
the B-VEH
little I-VEH
ship I-VEH
so O
that O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
keep O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
daily O
happenings O
which O
were O
to O
culminate O
so O
soon O
in O
bloody O
tragedy O
. O
There O
was O
in O
the O
whole O
atmosphere O
of O
the B-VEH
craft I-VEH
that O
undefinable O
something O
which O
presages O
disaster O
. O
Outwardly O
, O
to O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the B-PER
Claytons I-PER
, O
all O

the B-VEH
little I-VEH

but O
that O
there O
was O
an O

them O

On O
the O
second O
day O
after O
the O
wounding O
of O
Black B-PER
Michael I-PER

Clayton B-PER
came O
on O

just O
in O
time O
to O
see O
the O
limp O
body O
of O
one O
of O
the B-PER
crew I-PER
being O
carried O
below O

four O
of O
his B-PER

the B-PER

a B-PER
heavy I-PER
belaying I-PER
pin I-PER
in I-PER
his I-PER

stood O
glowering O
at O
the O

CHAPTER O

IN O
WHICH O
I O
THROW O
AMBS-ACE O
THE O
work O
of O
the O
day O
being O
over O
, O
I O
sat O
down O
upon O
my O
doorstep O
, O
pipe O
in O
hand O
, O
to O
rest O
awhile O
in O
the O
cool O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
Death O
is O
not O
more O
still O
than O
is O
this B-LOC
Virginian I-LOC
land I-LOC
in O
the O
hour O
when O
the O
sun O
has O
sunk O
away O
, O
and O
it O
is O
black O
beneath O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
the O
stars O
brighten O
slowly O
and O
softly O
, O
one O
by O
one O
. O
The O
birds O
that O
sing O
all O
day O
have O
hushed O
, O
and O
the O
horned O
owls O
, O
the O
monster O
frogs O
, O
and O
that O
strange O
and O
ominous O
fowl O
( O
if O
fowl O
it O
be O
, O
and O
not O
, O
as O
some O
assert O
, O
a O
spirit O
damned O
) O
which O
we O
English B-PER
call O
the O
whippoorwill O
, O
are O
yet O
silent O
. O
Later O
the O
wolf O
will O
howl O
and O
the O
panther O
scream O
, O
but O
now O
there O
is O
no O
sound O
. O
The O
winds O
are O
laid O
, O
and O
the O
restless O
leaves O
droop O
and O
are O
quiet O
. O
The O
low O
lap O
of O
the O
water O
among O
the O
reeds O
is O
like O
the O
breathing O
of O
one O
who O
sleeps O
in O
his O
watch O
beside O
the O
dead O
. O
I O
marked O
the O
light O
die O
from O
the O
broad O
bosom O
of O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
leaving O
it O
a B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
's O
hue O
. O
Awhile O
ago O
, O
and O
for O
many O
evenings O
, O
it O
had O
been O
crimson O
, O
-- O
a B-LOC
river I-LOC
of I-LOC
blood I-LOC
. O
A O
week O
before O
, O
a O
great O
meteor O
had O
shot O
through O
the O
night O
, O
blood-red O
and O
bearded O
, O
drawing O
a O
slow-fading O
fiery O
trail O
across O
the O
heavens O
; O
and O
the O
moon O
had O
risen O
that O
same O
night O
blood-red O
, O
and O
upon O
its O
disk O
there O
was O
drawn O
in O
shadow O
a O
thing O
most O
marvelously O
like O
a O
scalping O
knife O
. O
Wherefore O
, O
the O
following O
day O
being O
Sunday O
, O
good B-PER
Mr. I-PER
Stockham I-PER
, O
our O
minister O
at O
Weyanoke B-GPE
, O
exhorted O
us O
to O
be O
on O
our O
guard O
, O
and O
in O
his O
prayer O
besought O
that O
no O
sedition O
or O
rebellion O
might O
raise O
its O
head O
amongst O
the O
Indian O
subjects O
of O
the B-PER
Lord I-PER
's O
anointed O
. O
Afterward O
, O
in O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
, O
between O
the O
services O
, O
the B-PER
more I-PER
timorous I-PER
began O
to O
tell O
of O
divers O
portents O
which O
they O
had O
observed O
, O
and O
to O
recount O
old O
tales O
of O
how O
the B-PER
savages I-PER
distressed O
us O
in O
the O
Starving O
Time O
. O
The B-PER
bolder I-PER
spirits I-PER
laughed O
them O
to O
scorn O
, O
but O
the B-PER
women I-PER
began O
to O
weep O
and O
cower O
, O
and O
I O
, O
though O
I O
laughed O
too O
, O
thought O
of O
Smith B-PER
, O
and O
how O
he O
ever O
held O
the B-PER
savages I-PER
, O
and O
more O
especially O
that O
Opechancanough O
who O
was O
now O
their B-PER
emperor I-PER
, O
in O
a O
most O
deep O
distrust O
; O
telling O
us O
that O
the B-PER
red I-PER
men I-PER
watched O
while O
we O
slept O
, O
that O
they O
might O
teach O
wiliness O
to O
a B-PER
Jesuit I-PER
, O
and O
how O
to O
bide O
its O
time O
to O
a O
cat O
crouched O
before O
a O
mousehole O
. O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
terms O
we O
now O
kept O
with O
these B-PER
heathen I-PER
; O
of O
how O
they O
came O
and O
went O
familiarly O
amongst O
us O
, O
spying O
out O
our O
weakness O
, O
and O
losing O
the O
salutary O
awe O
which O
that B-PER
noblest I-PER
captain I-PER
had O
struck O
into O
their O
souls O
; O
of O
how O
many O
were O
employed O
as O
hunters B-PER
to O
bring O
down O
deer O
for O
lazy B-PER
masters I-PER
; O
of O
how O
, O
breaking O
the O
law O
, O
and O
that O
not O
secretly O
, O
we O
gave O
them O
knives O
and O
arms O
, O
a O
soldier O
's O
bread O
, O
in O
exchange O
for O
pelts O
and O
pearls O
; O
of O
how O
their B-PER
emperor I-PER
was O
forever O
sending O
us O
smooth O
messages O
; O
of O
how O
their O
lips O
smiled O
and O
their O
eyes O
frowned O
. O
That O
afternoon O
, O
as O
I O
rode O
home B-FAC
through O
the O
lengthening O
shadows O
, O
a B-PER
hunter I-PER
, I-PER
red-brown I-PER
and I-PER
naked I-PER
, O
rose O
from O
behind O
a O
fallen O
tree O
that O
sprawled O
across O
my O
path O
, O
and O
made O
offer O
to O
bring O
me O
my O
meat O
from O
the O
moon O
of O
corn O
to O
the O
moon O
of O
stags O
in O
exchange O
for O
a O
gun O
. O
There O
was O
scant O
love O
between O
the B-PER
savages I-PER
and O
myself O
, O
-- O
it O
was O
answer O
enough O
when O
I O
told O
him O
my O
name O
. O
I O
left O
the B-PER
dark I-PER
figure I-PER
standing O
, O
still O
as O
a O
carved O
stone O
, O
in O
the O
heavy O
shadow O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
, O
spurring O
my O
horse O
( O
sent O
me O
from O
home B-FAC
, O
the O
year O
before O
, O
by O
my B-PER
cousin I-PER
Percy B-PER
) O
, O
was O
soon O
at O
my B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
-- O
a O
poor O
and O
rude O
one O
, O
but O
pleasantly O
set O
upon O
a B-LOC
slope I-LOC
of I-LOC
green I-LOC
turf I-LOC
, O
and O
girt O
with O
maize O
and O
the O
broad O
leaves O
of O
the O
tobacco O
. O
When O
I O
had O
had O
my O
supper O
, O
I O
called O
from O
their B-FAC
hut I-FAC
the B-PER
two I-PER
Paspahegh I-PER
lads I-PER
bought I-PER
by I-PER
me I-PER
from I-PER
their I-PER
tribe I-PER
the I-PER
Michaelmas I-PER
before I-PER
, O
and O
soundly O
flogged O
them O
both O
, O
having O
in O
my O
mind O
a O
saying O
of O
my B-PER
ancient I-PER
captain I-PER
's O
, O
namely O
, O
“ O
He O
who O
strikes O
first O
oft-times O
strikes O
last O
. O
” O
Upon O
the O
afternoon O
of O
which O
I O
now O
speak O
, O
in O
the O
midsummer O
of O
the O
year O
of O
grace O
1621 O
, O
as O
I O
sat O
upon O
my O
doorstep O
, O
my O
long O
pipe O
between O
my O
teeth O
and O
my O
eyes O
upon O
the O
pallid O
stream O
below O
, O
my O
thoughts O
were O
busy O
with O
these O
matters O
, O
-- O
so O
busy O
that O
I O
did O
not O
see O
a O
horse O
and O
rider B-PER
emerge O
from O
the O
dimness O
of O
the B-LOC
forest I-LOC
into O
the B-FAC
cleared I-FAC
space I-FAC
before I-FAC
my I-FAC
palisade I-FAC
, O
nor O
knew O
, O
until O
his O
voice O
came O
up O
the B-LOC
bank I-LOC
, O
that O
my B-PER
good I-PER
friend I-PER
, O
Master B-PER
John O
Rolfe O
, O
was O
without O
and O
would O
speak O
to O
me O
. O
I O
went O
down O
to O
the O
gate O
, O
and O
, O
unbarring O
it O
, O
gave O
him O
my O
hand O
and O
led O
the O
horse O
within O
the B-FAC
inclosure I-FAC
. O
“ O
Thou B-PER
careful I-PER
man I-PER
! O
” O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
, O
as O
he O
dismounted O
. O
“ O
Who O
else O
, O
think O
you O
, O
in O
this O
or O
any O
other O
hundred O
, O
now O
bars O
his O
gate O
when O
the O
sun O
goes O
down O
? O
” O
“ O
It O
is O
my O
sunset O
gun O
, O
” O
I O
answered O
briefly O
, O
fastening O
his O
horse O
as O
I O
spoke O
. O
He O
put O
his O
arm O
about O
my O
shoulder O
, O
for O
we O
were O
old B-PER
friends I-PER
, O
and O
together O
we O
went O
up O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
bank I-LOC
to O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
when O
I O
had O
brought O
him O
a O
pipe O
, O
sat O
down O
side O
by O
side O
upon O
the O
doorstep O
. O
“ O
Of O
what O
were O
you O
dreaming O
? O
” O
he O
asked O
presently O
, O
when O
we O
had O
made O
for O
ourselves O
a O
great O
cloud O
of O
smoke O
. O
“ O
I O
called O
you O
twice O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
was O
wishing O
for O
Dale B-PER
's O
times O
and O
Dale B-PER
's O
laws O
. O
” O
He O
laughed O
, O
and O
touched O
my O
knee O
with O
his O
hand O
, O
white O
and O
smooth O
as O
a O
woman O
's O
, O
and O
with O
a O
green O
jewel O
upon O
the O
forefinger O
. O
“ O
Thou O
Mars B-PER
incarnate O
! O
” O
he O
cried O
. O
“ O
Thou O
first O
, O
last O
, O
and O
in O
the B-PER
meantime I-PER
soldier I-PER
! O
Why O
, O
what O
wilt O
thou O
do O
when O
thou O
gettest O
to O

Make O
it O
too O
hot O

Or O
take O
out O

the B-PER
Enemy I-PER

” O
“ O
I O
am O
not O
there O
yet O
, O
” O
I O
said O
dryly O
. O
“ O
In O
the O
meantime O
I O
would O
like O
a O
commission O
against O
-- O
your B-PER
relatives I-PER
. O
” O
He O
laughed O
, O
then O
sighed O
, O
and O
, O
sinking O
his O
chin O
into O
his O
hand O
and O
softly O
tapping O
his O
foot O
against O
the O
ground O
, O
fell O
into O
a O
reverie O
. O
“ O
I O
would O
your B-PER
princess I-PER
were O
alive O
, O
” O
I O
said O
presently O
. O
“ O
So O
do O
I O
, O
” O
he O
answered O
softly O
. O
“ O
So O
do O
I. O
” O
Locking O
his O
hands O
behind O
his O
head O
, O
he O
raised O
his O
quiet O
face O
to O
the O
evening O
star O
. O
“ O
Brave O
and O
wise O
and O
gentle O
, O
” O
he O
mused O
. O
“ O
If O
I O
did O
not O
think O
to O
meet O
her O
again O
, O
beyond O
that O
star O

I O
could O
not O
smile O

calmly O

Ralph B-PER

as O
I O
do O
now O
. O
” O
“ O
' O
T O
is O
a O
strange O
thing O
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
as O
I O
refilled O
my O
pipe O
. O
“ O
Love O

I O
came O
with O
half O
a O

thee O

he O
cried O
, O
with O
another O
laugh O

“ O

thy O

I O
said O

blowing O
blue O
rings O
into O
the O
air O

“ O
I O
have O
ridden O
to-day O
from O

Not O

, O
when O
at O
midday O
I O
met O
good O
Master B-PER
Wickham O
rowing O
down O
from O
Henricus B-GPE
to O

to O
offer O
his O

I O
gave O
the B-PER
good I-PER

thought O
his O
a O
fruitful O

one O
pleasing O
to O

” O
“ O
Amen O

He O
rose O
to O
his O
feet O

began O
to O
pace O
the O
greensward O
before O
the O
door O

My O
eyes O
followed O
his O
trim O
figure O

richly O

sombrely O
clad O

then O
fell O
with O
a O
sudden O
dissatisfaction O
upon O
my O

“ O
Ralph B-PER

said O

Chapter O
1 O
It O
is O
a O
truth O
universally O
acknowledged O
, O
that O
a B-PER
single I-PER
man I-PER
in I-PER
possession I-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
good I-PER
fortune I-PER
, O
must O
be O
in O
want O
of O
a B-PER
wife I-PER
. O
However O
little O
known O
the O
feelings O
or O
views O
of O
such B-PER
a I-PER
man I-PER
may O
be O
on O
his O
first O
entering O
a B-FAC
neighbourhood I-FAC
, O
this O
truth O
is O
so O
well O
fixed O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the B-PER
surrounding I-PER
families I-PER
, O
that O
he O
is O
considered O
the O
rightful O
property O
of O
some B-PER
one I-PER
or O
other B-PER
of I-PER
their I-PER
daughters I-PER
. O
“ O
My B-PER
dear I-PER
Mr. B-PER
Bennet O
, O
” O
said O
his B-PER
lady I-PER
to O
him O
one O
day O
, O
“ O
have O
you O
heard O
that O
Netherfield B-FAC
Park I-FAC

let O
at O
last O
? O
” O
Mr. B-PER
Bennet O
replied O
that O
he O
had O
not O
. O
“ O
But O
it O
is O
, O
” O
returned O
she O
; O
“ O
for O
Mrs. B-PER
Long O
has O
just O
been O
here B-FAC
, O
and O
she O
told O
me O
all O
about O
it O
. O
” O
Mr. B-PER
Bennet O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
not O
want O
to O
know O
who O
has O
taken O
it O
? O
” O
cried O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
impatiently O
. O
“ O
_ O
You O
_ O
want O
to O
tell O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
hearing O
it O

” O
This O
was O
invitation O
enough O
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
, O
you O
must O
know O
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Long O
says O
that O
Netherfield B-FAC
is O
taken O
by O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
of O
large O
fortune O
from O
the O
north O
of O
England B-GPE
; O
that O
he O
came O
down O
on O
Monday O
in O
a O
chaise O
and O
four O
to O
see O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
, O
and O
was O
so O
much O
delighted O
with O
it O
, O
that O
he O
agreed O
with O
Mr. B-PER
Morris O
immediately O
; O
that O
he O
is O
to O
take O
possession O
before O
Michaelmas O
, O
and O
some B-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
servants I-PER
are O
to O
be O
in O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
by O
the O
end O
of O
next O
week O

“ O
What O

“ O
Bingley B-PER

“ O
Oh O

four O

thing O
for O
our B-PER

How O
can O
it O
affect O

” O
“ O
My B-PER
dear I-PER
Mr. B-PER
Bennet O

” O
replied O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
“ O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
tiresome O

You O
must O
know O

“ O
Is O
that O
his O

” O
“ O
Design O
! O
Nonsense O
, O
how O
can O
you O
talk O
so O

But O
it O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
he O
_ O
may O
_ O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
one O
of O
them O

and O
therefore O
you O
must O
visit O
him O
as O

comes O

” O
“ O
I O
see O
no O
occasion O
for O
that O

You O

the B-PER
girls I-PER
may O
go O

or O
you O
may O
send O
them O
by O
themselves O

which O
perhaps O
will O
be O
still O
better O
, O
for O
as O
you O
are O
as O
handsome O
as O
any O
of O
them O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Bingley O
may O
like O
you O
the O
best O
of O
the B-PER
party I-PER

” O
“ O
My B-PER
dear I-PER

you O
flatter O
me O

I O
certainly O
_ O
have O
_ O
had O
my O
share O
of O
beauty O
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
be O
anything O
extraordinary O
now O
. O
When O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
has O
five B-PER
grown-up I-PER
daughters I-PER
, O
she O
ought O
to O
give O
over O
thinking O
of O

beauty O

” O
“ O
In O
such O
cases O
, O
a B-PER

not O
often O

” O
“ O
But O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER

you O
must O
indeed O
go O

Mr. B-PER
Bingley O
when O
he O
comes O
into O
the B-FAC
neighbourhood I-FAC

” O
“ O
It O

consider O
your B-PER

would O
be O

Sir B-PER
William O

“ O
You O

will O
be O
very O
glad O

not O

I O
am O
sure O
she O
is O
not O
half O
so O
handsome O
as O
Jane B-PER

nor O
half O
so O
good-humoured O
as O
Lydia B-PER

But O
you O

he O
; O
“ O
they O

“ O
Mr. B-PER

how O

you O
abuse O

Mr. B-PER
Bennet O
was O
so O
odd O
a O
mixture O
of O
quick O
parts O
, O
sarcastic O
humour O
, O
reserve O
, O
and O
caprice O
, O
that O
the O
experience O
of O
three-and-twenty O
years O
had O
been O
insufficient O
to O
make O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
understand O
his O
character O
. O
_ O
Her O
_ O
mind O
was O
less O
difficult O
to O
develop O

She O
was O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
of I-PER
mean I-PER
understanding I-PER

little I-PER
information I-PER

and I-PER
uncertain I-PER
temper I-PER

When O
she O
was O
discontented O
, O
she O
fancied O
herself O
nervous O

The O
business O
of O
her O
life O
was O
to O
get O
her B-PER

its O
solace O
was O
visiting O

Chapter O
2 O
Mr. B-PER
Bennet O
was O
among O
the O
earliest O
of O
those O
who O
waited O
on O
Mr. B-PER
Bingley O
. O
He O
had O
always O
intended O
to O
visit O
him O
, O
though O
to O
the O
last O
always O
assuring O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
that O
he O
should O
not O
go O
; O
and O
till O
the O
evening O
after O
the O
visit O
was O
paid O
she O
had O
no O
knowledge O
of O
it O
. O
It O
was O
then O
disclosed O
in O
the O
following O
manner O
. O
Observing O
his B-PER
second I-PER
daughter I-PER
employed O
in O
trimming O
a O
hat O
, O
he O
suddenly O
addressed O
her O
with O
: O
“ O
I O
hope O
Mr. B-PER
Bingley O
will O
like O
it O

Lizzy B-PER

“ O

said O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
resentfully O
, O
“ O

” O
“ O
But O
you O

said O
Elizabeth B-PER

“ O
that O

shall O
meet O
him O

the O
assemblies O

“ O

; O

I O
am O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
you O
do O
not O
depend O
on O
her O
serving O
you O

” O
Mrs. B-PER
Bennet O
deigned O
not O
to O
make O
any O
reply O
, O
but O
, O
unable O
to O
contain O
herself O
, O
began O
scolding O
one O
of O
her B-PER
daughters I-PER

“ O

“ O

her B-PER
mother I-PER

“ O

honour O

stand O

The B-PER
girls I-PER
stared O
at O

Mrs. B-PER

said O
only O

why O

not O
you O
tell O
me O
that O
before O

If O
I O
had O
known O
as O
much O
this O
morning O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
called O
on O
him O
. O
It O
is O
very O
unlucky O
; O
but O
as O
I O
have O
actually O
paid O
the O
visit O

we O
can O
not O
escape O
the O
acquaintance O
now O

” O
The O
astonishment O
of O
the B-PER
ladies I-PER
was O
just O
what O
he O
wished O
; O
that O
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Bennet O
perhaps O
surpassing O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
; O
though O
, O
when O
the O
first O
tumult O
of O
joy O
was O
over O
, O
she O
began O
to O
declare O
that O
it O
was O
what O
she O
had O
expected O
all O
the O
while O
. O
“ O
How O
good O
it O
was O
in O
you O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
Mr. B-PER
Bennet O
! O
But O
I O
knew O
I O
should O
persuade O
you O
at O
last O
. O
I O
was O
sure O
you O
loved O
your B-PER
girls I-PER
too O
well O
to O
neglect O
such O
an O
acquaintance O
. O
Well O
, O
how O
pleased O
I O
am O
! O
and O
it O
is O
such O
a O
good O
joke O
, O
too O
, O
that O
you O
should O
have O
gone O
this O
morning O
and O
never O
said O
a O
word O
about O
it O
till O
now O

“ O
Now O
, O
Kitty B-PER

you O
may O
cough O
as O
much O
as O
you O
choose O

” O
said O
Mr. B-PER
Bennet O
; O
and O
, O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
left O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC

fatigued O
with O
the O
raptures O
of O
his B-PER
wife I-PER

“ O
What O
an B-PER
excellent I-PER
father I-PER
you O

tell O
you O

to O

CHAPTER O
1 O
. O
I O
AM O
BORN O
Whether O
I O
shall O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
the B-PER
hero I-PER
of I-PER
my I-PER
own I-PER
life I-PER
, O
or O
whether O
that O
station O
will O
be O
held O
by O
anybody B-PER
else I-PER
, O
these O
pages O
must O
show O
. O
To O
begin O
my O
life O
with O
the O
beginning O
of O
my O
life O
, O
I O
record O
that O
I O
was O
born O
( O
as O
I O
have O
been O
informed O
and O
believe O
) O
on O
a O
Friday O
, O
at O
twelve O
o’clock O
at O
night O
. O
It O
was O
remarked O
that O
the O
clock O
began O
to O
strike O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
cry O
, O
simultaneously O
. O
In O
consideration O
of O
the O
day O
and O
hour O
of O
my O
birth O
, O
it O
was O
declared O
by O
the B-PER
nurse I-PER
, O
and O
by O
some O
sage O
women O
in O
the B-FAC
neighbourhood I-FAC
who O
had O
taken O
a O
lively O
interest O
in O
me O
several O
months O
before O
there O
was O
any O
possibility O
of O
our O
becoming O
personally O
acquainted O
, O
first O
, O
that O
I O
was O
destined O
to O
be O
unlucky O
in O
life O
; O
and O
secondly O
, O
that O
I O
was O
privileged O
to O
see O
ghosts O
and O
spirits O
; O
both O
these O
gifts O
inevitably O
attaching O
, O
as O
they O
believed O
, O
to O
all B-PER
unlucky I-PER
infants I-PER
of I-PER
either I-PER
gender I-PER
, I-PER
born I-PER
towards I-PER
the I-PER
small I-PER
hours I-PER
on I-PER
a I-PER
Friday I-PER
night I-PER
. O
I O
need O
say O
nothing O
here O
, O
on O
the O
first O
head O
, O
because O
nothing O
can O
show O
better O
than O
my O
history O
whether O
that O
prediction O
was O
verified O
or O
falsified O
by O
the O
result O
. O
On O
the O
second O
branch O
of O
the O
question O
, O
I O
will O
only O
remark O
, O
that O
unless O
I O
ran O
through O
that O
part O
of O
my O
inheritance O
while O
I O
was O
still O
a B-PER
baby I-PER
, O
I O
have O
not O
come O
into O
it O
yet O
. O
But O
I O
do O
not O
at O
all O
complain O
of O
having O
been O
kept O
out O
of O
this B-FAC
property I-FAC
; O
and O
if O
anybody B-PER
else I-PER
should O
be O
in O
the O
present O
enjoyment O
of O
it O
, O
he O
is O
heartily O
welcome O
to O
keep O
it O
. O
I O
was O
born O
with O
a O
caul O
, O
which O
was O
advertised O
for O
sale O
, O
in O
the O
newspapers O
, O
at O
the O
low O
price O
of O
fifteen O
guineas O
. O
Whether O
sea-going B-PER
people I-PER
were O
short O
of O
money O
about O
that O
time O
, O
or O
were O
short O
of O
faith O
and O
preferred O
cork O
jackets O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
; O
all O
I O
know O
is O
, O
that O
there O
was O
but O
one O
solitary O
bidding O
, O
and O
that O
was O
from O
an B-PER
attorney I-PER
connected I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
bill-broking I-PER
business I-PER
, O
who O
offered O
two O
pounds O
in O
cash O
, O
and O
the O
balance O
in O
sherry O
, O
but O
declined O
to O
be O
guaranteed O
from O
drowning O
on O
any O
higher O
bargain O
. O
Consequently O
the O
advertisement O
was O
withdrawn O
at O
a O
dead O
loss O
-- O
for O
as O
to O
sherry O
, O
my B-PER
poor I-PER
dear I-PER
mother I-PER
’s O
own O
sherry O
was O
in O
the O
market O
then O
-- O
and O
ten O
years O
afterwards O
, O
the O
caul O
was O
put O
up O
in O
a O
raffle O
down O
in O
our O
part O
of O
the B-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
to O
fifty O
members O
at O
half-a-crown O
a O
head O
, O
the B-PER
winner I-PER
to O
spend O
five O
shillings O
. O
I O
was O
present O
myself O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
to O
have O
felt O
quite O
uncomfortable O
and O
confused O
, O
at O
a O
part O
of O
myself O
being O
disposed O
of O
in O
that O
way O
. O
The O
caul O
was O
won O
, O
I O
recollect O
, O
by O
an B-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
hand-basket I-PER
, O
who O
, O
very O
reluctantly O
, O
produced O
from O
it O
the O
stipulated O
five O
shillings O
, O
all O
in O
halfpence O
, O
and O
twopence O
halfpenny O
short O
-- O
as O
it O
took O
an O
immense O
time O
and O
a O
great O
waste O
of O
arithmetic O
, O
to O
endeavour O
without O
any O
effect O
to O
prove O
to O
her O
. O
It O
is O
a O
fact O
which O
will O
be O
long O
remembered O
as O
remarkable O
down O
there O
, O
that O
she O
was O
never O
drowned O
, O
but O
died O
triumphantly O
in O
bed O
, O
at O
ninety-two O
. O
I O
have O
understood O
that O
it O
was O
, O
to O
the O
last O
, O
her O
proudest O
boast O
, O
that O
she O
never O
had O
been O
on O
the B-LOC
water I-LOC
in O
her O
life O
, O
except O
upon O
a B-FAC
bridge I-FAC
; O
and O
that O
over O
her O
tea O
( O
to O
which O
she O
was O
extremely O
partial O
) O
she O
, O
to O
the O
last O
, O
expressed O
her O
indignation O
at O
the O
impiety O
of O
mariners B-PER
and O
others O
, O
who O
had O
the O
presumption O
to O
go O
‘ O
meandering O
’ O
about O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
It O
was O
in O
vain O
to O
represent O
to O
her O
that O
some O
conveniences O
, O
tea O
perhaps O
included O
, O
resulted O
from O
this O
objectionable O
practice O
. O
She O
always O
returned O
, O
with O
greater O
emphasis O
and O
with O
an O
instinctive O
knowledge O
of O
the O
strength O
of O
her O
objection O
, O
‘ O
Let O
us O
have O
no O
meandering O
. O
’ O
Not O
to O
meander O
myself O
, O
at O
present O
, O
I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
my O
birth O
. O
I O
was O
born O
at O
Blunderstone B-GPE
, O
in O
Suffolk B-GPE
, O
or O
‘ O
there O
by O
’ O
, O
as O
they O
say O
in O
Scotland B-GPE
. O
I O
was O
a B-PER
posthumous I-PER
child I-PER
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
eyes O
had O
closed O
upon O
the O
light O
of O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
six O
months O
, O
when O
mine O
opened O
on O
it O
. O
There O
is O
something O
strange O
to O
me O
, O
even O
now O
, O
in O
the O
reflection O
that O
he O
never O
saw O
me O
; O
and O
something O
stranger O
yet O
in O
the O
shadowy O
remembrance O
that O
I O
have O
of O
my O
first O
childish O
associations O
with O
his O
white O
grave-stone O
in O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
, O
and O
of O
the O
indefinable O
compassion O
I O
used O
to O
feel O
for O
it O
lying O
out O
alone O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
night O
, O
when O
our B-FAC
little I-FAC
parlour I-FAC
was O
warm O
and O
bright O
with O
fire O
and O
candle O
, O
and O
the O
doors O
of O
our B-FAC
house I-FAC
were O
-- O
almost O
cruelly O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
sometimes O
-- O
bolted O
and O
locked O
against O
it O
. O
An O
aunt O
of O
my B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
, O
and O
consequently O
a B-PER
great-aunt I-PER
of I-PER
mine I-PER
, O
of O
whom O
I O
shall O
have O
more O
to O
relate O
by O
and O
by O
, O
was O
the O
principal O
magnate O
of O
our B-PER
family I-PER
. O
Miss B-PER
Trotwood O
, O
or O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
, O
as O
my B-PER
poor I-PER
mother I-PER
always O
called O
her O
, O
when O
she O
sufficiently O
overcame O
her O
dread O
of O
this B-PER
formidable I-PER
personage I-PER
to O
mention O
her O
at O
all O
( O
which O
was O
seldom O
) O
, O
had O
been O
married O
to O
a B-PER
husband I-PER
younger I-PER
than I-PER
herself I-PER
, O
who O
was O
very O
handsome O
, O
except O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
homely O
adage O
, O
‘ O
handsome O
is O
, O
that O
handsome O
does O
’ O
-- O
for O
he O
was O
strongly O
suspected O
of O
having O
beaten O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
, O
and O
even O
of O
having O
once O
, O
on O
a O
disputed O
question O
of O
supplies O
, O
made O
some O
hasty O
but O
determined O
arrangements O
to O
throw O
her O
out O
of O
a O
two O
pair O
of O
stairs B-FAC
’ O
window O
. O
These O
evidences O
of O
an O
incompatibility O
of O
temper O
induced O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
to O
pay O
him O
off O
, O
and O
effect O
a O
separation O
by O
mutual O
consent O
. O
He O
went O
to O
India B-GPE
with O
his O
capital O
, O
and O
there B-GPE
, O
according O
to O
a O
wild O
legend O
in O
our B-PER
family I-PER
, O
he O
was O
once O
seen O
riding O
on O
an O
elephant O
, O
in O
company O
with O
a O
Baboon O
; O
but O
I O
think O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
Baboo O
-- O
or O
a O
Begum O
. O
Anyhow O
, O
from O
India B-GPE
tidings O
of O
his O
death O
reached O
home B-FAC
, O
within O
ten O
years O
. O
How O
they O
affected O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
, O
nobody B-PER
knew O
; O
for O
immediately O
upon O
the O
separation O
, O
she O
took O
her O
maiden O
name O
again O
, O
bought O
a O
cottage O
in O
a O
hamlet O
on O
the B-LOC
sea-coast I-LOC
a I-LOC
long I-LOC
way I-LOC
off I-LOC
, O
established O
herself O
there B-FAC
as O
a O
single O
woman O
with O
one B-PER
servant I-PER
, O
and O
was O
understood O
to O
live O
secluded O
, O
ever O
afterwards O
, O
in O
an O
inflexible O
retirement O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
had O
once O
been O
a B-PER
favourite I-PER
of I-PER
hers I-PER
, O
I O
believe O
; O
but O
she O
was O
mortally O
affronted O
by O
his O
marriage O
, O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
‘ B-PER
a I-PER
wax I-PER
doll I-PER
’ I-PER
. O
She O
had O
never O
seen O
my O
mother O
, O
but O
she O
knew O
her O
to O
be O
not O
yet O
twenty O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
and O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
never O
met O
again O
. O
He O
was O
double O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
’s O
age O
when O
he O
married O
, O
and O
of O
but O
a O
delicate O
constitution O
. O
He O
died O
a O
year O
afterwards O
, O
and O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
, O
six O
months O
before O
I O
came O
into O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
This O
was O
the O
state O
of O
matters O
, O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
, O
what O
I O
may O
be O
excused O
for O
calling O
, O
that O
eventful O
and O
important O
Friday O
. O
I O
can O
make O
no O
claim O
therefore O
to O
have O
known O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
how O
matters O
stood O
; O
or O
to O
have O
any O
remembrance O
, O
founded O
on O
the O
evidence O
of O
my O
own O
senses O
, O
of O
what O
follows O
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
sitting O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
but O
poorly O
in O
health O
, O
and O
very O
low O
in O
spirits O
, O
looking O
at O
it O
through O
her O
tears O
, O
and O
desponding O
heavily O
about O
herself O
and O
the O
fatherless O
little O
stranger O
, O
who O
was O
already O
welcomed O
by O
some O
grosses O
of O
prophetic O
pins O
, O
in O
a O
drawer O
upstairs B-FAC
, O
to O
a O
world O
not O
at O
all O
excited O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
arrival O
; O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
I O
say O
, O
was O
sitting O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
that O
bright O
, O
windy O
March O
afternoon O
, O
very O
timid O
and O
sad O
, O
and O
very O
doubtful O
of O
ever O
coming O
alive O
out O
of O
the O
trial O
that O
was O
before O
her O
, O
when O
, O
lifting O
her O
eyes O
as O
she O
dried O
them O
, O
to O
the O
window O
opposite O
, O
she O
saw O
a O
strange O
lady O
coming O
up O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
a O
sure O
foreboding O
at O
the O
second O
glance O
, O
that O
it O
was O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
. O
The O
setting O
sun O
was O
glowing O
on O
the B-PER
strange I-PER
lady I-PER
, O
over O
the O
garden-fence O
, O
and O
she O
came O
walking O
up O
to O
the O
door O
with O
a O
fell O
rigidity O
of O
figure O
and O
composure O
of O
countenance O
that O
could O
have O
belonged O
to O
nobody B-PER
else O
. O
When O
she O
reached O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
she O
gave O
another O
proof O
of O
her O
identity O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
had O
often O
hinted O
that O
she O
seldom O
conducted O
herself O
like O
any B-PER
ordinary I-PER
Christian I-PER
; O
and O
now O
, O
instead O
of O
ringing O
the O
bell O
, O
she O
came O
and O
looked O
in O
at O
that O
identical O
window O
, O
pressing O
the O
end O
of O
her O
nose O
against O
the O
glass O
to O
that O
extent O
, O
that O
my B-PER
poor I-PER
dear I-PER
mother I-PER
used O
to O
say O
it O
became O
perfectly O
flat O
and O
white O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
She O
gave O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
such O
a O
turn O
, O
that O
I O
have O
always O
been O
convinced O
I O
am O
indebted O
to O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
for O
having O
been O
born O
on O
a O
Friday O
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
left O
her O
chair O
in O
her O
agitation O
, O
and O
gone O
behind O
it O
in O
the O
corner O
. O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
, O
looking O
round O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
slowly O
and O
inquiringly O
, O
began O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
and O
carried O
her O
eyes O
on O
, O
like O
a O
Saracen O
’s O
Head O
in O
a O
Dutch O
clock O
, O
until O
they O
reached O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
Then O
she O
made O
a O
frown O
and O
a O
gesture O
to O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
like O
one O
who O
was O
accustomed O
to O
be O
obeyed O
, O
to O
come O
and O
open O
the O
door O
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
went O
. O
‘ O
Mrs. B-PER
David O
Copperfield O
, O
I O
think O
, O
’ O
said O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
; O
the O
emphasis O
referring O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
’s O
mourning O
weeds O
, O
and O
her O
condition O
. O
‘ O
Yes O
, O
’ O
said O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
faintly O
. O
‘ O
Miss B-PER
Trotwood O
, O
’ O
said O
the O
visitor O
. O
‘ O
You O
have O
heard O
of O
her O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
? O
’ O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
answered O
she O
had O
had O
that O
pleasure O
. O
And O
she O
had O
a O
disagreeable O
consciousness O
of O
not O
appearing O
to O
imply O
that O
it O
had O
been O
an O
overpowering O
pleasure O
. O
‘ O
Now O
you O
see O
her O
, O
’ O
said O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
bent O
her O
head O
, O
and O
begged O
her O
to O
walk O
in O
. O
They O
went O
into O
the O
parlour O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
come O
from O
, O
the O
fire O
in O
the O
best O
room O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
passage I-FAC
not O
being O
lighted O
-- O
not O
having O
been O
lighted O
, O
indeed O
, O
since O
my B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
funeral O
; O
and O
when O
they O
were O
both O
seated O
, O
and O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
said O
nothing O
, O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
after O
vainly O
trying O
to O
restrain O
herself O
, O
began O
to O
cry O
. O
‘ O
Oh O
tut O
, O
tut O
, O
tut O
! O
’ O
said O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
, O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
‘ O
Do O
n’t O
do O
that O
! O
Come O
, O
come O
! O
’ O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
could O
n’t O
help O
it O
notwithstanding O
, O
so O
she O
cried O
until O
she O
had O
had O
her O
cry O
out O
. O
‘ O
Take O
off O
your O
cap O
, O
child B-PER
, O
’ O
said O
Miss B-PER
Betsey O
, O
‘ O
and O
let O
me O
see O
you O
. O
’ O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
too O
much O
afraid O
of O
her O
to O
refuse O
compliance O
with O
this O
odd O
request O
, O
if O
she O
had O
any O
disposition O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Therefore O
she O
did O
as O
she O
was O
told O
, O
and O
did O
it O
with O
such O
nervous O
hands O
that O
her O
hair O
( O
which O
was O
luxuriant O
and O
beautiful O
) O
fell O
all O
about O
her O
face O
. O

THE B-PER
STRANGE I-PER
MAN I-PER
'S O
ARRIVAL O
The B-PER
stranger I-PER
came O
early O
in O
February O
, O
one O
wintry O
day O
, O
through O
a O
biting O
wind O
and O
a O
driving O
snow O
, O
the O
last O
snowfall O
of O
the O
year O
, O
over O
the O
down O
, O
walking O
from O
Bramblehurst B-GPE
railway O
station O
, O
and O
carrying O
a O
little O
black O
portmanteau O
in O
his O
thickly O
gloved O
hand O
. O
He O
was O
wrapped O
up O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
and O
the O
brim O
of O
his O
soft O
felt O
hat O
hid O
every O
inch O
of O
his O
face O
but O
the O
shiny O
tip O
of O
his O
nose O
; O
the O
snow O
had O
piled O
itself O
against O
his O
shoulders O
and O
chest O
, O
and O
added O
a O
white O
crest O
to O
the O
burden O
he O
carried O
. O
He O
staggered O
into O
the O
" O
Coach B-VEH
and I-VEH
Horses I-VEH
" O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
, O
and O
flung O
his O
portmanteau O
down O
. O
" O
A O
fire O
, O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
" O
in O
the O
name O
of O
human O
charity O
! O
A B-FAC
room I-FAC
and O
a O
fire O
! O
" O
He O
stamped O
and O
shook O
the O
snow O
from O
off O
himself O
in O
the B-FAC
bar I-FAC
, O
and O
followed O
Mrs. B-PER
Hall O
into O
her B-FAC
guest I-FAC
parlour I-FAC
to O
strike O
his O
bargain O
. O
And O
with O
that O
much O
introduction O
, O
that O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
sovereigns O
flung O
upon O
the O
table O
, O
he O
took O
up O
his O
quarters O
in O
the B-FAC
inn I-FAC
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Hall O
lit O
the O
fire O
and O
left O
him O
there B-FAC
while O
she O
went O
to O
prepare O
him O
a O
meal O
with O
her O
own O
hands O
. O
A O
guest O
to O
stop O
at O
Iping B-GPE
in O
the O
wintertime O
was O
an O
unheard-of O
piece O
of O
luck O
, O
let O
alone O
a B-PER
guest I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
no I-PER
" I-PER
haggler I-PER
, O
" O
and O
she O
was O
resolved O
to O
show O
herself O
worthy O
of O
her O
good O
fortune O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
bacon O
was O
well O
under O
way O
, O
and O
Millie B-PER
, O
her B-PER
lymphatic I-PER
maid I-PER
, O
had O
been O
brisked O
up O
a O
bit O
by O
a O
few O
deftly O
chosen O
expressions O
of O
contempt O
, O
she O
carried O
the O
cloth O
, O
plates O
, O
and O
glasses O
into O
the B-FAC
parlour I-FAC
and O
began O
to O
lay O
them O
with O
the O
utmost O
_ O
eclat O
_ O
. O
Although O
the O
fire O
was O
burning O
up O
briskly O
, O
she O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
her B-PER
visitor I-PER
still O
wore O
his O
hat O
and O
coat O
, O
standing O
with O
his O
back O
to O
her O
and O
staring O
out O
of O
the O
window O
at O
the O
falling O
snow O
in O
the B-FAC
yard I-FAC
. O
His O
gloved O
hands O
were O
clasped O
behind O
him O
, O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
lost O
in O
thought O
. O
She O
noticed O
that O
the O
melting O
snow O
that O
still O
sprinkled O
his O
shoulders O
dripped O
upon O
her O
carpet O
. O
" O
Can O
I O
take O
your O
hat O
and O
coat O
, O
sir B-PER
? O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
and O
give O
them O
a O
good O
dry O
in O
the B-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
he O
said O
without O
turning O
. O
She O
was O
not O
sure O
she O
had O
heard O
him O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
repeat O
her O
question O
. O
He O
turned O
his O
head O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
over O
his O
shoulder O
. O
" O
I O
prefer O
to O
keep O
them O
on O
, O
" O
he O
said O
with O
emphasis O
, O
and O
she O
noticed O
that O
he O
wore O
big O
blue O
spectacles O
with O
sidelights O
, O
and O
had O
a O
bush O
side-whisker O
over O
his O
coat-collar O
that O
completely O
hid O
his O
cheeks O
and O
face O
. O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
_ O
As O
_ O
you O
like O
. O
In O
a O
bit O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
will O
be O
warmer O
. O
" O
He O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
had O
turned O
his O
face O
away O
from O
her O
again O
, O
and O
Mrs. B-PER
Hall O
, O
feeling O
that O
her O
conversational O
advances O
were O
ill-timed O
, O
laid O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
table O
things O
in O
a O
quick O
staccato O
and O
whisked O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
When O
she O
returned O
he O
was O
still O
standing O
there B-FAC
, O
like O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
stone I-PER
, O
his O
back O
hunched O
, O
his O
collar O
turned O
up O
, O
his O
dripping O
hat-brim O
turned O
down O
, O
hiding O
his O
face O
and O
ears O
completely O
. O
She O
put O
down O
the O
eggs O
and O
bacon O
with O
considerable O
emphasis O
, O
and O
called O
rather O
than O
said O
to O
him O
, O
" O
Your O
lunch O
is O
served O
, O
sir B-PER
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
" O
he O
said O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
and O
did O
not O
stir O
until O
she O
was O
closing O
the O
door O
. O
Then O
he O
swung O
round O
and O
approached O
the O
table O
with O
a O
certain O
eager O
quickness O
. O
As O
she O
went O
behind O
the B-FAC
bar I-FAC
to O
the B-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
she O
heard O
a O
sound O
repeated O
at O
regular O
intervals O
. O
Chirk O
, O
chirk O
, O
chirk O
, O
it O
went O
, O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
spoon O
being O
rapidly O
whisked O
round O
a O
basin O
. O
" O
That B-PER
girl I-PER
! O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
There O
! O
I O
clean O
forgot O
it O
. O
It O
's O
her O
being O
so O
long O
! O
" O
And O
while O
she O
herself O
finished O
mixing O
the O
mustard O
, O
she O
gave O
Millie B-PER
a O
few O
verbal O
stabs O
for O
her O
excessive O
slowness O
. O
She O
had O
cooked O
the O
ham O
and O
eggs O
, O
laid O
the O
table O
, O
and O
done O
everything O
, O
while O
Millie B-PER
( O
help O
indeed O
! O
) O
had O
only O
succeeded O
in O
delaying O
the O
mustard O
. O
And O
him O
a B-PER
new I-PER
guest I-PER
and O
wanting O
to O
stay O
! O
Then O
she O
filled O
the O
mustard O
pot O
, O
and O
, O
putting O
it O
with O
a O
certain O
stateliness O
upon O
a O
gold O
and O
black O
tea-tray O
, O
carried O
it O
into O
the B-FAC
parlour I-FAC
. O
She O
rapped O
and O
entered O
promptly O
. O
As O
she O
did O
so O
her B-PER
visitor I-PER
moved O
quickly O
, O
so O
that O
she O
got O
but O
a O
glimpse O
of O
a O
white O
object O
disappearing O
behind O
the O
table O
. O
It O
would O
seem O
he O
was O
picking O
something O
from O
the O
floor O
. O
She O
rapped O
down O
the O
mustard O
pot O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
then O
she O
noticed O
the O
overcoat O
and O
hat O
had O
been O
taken O
off O
and O
put O
over O
a O
chair O
in O
front O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
wet O
boots O
threatened O
rust O
to O
her O
steel O
fender O
. O
She O
went O
to O
these O
things O
resolutely O
. O
" O
I O
suppose O
I O
may O
have O
them O
to O
dry O
now O
, O
" O
she O
said O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
brooked O
no O
denial O
. O
" O
Leave O
the O
hat O
, O
" O
said O
her B-PER
visitor I-PER
, O
in O
a O
muffled O
voice O
, O
and O
turning O
she O
saw O
he O
had O
raised O
his O
head O
and O
was O
sitting O
and O
looking O
at O
her O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
she O
stood O
gaping O
at O
him O
, O
too O
surprised O
to O
speak O
. O
He O
held O
a O
white O
cloth O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
serviette O
he O
had O
brought O
with O
him O
-- O
over O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
his O
face O
, O
so O
that O
his O
mouth O
and O
jaws O
were O
completely O
hidden O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
muffled O
voice O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
that O
which O
startled O
Mrs. B-PER
Hall O
. O
It O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
his O
forehead O
above O
his O
blue O
glasses O
was O
covered O
by O
a O
white O
bandage O
, O
and O
that O
another O
covered O
his O
ears O
, O
leaving O
not O
a O
scrap O
of O
his O
face O
exposed O
excepting O
only O
his O
pink O
, O
peaked O
nose O
. O
It O
was O
bright O
, O
pink O
, O
and O
shiny O
just O
as O
it O
had O
been O
at O
first O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
dark-brown O
velvet O
jacket O
with O
a O
high O
, O
black O
, O
linen-lined O
collar O
turned O
up O
about O
his O
neck O
. O
The O
thick O
black O
hair O
, O
escaping O
as O
it O
could O
below O
and O
between O
the O
cross O
bandages O
, O
projected O
in O
curious O
tails O
and O
horns O
, O
giving O
him O
the O
strangest O
appearance O
conceivable O
. O
This O
muffled O
and O
bandaged O
head O
was O
so O
unlike O
what O
she O
had O
anticipated O
, O
that O
for O
a O
moment O
she O
was O
rigid O
. O
He O
did O
not O
remove O
the O
serviette O
, O
but O
remained O
holding O
it O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
now O
, O
with O
a O
brown O
gloved O
hand O
, O
and O
regarding O
her O
with O
his O
inscrutable O
blue O
glasses O
. O
" O
Leave O
the O
hat O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
speaking O
very O
distinctly O
through O
the O
white O
cloth O
. O
Her O
nerves O
began O
to O
recover O
from O
the O
shock O
they O
had O
received O
. O
She O
placed O
the O
hat O
on O
the O
chair O
again O
by O
the O
fire O
. O
" O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
" O
she O
began O
, O
" O
that O
-- O
" O
and O
she O
stopped O
embarrassed O
. O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
" O
he O
said O
drily O
, O
glancing O
from O
her O
to O
the O
door O
and O
then O
at O
her O
again O
. O
" O
I O
'll O
have O
them O
nicely O
dried O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
at O
once O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
and O
carried O
his O
clothes O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
She O
glanced O
at O
his O
white-swathed O
head O
and O
blue O
goggles O
again O
as O
she O
was O
going O
out O
of O
the O
door O
; O
but O
his O
napkin O
was O
still O
in O
front O
of O
his O
face O
. O
She O
shivered O
a O
little O
as O
she O
closed O
the O
door O
behind O
her O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
eloquent O
of O
her O
surprise O
and O
perplexity O
. O
" O
I O
_ O
never O
_ O
, O
" O
she O
whispered O
. O
" O
There O
! O
" O
She O
went O
quite O
softly O
to O
the B-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
, O
and O
was O
too O
preoccupied O
to O
ask O
Millie B-PER
what O
she O
was O
messing O
about O
with O
_ O
now O
_ O
, O
when O
she O
got O
there B-FAC
. O
The B-PER
visitor I-PER
sat O
and O
listened O
to O
her O
retreating O
feet O
. O
He O
glanced O
inquiringly O
at O
the O
window O
before O
he O
removed O
his O
serviette O
, O
and O
resumed O
his O
meal O
. O
He O
took O
a O
mouthful O
, O
glanced O
suspiciously O
at O
the O
window O
, O
took O
another O
mouthful O
, O
then O
rose O
and O
, O
taking O
the O
serviette O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
walked O
across O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
and O
pulled O
the O
blind O
down O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
white O
muslin O
that O
obscured O
the O
lower O
panes O
. O
This O
left O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
in O
a O
twilight O
. O
This O
done O
, O
he O
returned O
with O
an O
easier O
air O
to O
the O
table O
and O
his O
meal O
. O
" O
The B-PER
poor I-PER
soul I-PER
's O
had O
an O
accident O
or O
an O
op O
' O
ration O
or O
somethin' O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. B-PER
Hall O
. O
" O
What O
a O
turn O
them O
bandages O
did O
give O
me O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
! O
" O
She O

on O

unfolded O
the O

extended O
the B-PER
traveller I-PER

coat O
upon O
this O
. O
" O
And O
they O
goggles O
! O
Why O
, O
he O
looked O
more O
like O
a O
divin O
' O
helmet O
than O
a B-PER
human I-PER
man I-PER
! O
" O
She O
hung O
his O
muffler O
on O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
horse O

" O
And O
holding O
that O
handkerchief O
over O
his O
mouth O
all O
the O
time O

Talkin O
' O
through O
it O
! O
... O
Perhaps O
his O
mouth O
was O
hurt O
too O
-- O
maybe O
. O
" O
She O
turned O
round O
, O
as O
one O
who O
suddenly O
remembers O
. O
" O
Bless O
my O
soul O
alive O
! O
" O
she O
said O
, O
going O
off O
at O
a O
tangent O
; O
" O
ai O
n't O
you O
done O
them O
taters O

" O
When O
Mrs. B-PER
Hall O
went O
to O
clear O
away O
the B-PER
stranger I-PER
's O
lunch O
, O
her O
idea O
that O
his O
mouth O
must O
also O
have O
been O
cut O
or O
disfigured O
in O
the O
accident O
she O
supposed O
him O
to O
have O
suffered O
, O
was O
confirmed O
, O
for O
he O
was O
smoking O
a O
pipe O
, O
and O
all O
the O
time O
that O
she O
was O
in O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
he O
never O
loosened O
the O
silk O
muffler O
he O
had O
wrapped O
round O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
his O
face O
to O
put O
the O
mouthpiece O
to O
his O
lips O
. O
Yet O
it O
was O
not O
forgetfulness O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
he O
glanced O
at O
it O
as O
it O
smouldered O
out O
. O
He O
sat O
in O
the O
corner O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
window-blind O
and O
spoke O
now O
, O
having O
eaten O
and O
drunk O
and O
being O
comfortably O
warmed O
through O
, O
with O
less O
aggressive O
brevity O
than O
before O
. O
The O
reflection O
of O
the O
fire O
lent O
a O
kind O
of O
red O
animation O
to O
his O
big O
spectacles O
they O
had O
lacked O
hitherto O
. O
" O
I O
have O
some O
luggage O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
at O
Bramblehurst B-GPE
station O
, O
" O
and O
he O
asked O
her O
how O
he O
could O
have O
it O
sent O
. O
He O
bowed O
his O
bandaged O
head O
quite O
politely O
in O
acknowledgment O
of O
her O
explanation O
. O
" O
To-morrow O
? O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
There O
is O
no O
speedier O
delivery O
? O
" O
and O
seemed O
quite O
disappointed O
when O
she O
answered O
, O
" O
No O

" O
Was O
she O
quite O
sure O
? O
No O
man O
with O
a B-VEH
trap I-VEH
who O
would O
go O
over O
? O
Mrs. B-PER
Hall O
, O
nothing O
loath O
, O
answered O
his O
questions O
and O
developed O
a O
conversation O
. O
" O
It O
's O
a B-FAC
steep I-FAC
road I-FAC
by I-FAC
the I-FAC
down I-FAC
, O
sir B-PER
, O
" O
she O
said O
in O
answer O
to O
the O
question O
about O
a B-VEH
trap I-VEH
; O
and O
then O
, O
snatching O
at O
an O
opening O
, O
said O
, O
" O
It O
was O
there O
a B-VEH
carriage I-VEH
was O
upsettled O
, O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
more O
. O
A B-PER
gentleman I-PER
killed O

besides O
his B-PER
coachman I-PER
. O
Accidents O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
happen O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
do O
n't O
they O
? O
" O
But O
the B-PER
visitor I-PER
was O
not O
to O
be O
drawn O
so O
easily O
. O
" O
They O
do O
, O
" O
he O
said O
through O
his O
muffler O
, O
eyeing O
her O
quietly O
through O
his O
impenetrable O
glasses O
. O
I O
am O
a B-PER
rather I-PER
elderly I-PER
man I-PER
. O
The O
nature O
of O
my O
avocations O
for O
the O
last O
thirty O
years O
has O
brought O
me O
into O
more O
than O
ordinary O
contact O
with O
what O
would O
seem O
an O
interesting O
and O
somewhat O
singular O
set O
of O
men B-PER
, O
of O
whom O
as O
yet O
nothing O
that O
I O
know O
of O
has O
ever O
been O
written O
: O
-- O
I O
mean O
the B-PER
law-copyists I-PER
or O
scriveners B-PER
. O
I O
have O
known O
very O
many O
of O
them O
, O
professionally O
and O
privately O
, O
and O
if O
I O
pleased O
, O
could O
relate O
divers O
histories O
, O
at O
which O
good-natured B-PER
gentlemen I-PER
might O
smile O
, O
and O
sentimental B-PER
souls I-PER
might O
weep O
. O
But O
I O
waive O
the O
biographies O
of O
all B-PER
other I-PER
scriveners I-PER
for O
a O
few O
passages O
in O
the O
life O
of O
Bartleby B-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
a I-PER
scrivener I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
strangest I-PER
I I-PER
ever I-PER
saw I-PER
or I-PER
heard I-PER
of I-PER
. O
While O
of O
other B-PER
law-copyists I-PER
I O
might O
write O
the O
complete O
life O
, O
of O
Bartleby B-PER
nothing O
of O
that O
sort O
can O
be O
done O
. O
I O
believe O
that O
no O
materials O
exist O
for O
a O
full O
and O
satisfactory O
biography O
of O
this B-PER
man I-PER
. O
It O
is O
an O
irreparable O
loss O
to O
literature O
. O
Bartleby B-PER
was O
one O
of O
those O
beings O
of O
whom O
nothing O
is O
ascertainable O
, O
except O
from O
the O
original O
sources O
, O
and O
in O
his O
case O
those O
are O
very O
small O
. O
What O
my O
own O
astonished O
eyes O
saw O
of O
Bartleby B-PER
, O
_ O
that O
_ O
is O
all O
I O
know O
of O
him O
, O
except O
, O
indeed O
, O
one O
vague O
report O
which O
will O
appear O
in O
the O
sequel O
. O
Ere O
introducing O
the B-PER
scrivener I-PER
, O
as O
he O
first O
appeared O
to O
me O
, O
it O
is O
fit O
I O
make O
some O
mention O
of O
myself O
, O
my B-PER
_ I-PER
employees I-PER
_ I-PER
, O
my O
business B-ORG
, O
my O
chambers B-FAC
, O
and O
general B-LOC
surroundings I-LOC
; O
because O
some O
such O
description O
is O
indispensable O
to O
an O
adequate O
understanding O
of O
the B-PER
chief I-PER
character I-PER
about I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
presented I-PER
. O
Imprimis O
: O
I O
am O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
, I-PER
from I-PER
his I-PER
youth I-PER
upwards I-PER
, I-PER
has I-PER
been I-PER
filled I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
profound I-PER
conviction I-PER
that I-PER
the I-PER
easiest I-PER
way I-PER
of I-PER
life I-PER
is I-PER
the I-PER
best I-PER
. O
Hence O
, O
though O
I O
belong O
to O
a O
profession O
proverbially O
energetic O
and O
nervous O
, O
even O
to O
turbulence O
, O
at O
times O
, O
yet O
nothing O
of O
that O
sort O
have O
I O
ever O
suffered O
to O
invade O
my O
peace O
. O
I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
unambitious O
lawyers O
who O
never O
addresses O
a B-PER
jury I-PER
, O
or O
in O
any O
way O
draws O
down O
public O
applause O
; O
but O
in O
the O
cool O
tranquility O
of O
a O
snug O
retreat O

a O
snug O
business O
among O
rich B-PER
men I-PER

All O

The B-PER
late I-PER
John B-PER
Jacob I-PER
Astor I-PER
, O
a B-PER
personage I-PER
little I-PER
given I-PER
to I-PER
poetic I-PER
enthusiasm I-PER
, O
had O
no O
hesitation O
in O
pronouncing O
my O
first O
grand O
point O
to O
be O
prudence O
; O
my O
next O
, O
method O
. O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
it O
in O
vanity O
, O
but O
simply O
record O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
unemployed O
in O
my O
profession O
by O
the B-PER
late I-PER
John I-PER
Jacob I-PER
Astor I-PER
; O
a O
name O
which O
, O
I O
admit O
, O
I O
love O
to O
repeat O
, O
for O
it O
hath O
a O
rounded O
and O
orbicular O
sound O
to O
it O
, O
and O
rings O
like O
unto O
bullion O
. O
I O
will O
freely O
add O
, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
insensible O
to O
the B-PER
late I-PER
John I-PER
Jacob I-PER
Astor I-PER
's O
good O
opinion O
. O
Some O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
period O
at O
which O
this O
little O
history O
begins O
, O
my O
avocations O
had O
been O
largely O
increased O
. O
The O
good O
old O
office O
, O
now O
extinct O
in O
the B-GPE
State I-GPE
of I-GPE
New I-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
of O
a O
Master O
in O
Chancery O
, O
had O
been O
conferred O
upon O
me O
. O
It O
was O
not O
a O
very O
arduous O
office O
, O
but O
very O
pleasantly O
remunerative O
. O
I O
seldom O
lose O
my O
temper O
; O
much O
more O
seldom O
indulge O
in O
dangerous O
indignation O
at O
wrongs O
and O
outrages O
; O
but O
I O
must O
be O
permitted O
to O
be O
rash O
here O
and O
declare O
, O
that O
I O
consider O
the O
sudden O
and O
violent O
abrogation O
of O
the O
office O
of O
Master O
in O
Chancery O
, O
by O
the O
new O
Constitution O
, O
as O
a O
-- O
premature O
act O
; O
inasmuch O
as O
I O
had O
counted O
upon O
a O
life-lease O
of O
the O
profits O
, O
whereas O
I O
only O
received O
those O
of O
a O
few O
short O
years O
. O
But O
this O
is O
by O
the O
way O
. O
My B-FAC
chambers I-FAC
were O
up O
stairs B-FAC
at O
No O
. O
-- O
Wall-street B-FAC
. O
At O
one O
end O
they O
looked O
upon O
the O
white O
wall O
of O
the O
interior O
of O
a O
spacious O
sky-light O
shaft O
, O
penetrating O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
. O
This O
view O
might O
have O
been O
considered O
rather O
tame O
than O
otherwise O
, O
deficient O
in O
what O
landscape B-PER
painters I-PER
call O
" O
life O
. O
" O
But O
if O
so O
, O
the O
view O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
my B-FAC
chambers I-FAC
offered O
, O
at O
least O
, O
a O
contrast O
, O
if O
nothing O
more O
. O
In O
that O
direction O
my O
windows O
commanded O
an O
unobstructed O
view O
of O
a O
lofty O
brick O
wall O
, O
black O
by O
age O
and O
everlasting O
shade O
; O
which O
wall O
required O
no O
spy-glass O
to O
bring O
out O
its O
lurking O
beauties O
, O
but O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all B-PER
near-sighted I-PER
spectators I-PER
, O
was O
pushed O
up O
to O
within O
ten O
feet O
of O
my O
window O
panes O
. O
Owing O
to O
the O
great O
height O
of O
the B-FAC
surrounding I-FAC
buildings I-FAC
, O
and O
my B-FAC
chambers I-FAC
being O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
, O
the O
interval O
between O
this O
wall O
and O
mine O
not O
a O
little O
resembled O
a O
huge O
square O
cistern O
. O
At O
the O
period O
just O
preceding O
the O
advent O
of O
Bartleby B-PER
, O
I O
had O
two B-PER
persons I-PER
as O
copyists B-PER
in O
my O
employment O
, O
and O
a B-PER
promising I-PER
lad I-PER
as O
an B-PER
office-boy I-PER
. O
First O
, O
Turkey B-PER
; O
second O
, O
Nippers B-PER
; O
third O
, O
Ginger B-PER
Nut I-PER
. O
These O
may O
seem O
names O
, O
the O
like O
of O
which O
are O
not O
usually O
found O
in O
the O
Directory O
. O
In O
truth O
they O
were O
nicknames O
, O
mutually O
conferred O
upon O
each O
other O
by O
my B-PER
three I-PER
clerks I-PER
, O
and O
were O
deemed O
expressive O
of O
their B-PER
respective I-PER
persons I-PER
or O
characters B-PER
. O
Turkey B-PER
was O
a B-PER
short I-PER
, I-PER
pursy I-PER
Englishman I-PER
of I-PER
about I-PER
my I-PER
own I-PER
age I-PER
, O
that O
is O
, O
somewhere O
not O
far O
from O
sixty O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
, O
one O
might O
say O
, O
his O
face O
was O
of O
a O
fine O
florid O
hue O
, O
but O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
meridian O
-- O
his O
dinner O
hour O
-- O
it O
blazed O
like O
a O
grate O
full O
of O
Christmas O
coals O
; O
and O
continued O
blazing O
-- O
but O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
with O
a O
gradual O
wane O
-- O
till O
6 O
o'clock O
, O
P.M. O
or O
thereabouts O
, O
after O
which O
I O
saw O
no O
more O
of O
the B-PER
proprietor I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
face I-PER
, I-PER
which I-PER
gaining I-PER
its I-PER
meridian I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
sun I-PER
, I-PER
seemed I-PER
to I-PER
set I-PER
with I-PER
it I-PER
, I-PER
to I-PER
rise I-PER
, I-PER
culminate I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
decline I-PER
the I-PER
following I-PER
day I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
like I-PER
regularity I-PER
and I-PER
undiminished I-PER
glory I-PER
. O
There O
are O
many O
singular O
coincidences O
I O
have O
known O
in O
the O
course O
of O
my O
life O
, O
not O
the O
least O
among O
which O
was O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
exactly O
when O
Turkey B-PER
displayed O
his O
fullest O
beams O
from O
his O
red O
and O
radiant O
countenance O
, O
just O
then O
, O
too O
, O
at O
that O
critical O
moment O
, O
began O
the O
daily O
period O
when O
I O
considered O
his O
business O
capacities O
as O
seriously O
disturbed O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
twenty-four O
hours O
. O
Not O
that O
he O
was O
absolutely O
idle O
, O
or O
averse O
to O
business O
then O
; O
far O
from O
it O
. O
The O
difficulty O
was O
, O
he O
was O
apt O
to O
be O
altogether O
too O
energetic O
. O
There O
was O
a O
strange O
, O
inflamed O
, O
flurried O
, O
flighty O
recklessness O
of O
activity O
about O
him O
. O
He O
would O
be O
incautious O
in O
dipping O
his O
pen O
into O
his O
inkstand O
. O
All O
his O
blots O
upon O
my O
documents O
, O
were O
dropped O
there O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
meridian O
. O
Indeed O
, O
not O
only O
would O
he O
be O
reckless O
and O
sadly O
given O
to O
making O
blots O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
but O
some O
days O
he O
went O
further O
, O
and O
was O
rather O
noisy O
. O
At O
such O
times O
, O
too O
, O
his O
face O
flamed O
with O
augmented O
blazonry O
, O
as O
if O
cannel O
coal O
had O
been O
heaped O
on O
anthracite O
. O
He O
made O
an O
unpleasant O
racket O
with O
his O
chair O
; O
spilled O
his O
sand-box O
; O
in O
mending O
his O
pens O
, O
impatiently O
split O
them O
all O
to O
pieces O
, O
and O
threw O
them O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
a O
sudden O
passion O
; O
stood O
up O
and O
leaned O
over O
his O
table O
, O
boxing O
his O
papers O
about O
in O
a O
most O
indecorous O
manner O
, O
very O
sad O
to O
behold O
in O
an B-PER
elderly I-PER
man I-PER
like I-PER
him I-PER
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
as O
he O
was O
in O
many O
ways O
a B-PER
most I-PER
valuable I-PER
person I-PER
to I-PER
me I-PER
, O
and O
all O
the O
time O
before O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
meridian O
, O
was O
the B-PER
quickest I-PER
, I-PER
steadiest I-PER
creature I-PER
too O
, O
accomplishing O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
work O
in O
a O
style O
not O
easy O
to O
be O
matched O
-- O
for O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
overlook O
his O
eccentricities O
, O
though O
indeed O
, O
occasionally O
, O
I O
remonstrated O
with O
him O
. O
I O
did O
this O
very O
gently O
, O
however O
, O
because O
, O
though O
the B-PER
civilest I-PER
, I-PER
nay I-PER
, I-PER
the I-PER
blandest I-PER
and I-PER
most I-PER
reverential I-PER
of I-PER
men I-PER
in O
the O
morning O
, O
yet O
in O
the O
afternoon O
he O
was O
disposed O
, O
upon O
provocation O
, O
to O
be O
slightly O
rash O
with O
his O
tongue O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
insolent O
. O
Now O
, O
valuing O
his O
morning O
services O
as O
I O
did O
, O
and O
resolved O
not O
to O
lose O
them O
; O
yet O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
made O
uncomfortable O
by O
his O
inflamed O
ways O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
; O
and O
being O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
peace I-PER
, O
unwilling O
by O
my O
admonitions O
to O
call O
forth O
unseemly O
retorts O
from O
him O
; O
I O
took O
upon O
me O
, O
one O
Saturday O
noon O
( O
he O
was O
always O
worse O
on O
Saturdays O
) O
, O
to O
hint O
to O
him O
, O
very O
kindly O
, O
that O
perhaps O
now O
that O
he O
was O
growing O
old O
, O
it O
might O
be O
well O
to O
abridge O
his O
labors O
; O
in O
short O
, O
he O
need O
not O
come O
to O
my O
chambers O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
but O
, O
dinner O
over O
, O
had O
best O
go O
home B-FAC
to O
his B-FAC
lodgings I-FAC
and O
rest O
himself O
till O
teatime O
. O
But O
no O
; O
he O
insisted O
upon O
his O
afternoon O
devotions O
. O
His O
countenance O
became O
intolerably O
fervid O
, O
as O
he O
oratorically O
assured O
me O
-- O
gesticulating O
with O
a O
long O
ruler O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
-- O
that O
if O
his O
services O
in O
the O
morning O
were O
useful O
, O
how O
indispensable O
, O
then O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
? O
" O
With O
submission O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
" O
said O
Turkey B-PER
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
" O
I O
consider O
myself O
your B-PER
right-hand I-PER
man I-PER
. O
In O
the O
morning O
I O
but O
marshal O
and O
deploy O
my O
columns O
; O
but O
in O
the O
afternoon O
I O
put O
myself O
at O
their O
head O
, O
and O
gallantly O
charge O
the B-PER
foe I-PER
, O
thus O
! O
" O
-- O
and O
he O
made O
a O
violent O
thrust O
with O
the O
ruler O
. O
" O
But O
the O
blots O
, O
Turkey O
, O
" O
intimated O
I. O
" O
True O
, O
-- O
but O
, O
with O
submission O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
behold O
these O
hairs O
! O
I O
am O
getting O
old O
. O
Surely O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
a O
blot O
or O
two O
of O
a O
warm O
afternoon O
is O
not O
to O
be O
severely O
urged O
against O
gray O
hairs O
. O
Old O
age O
-- O
even O
if O
it O
blot O
the O
page O
-- O
is O
honorable O
. O
With O
submission O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
we O
_ O
both O
_ O
are O
getting O
old O
. O
" O
This O
appeal O
to O
my O
fellow-feeling O
was O
hardly O
to O
be O
resisted O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
go O
he O
would O
not O
. O
So O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
to O
let O
him O
stay O
, O
resolving O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
to O
see O
to O
it O
, O
that O
during O
the O
afternoon O
he O
had O
to O
do O
with O
my O
less O
important O
papers O
. O
Nippers B-PER
, O
the O
second O
on O
my O
list O
, O
was O
a B-PER
whiskered I-PER
, I-PER
sallow I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
, I-PER
upon I-PER
the I-PER
whole I-PER
, I-PER
rather I-PER
piratical-looking I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
about I-PER
five I-PER
and I-PER
twenty I-PER
. O
I O
always O
deemed O
him O
the O
victim O
of O
two O
evil O
powers O
-- O
ambition O
and O
indigestion O
. O
The O
ambition O
was O
evinced O
by O
a O
certain O
impatience O
of O
the O
duties O
of O
a B-PER
mere I-PER
copyist I-PER
, O
an O
unwarrantable O
usurpation O
of O
strictly O
professional O
affairs O
, O
such O
as O
the O
original O
drawing O
up O
of O
legal O
documents O
. O
The O
indigestion O
seemed O
betokened O
in O
an O
occasional O
nervous O
testiness O
and O
grinning O
irritability O
, O
causing O
the O
teeth O
to O
audibly O
grind O
together O
over O
mistakes O
committed O
in O
copying O
; O
unnecessary O
maledictions O
, O
hissed O
, O
rather O
than O
spoken O
, O
in O
the O
heat O
of O
business O
; O
and O
especially O
by O
a O
continual O
discontent O
with O
the O
height O
of O
the O
table O
where O
he O
worked O
. O
Though O
of O
a O
very O
ingenious O
mechanical O
turn O
, O
Nippers B-PER
could O
never O
get O
this O
table O
to O
suit O
him O
. O
He O
put O
chips O
under O
it O
, O
blocks O
of O
various O
sorts O
, O
bits O
of O
pasteboard O
, O
and O
at O
last O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
attempt O
an O
exquisite O
adjustment O
by O
final O
pieces O
of O
folded O
blotting O
paper O
. O
But O
no O
invention O
would O
answer O
. O
If O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
easing O
his O
back O
, O
he O
brought O
the O
table O
lid O
at O
a O
sharp O
angle O
well O
up O
towards O
his O
chin O
, O
and O
wrote O
there O
like O
a O
man O
using O
the O
steep O
roof O
of O
a B-FAC
Dutch I-FAC
house I-FAC
for O
his O
desk O
: O
-- O
then O
he O
declared O
that O
it O
stopped O
the O
circulation O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
If O
now O
he O
lowered O
the O
table O
to O
his O
waistbands O
, O
and O
stooped O
over O
it O
in O
writing O
, O
then O
there O
was O
a O
sore O
aching O
in O
his O
back O
. O
In O
short O
, O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
matter O
was O
, O
Nippers B-PER
knew O
not O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O
Or O
, O
if O
he O
wanted O
any O
thing O
, O
it O
was O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
a O
scrivener O
's O
table O
altogether O
. O
Among O
the O
manifestations O
of O
his O
diseased O
ambition O
was O
a O
fondness O
he O
had O
for O
receiving O
visits O
from O
certain O
ambiguous-looking O
fellows O
in O
seedy O
coats O
, O
whom O
he O
called O
his B-PER
clients I-PER
. O
Indeed O
I O
was O
aware O
that O
not O
only O
was O
he O
, O
at O
times O
, O
considerable O
of O
a B-PER
ward-politician I-PER
, O
but O
he O
occasionally O
did O
a O
little O
business O
at O
the B-PER
Justices I-PER
' O
courts O
, O
and O
was O
not O
unknown O
on O
the O
steps O
of O
the B-FAC
Tombs I-FAC
. O
I O
have O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
, O
however O
, O
that O
one O
individual O
who O
called O
upon O
him O
at O
my O
chambers O
, O
and O
who O
, O
with O
a O
grand O
air O
, O
he O
insisted O
was O
his B-PER
client I-PER
, O
was O
no O
other O
than O
a B-PER
dun I-PER
, O
and O
the O
alleged O
title-deed O
, O
a O
bill O
. O
But O
with O
all O
his O
failings O
, O
and O
the O
annoyances O
he O
caused O
me O
, O
Nippers B-PER
, O
like O
his B-PER
compatriot I-PER
Turkey B-PER
, O
was O
a B-PER
very I-PER
useful I-PER
man I-PER
to I-PER
me I-PER
; O
wrote O
a O
neat O
, O
swift O
hand O
; O
and O
, O
when O
he O
chose O
, O
was O
not O
deficient O
in O
a O
gentlemanly O
sort O
of O
deportment O
. O
Added O
to O
this O
, O
he O
always O
dressed O
in O
a O
gentlemanly O
sort O
of O
way O
; O
and O
so O
, O
incidentally O
, O
reflected O
credit O
upon O
my O
chambers O
. O
Whereas O
with O
respect O
to O
Turkey B-PER
, O
I O
had O
much O
ado O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
being O
a O
reproach O
to O
me O
. O
His O
clothes O
were O
apt O
to O
look O
oily O
and O
smell O
of O
eating-houses B-FAC
. O
He O
wore O
his O
pantaloons O
very O
loose O
and O
baggy O
in O
summer O
. O
His O
coats O
were O
execrable O
; O
his O
hat O
not O
to O
be O
handled O
. O
But O
while O
the O
hat O
was O
a O
thing O
of O
indifference O
to O
me O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
his O
natural O
civility O
and O
deference O
, O
as O
a B-PER
dependent I-PER
Englishman I-PER
, O
always O
led O
him O
to O
doff O
it O
the O
moment O
he O
entered O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
yet O
his O
coat O
was O
another O
matter O
. O
Concerning O
his O
coats O
, O
I O
reasoned O
with O
him O
; O
but O
with O
no O
effect O
. O
The O
truth O
was O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
that O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
so I-PER
small I-PER
an I-PER
income I-PER
, O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
sport O
such O
a O
lustrous O
face O
and O
a O
lustrous O
coat O
at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
time O
. O
As O
Nippers B-PER
once O
observed O
, O
Turkey B-PER
's O
money O
went O
chiefly O
for O
red O
ink O
. O
One O
winter O
day O
I O
presented O
Turkey B-PER
with O
a O
highly-respectable O
looking O
coat O
of O
my O
own O
, O
a O
padded O
gray O
coat O
, O
of O
a O
most O
comfortable O
warmth O
, O
and O
which O
buttoned O
straight O
up O
from O
the O
knee O
to O
the O
neck O
. O
I O
thought O
Turkey B-PER
would O
appreciate O
the O
favor O
, O
and O
abate O
his O
rashness O
and O
obstreperousness O
of O
afternoons O
. O
But O
no O
. O
I O
verily O
believe O
that O
buttoning O
himself O
up O
in O
so O
downy O
and O
blanket-like O
a O
coat O
had O
a O
pernicious O
effect O
upon O
him O
; O
upon O
the O
same O
principle O
that O
too O
much O
oats O
are O
bad O
for O
horses O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
precisely O
as O
a O
rash O
, O
restive O
horse O
is O
said O
to O
feel O
his O
oats O
, O
so O
Turkey B-PER
felt O
his O
coat O
. O
It O
made O
him O
insolent O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
man I-PER
whom I-PER
prosperity I-PER
harmed I-PER
. O
I O
A O
green O
and O
yellow O
parrot O
, O
which O
hung O
in O
a O
cage O
outside O
the O
door O
, O
kept O
repeating O
over O
and O
over O
: O
“ O
Allez O
vous-en O
! O
Allez O
vous-en O
! O
Sapristi O
! O
That O
's O
all O
right O
! O
” O
He O
could O
speak O
a O
little O
Spanish O
, O
and O
also O
a O
language O
which O
nobody B-PER
understood O
, O
unless O
it O
was O
the O
mocking-bird O
that O
hung O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
door O
, O
whistling O
his O
fluty O
notes O
out O
upon O
the O
breeze O
with O
maddening O
persistence O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
, O
unable O
to O
read O
his O
newspaper O
with O
any O
degree O
of O
comfort O
, O
arose O
with O
an O
expression O
and O
an O
exclamation O
of O
disgust O
. O
He O
walked O
down O
the B-FAC
gallery I-FAC
and O
across O
the O
narrow O
“ O
bridges O
” O
which O
connected O
the B-FAC
Lebrun I-FAC
cottages I-FAC
one O
with O
the O
other O
. O
He O
had O
been O
seated O
before O
the O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
main I-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
The O
parrot O
and O
the O
mockingbird O
were O
the O
property O
of O
Madame B-PER
Lebrun O
, O
and O
they O
had O
the O
right O
to O
make O
all O
the O
noise O
they O
wished O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
had O
the O
privilege O
of O
quitting O
their O
society O
when O
they O
ceased O
to O
be O
entertaining O
. O
He O
stopped O
before O
the O
door O
of O
his B-FAC
own I-FAC
cottage I-FAC
, O
which O
was O
the O
fourth O
one O
from O
the B-FAC
main I-FAC
building I-FAC
and O
next O
to O
the O
last O
. O
Seating O
himself O
in O
a O
wicker O
rocker O
which O
was O
there B-FAC
, O
he O
once O
more O
applied O
himself O
to O
the O
task O
of O
reading O
the O
newspaper O
. O
The O
day O
was O
Sunday O
; O
the O
paper O
was O
a O
day O
old O
. O
The O
Sunday O
papers O
had O
not O
yet O
reached O
Grand B-GPE
Isle I-GPE
. O
He O
was O
already O
acquainted O
with O
the O
market O
reports O
, O
and O
he O
glanced O
restlessly O
over O
the O
editorials O
and O
bits O
of O
news O
which O
he O
had O
not O
had O
time O
to O
read O
before O
quitting O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
the O
day O
before O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
wore O
eye-glasses O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
forty I-PER
, I-PER
of I-PER
medium I-PER
height I-PER
and I-PER
rather I-PER
slender I-PER
build I-PER
; O
he O
stooped O
a O
little O
. O
His O
hair O
was O
brown O
and O
straight O
, O
parted O
on O
one O
side O
. O
His O
beard O
was O
neatly O
and O
closely O
trimmed O
. O
Once O
in O
a O
while O
he O
withdrew O
his O
glance O
from O
the O
newspaper O
and O
looked O
about O
him O
. O
There O
was O
more O
noise O
than O
ever O
over O
at O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
main I-FAC
building I-FAC
was O
called O
“ O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
” O
to O
distinguish O
it O
from O
the B-FAC
cottages I-FAC
. O
The O
chattering O
and O
whistling O
birds O
were O
still O
at O
it O
. O
Two B-PER
young I-PER
girls I-PER
, I-PER
the I-PER
Farival I-PER
twins I-PER
, O
were O
playing O
a O
duet O
from O
“ O
Zampa O
” O
upon O
the O
piano O
. O
Madame B-PER
Lebrun O
was O
bustling O
in O
and O
out O
, O
giving O
orders O
in O
a O
high O
key O
to O
a B-PER
yard-boy I-PER
whenever O
she O
got O
inside O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
and O
directions O
in O
an O
equally O
high O
voice O
to O
a O
dining-room B-FAC
servant O
whenever O
she O
got O
outside O
. O
She O
was O
a B-PER
fresh I-PER
, I-PER
pretty I-PER
woman I-PER
, I-PER
clad I-PER
always I-PER
in I-PER
white I-PER
with I-PER
elbow I-PER
sleeves I-PER
. O
Her O
starched O
skirts O
crinkled O
as O
she O
came O
and O
went O
. O
Farther O
down O
, O
before O
one B-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
cottages I-FAC
, O
a B-PER
lady I-PER
in I-PER
black I-PER
was O
walking O
demurely O
up O
and O
down O
, O
telling O
her O
beads O
. O
A B-PER
good I-PER
many I-PER
persons I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
pension I-PER
had O
gone O
over O
to O
the B-GPE
Cheniere I-GPE
Caminada I-GPE
in O
Beaudelet B-VEH
's I-VEH
lugger I-VEH
to O
hear O
mass O
. O
Some B-PER
young I-PER
people I-PER
were O
out O
under O
the O
wateroaks O
playing O
croquet O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
's O
two O
children O
were O
there B-FAC
-- O
sturdy B-PER
little I-PER
fellows I-PER
of I-PER
four I-PER
and I-PER
five I-PER
. O
A B-PER
quadroon I-PER
nurse I-PER
followed O
them O
about O
with O
a O
faraway O
, O
meditative O
air O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
finally O
lit O
a O
cigar O
and O
began O
to O
smoke O
, O
letting O
the O
paper O
drag O
idly O
from O
his O
hand O
. O
He O
fixed O
his O
gaze O
upon O
a O
white O
sunshade O
that O
was O
advancing O
at O
snail O
's O
pace O
from O
the O
beach O
. O
He O
could O
see O
it O
plainly O
between O
the O
gaunt O
trunks O
of O
the O
water-oaks O
and O
across O
the O
stretch O
of O
yellow O
camomile O
. O
The B-LOC
gulf I-LOC
looked O
far O
away O
, O
melting O
hazily O
into O
the O
blue O
of O
the B-LOC
horizon I-LOC
. O
The O
sunshade O
continued O
to O
approach O
slowly O
. O
Beneath O
its O
pink-lined O
shelter O
were O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
, O
and O
young O
Robert B-PER
Lebrun I-PER
. O
When O
they O
reached O
the B-FAC
cottage I-FAC
, O
the B-PER
two I-PER
seated O
themselves O
with O
some O
appearance O
of O
fatigue O
upon O
the O
upper O
step O
of O
the O
porch O
, O
facing O
each O
other O
, O
each O
leaning O
against O
a O
supporting O
post O

“ O
What O
folly O
! O
to O
bathe O
at O
such O
an O
hour O
in O
such O
heat O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
. O
He O
himself O
had O
taken O
a O
plunge O
at O
daylight O
. O
That O
was O
why O
the O
morning O
seemed O
long O
to O
him O
. O
“ O
You O
are O
burnt O
beyond O
recognition O
, O
” O
he O
added O
, O
looking O
at O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
as O
one O
looks O
at O
a O
valuable O
piece O
of O
personal O
property O
which O
has O
suffered O
some O
damage O
. O
She O
held O
up O
her O
hands O
, O
strong O
, O
shapely O
hands O
, O
and O
surveyed O
them O
critically O
, O
drawing O
up O
her O
fawn O
sleeves O
above O
the O
wrists O
. O
Looking O
at O
them O
reminded O
her O
of O
her O
rings O
, O
which O
she O
had O
given O
to O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
before O
leaving O
for O
the B-LOC
beach I-LOC
. O
She O
silently O
reached O
out O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
, O
understanding O
, O
took O
the O
rings O
from O
his O
vest O
pocket O
and O
dropped O
them O
into O
her O
open O
palm O
. O
She O
slipped O
them O
upon O
her O
fingers O
; O
then O
clasping O
her O
knees O
, O
she O
looked O
across O
at O
Robert B-PER
and O
began O
to O
laugh O
. O
The O
rings O
sparkled O
upon O
her O
fingers O
. O
He O
sent O
back O
an O
answering O
smile O
. O
“ O
What O
is O
it O
? O
” O
asked O
Pontellier B-PER
, O
looking O
lazily O
and O
amused O
from O
one B-PER
to O
the B-PER
other I-PER
. O
It O
was O
some O
utter O
nonsense O
; O
some O
adventure O
out O
there B-LOC
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
they O
both O
tried O
to O
relate O
it O
at O
once O
. O
It O
did O
not O
seem O
half O
so O
amusing O
when O
told O
. O
They O
realized O
this O
, O
and O
so O
did O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
. O
He O
yawned O
and O
stretched O
himself O
. O
Then O
he O
got O
up O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
go O
over O
to O
Klein B-PER
's O
hotel O
and O
play O
a O
game O
of O
billiards O
. O
“ O
Come O
go O
along O
, O
Lebrun B-PER
, O
” O
he O
proposed O
to O
Robert B-PER
. O
But O
Robert B-PER
admitted O
quite O
frankly O
that O
he O
preferred O
to O
stay O
where O
he O
was O
and O
talk O
to O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
send O
him O
about O
his O
business O
when O
he O
bores O
you O
, O
Edna B-PER
, O
” O
instructed O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
as O
he O
prepared O
to O
leave O
. O
“ O
Here O
, O
take O
the O
umbrella O
, O
” O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
holding O
it O
out O
to O
him O
. O
He O
accepted O
the O
sunshade O
, O
and O
lifting O
it O
over O
his O
head O
descended O
the O
steps O
and O
walked O
away O
. O
“ O
Coming O
back O
to O
dinner O
? O
” O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
called O
after O
him O
. O
He O
halted O
a O
moment O
and O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
. O
He O
felt O
in O
his O
vest O
pocket O
; O
there O
was O
a O
ten-dollar O
bill O
there O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
; O
perhaps O
he O
would O
return O
for O
the O
early O
dinner O
and O
perhaps O
he O
would O
not O
. O
It O
all O
depended O
upon O
the O
company O
which O
he O
found O
over O
at O
Klein B-PER
's O
and O
the O
size O
of O
“ O
the O
game O
. O
” O
He O
did O
not O
say O
this O
, O
but O
she O
understood O
it O
, O
and O
laughed O
, O
nodding O
good-by O
to O
him O
. O
Both B-PER
children I-PER
wanted O
to O
follow O
their B-PER
father I-PER
when O
they O
saw O
him O
starting O
out O
. O
He O
kissed O
them O
and O
promised O
to O
bring O
them O
back O
bonbons O
and O
peanuts O
. O
II O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
's O
eyes O
were O
quick O
and O
bright O
; O
they O
were O
a O
yellowish O
brown O
, O
about O
the O
color O
of O
her O
hair O
. O
She O
had O
a O
way O
of O
turning O
them O
swiftly O
upon O
an O
object O
and O
holding O
them O
there O
as O
if O
lost O
in O
some O
inward O
maze O
of O
contemplation O
or O
thought O
. O
Her O
eyebrows O
were O
a O
shade O
darker O
than O
her O
hair O
. O
They O
were O
thick O
and O
almost O
horizontal O
, O
emphasizing O
the O
depth O
of O
her O
eyes O
. O
She O
was O
rather O
handsome O
than O
beautiful O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
captivating O
by O
reason O
of O
a O
certain O
frankness O
of O
expression O
and O
a O
contradictory O
subtle O
play O
of O
features O
. O
Her O
manner O
was O
engaging O
. O
Robert B-PER
rolled O
a O
cigarette O
. O
He O
smoked O
cigarettes O
because O
he O
could O
not O
afford O
cigars O
, O
he O
said O
. O
He O
had O
a O
cigar O
in O
his O
pocket O
which O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
had O
presented O
him O
with O
, O
and O
he O
was O
saving O
it O
for O
his O
after-dinner O
smoke O
. O
This O
seemed O
quite O
proper O
and O
natural O
on O
his O
part O
. O
In O
coloring O
he O
was O
not O
unlike O
his B-PER
companion I-PER
. O
A O
clean-shaved O
face O
made O
the O
resemblance O
more O
pronounced O
than O
it O
would O
otherwise O
have O
been O
. O
There O
rested O
no O
shadow O
of O
care O
upon O
his O
open O
countenance O
. O
His O
eyes O
gathered O
in O
and O
reflected O
the O
light O
and O
languor O
of O
the O
summer O
day O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
reached O
over O
for O
a O
palm-leaf O
fan O
that O
lay O
on O
the O
porch O
and O
began O
to O
fan O
herself O
, O
while O
Robert B-PER
sent O
between O
his O
lips O
light O
puffs O
from O
his O
cigarette O
. O
They O
chatted O
incessantly O
: O
about O
the O
things O
around O
them O
; O
their O
amusing O
adventure O
out O
in O
the O
water O
-- O
it O
had O
again O
assumed O
its O
entertaining O
aspect O
; O
about O
the O
wind O
, O
the O
trees O
, O
the O
people O
who O
had O
gone O
to O
the B-LOC
Cheniere I-LOC
; O
about O
the B-PER
children I-PER
playing I-PER
croquet I-PER
under I-PER
the I-PER
oaks I-PER
, O
and O
the B-PER
Farival I-PER
twins I-PER
, O
who O
were O
now O
performing O
the O
overture O
to O
“ O
The B-PER
Poet I-PER
and O
the B-PER
Peasant I-PER
. O
” O
Robert B-PER
talked O
a O
good O
deal O
about O
himself O
. O
He O
was O
very O
young O
, O
and O
did O
not O
know O
any O
better O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
talked O
a O
little O
about O
herself O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
. O
Each B-PER
was O
interested O
in O
what O
the B-PER
other I-PER
said O
. O
Robert B-PER
spoke O
of O
his O
intention O
to O
go O
to O
Mexico B-GPE
in O
the O
autumn O
, O
where B-GPE
fortune I-GPE
awaited I-GPE
him I-GPE
. O
He O
was O
always O
intending O
to O
go O
to O
Mexico B-FAC
, O
but O
some O
way O
never O
got O
there B-GPE
. O
Meanwhile O
he O
held O
on O
to O
his O
modest O
position O
in O
a O
mercantile O
house O
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
, O
where O
an O
equal O
familiarity O
with O
English O
, O
French O
and O
Spanish O
gave O
him O
no O
small O
value O
as O
a B-PER
clerk I-PER
and O
correspondent B-PER
. O
He O
was O
spending O
his O
summer O
vacation O
, O
as O
he O
always O
did O
, O
with O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
at O
Grand B-GPE
Isle I-GPE
. O
In O
former O
times O
, O
before O
Robert B-PER
could O
remember O
, O
“ O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
” O
had O
been O
a O
summer O
luxury O
of O
the B-PER
Lebruns I-PER
. O
Now O
, O
flanked O
by O
its O
dozen B-FAC
or I-FAC
more I-FAC
cottages I-FAC
, O
which O
were O
always O
filled O
with O
exclusive O
visitors O
from O
the B-LOC
“ I-LOC
Quartier I-LOC
Francais I-LOC
, I-LOC
” I-LOC
it O
enabled O
Madame B-PER
Lebrun O
to O
maintain O
the O
easy O
and O
comfortable O
existence O
which O
appeared O
to O
be O
her O
birthright O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
talked O
about O
her B-PER
father I-PER
's O
Mississippi B-GPE
plantation O
and O
her O
girlhood O
home O
in O
the B-LOC
old I-LOC
Kentucky I-LOC
bluegrass I-LOC
country I-LOC
. O
She O
was O
an B-PER
American I-PER
woman I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
small I-PER
infusion I-PER
of I-PER
French I-PER
which I-PER
seemed I-PER
to I-PER
have I-PER
been I-PER
lost I-PER
in I-PER
dilution I-PER
. O
She O
read O
a O
letter O
from O
her O
sister O
, O
who O
was O
away O
in O
the B-LOC
East I-LOC
, O
and O
who O
had O
engaged O
herself O
to O
be O
married O
. O
Robert B-PER
was O
interested O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
manner O
of O
girls B-PER
the B-PER
sisters I-PER
were O
, O
what O
the B-PER
father I-PER
was O
like O
, O
and O
how O
long O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
been O
dead O
. O
When O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
folded O
the O
letter O
it O
was O
time O
for O
her O
to O
dress O
for O
the O
early O
dinner O
. O
“ O
I O
see O
Leonce B-PER
is O
n't O
coming O
back O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
in O
the O
direction O
whence O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
had O
disappeared O
. O
Robert B-PER
supposed O
he O
was O
not O
, O
as O
there O
were O
a O
good O
many O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
club O
men O
over O
at O
Klein B-PER
's O
. O
When O
Mrs. B-PER
Pontellier O
left O
him O
to O
enter O
her B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
the B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
descended O
the O
steps O
and O
strolled O
over O
toward O
the B-PER
croquet I-PER
players I-PER
, O
where O
, O
during O
the O
half-hour O
before O
dinner O
, O
he O
amused O
himself O
with O
the B-PER
little I-PER
Pontellier I-PER
children I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
very I-PER
fond I-PER
of I-PER
him I-PER
. O
III O
It O
was O
eleven O
o'clock O
that O
night O
when O
Mr. B-PER
Pontellier O
returned O
from O
Klein B-PER
's O
hotel O
. O
He O
was O
in O
an O
excellent O
humor O
, O
in O
high O
spirits O
, O
and O
very O
talkative O
. O
His O
entrance O
awoke O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
who O
was O
in O
bed O
and O
fast O
asleep O
when O
he O
came O
in O
. O
He O
talked O
to O
her O
while O
he O
undressed O
, O
telling O
her O
anecdotes O
and O
bits O
of O
news O
and O
gossip O
that O
he O
had O
gathered O
during O
the O
day O
. O
From O
his O
trousers O
pockets O
he O
took O
a O
fistful O
of O
crumpled O
bank O
notes O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
silver O
coin O
, O
which O
he O
piled O
on O
the O
bureau O
indiscriminately O
with O
keys O
, O
knife O
, O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
whatever O
else O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
his O
pockets O
. O
She O
was O
overcome O
with O
sleep O
, O
and O
answered O
him O
with O
little O
half O
utterances O
. O
Chapter O
I O
My B-PER
father I-PER
's O
family O
name O
being O
Pirrip B-PER
, O
and O
my O
Christian O
name O
Philip B-PER
, O
my O
infant O
tongue O
could O
make O
of O
both O
names O
nothing O
longer O
or O
more O
explicit O
than O
Pip B-PER
. O
So O
, O
I O
called O
myself O
Pip B-PER
, O
and O
came O
to O
be O
called O
Pip B-PER
. O
I O
give O
Pirrip B-PER
as O
my B-PER
father I-PER
's O
family O
name O
, O
on O
the O
authority O
of O
his O
tombstone O

my B-PER
sister I-PER

-- O
Mrs. B-PER
Joe O
Gargery O
, O
who O
married O
the B-PER
blacksmith I-PER

As O
I O
never O
saw O
my B-PER
father I-PER
or O
my O
mother B-PER
, O
and O
never O
saw O
any O
likeness O
of O
either O
of O
them O
( O
for O
their O
days O
were O
long O
before O
the O
days O
of O
photographs O
) O
, O
my O
first O
fancies O
regarding O
what O
they O
were O
like O
were O
unreasonably O
derived O
from O
their O
tombstones O
. O
The O
shape O
of O
the O
letters O
on O
my B-PER
father I-PER
's O
, O
gave O
me O
an O
odd O
idea O
that O
he O
was O
a B-PER
square I-PER
, I-PER
stout I-PER
, I-PER
dark I-PER
man I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
curly I-PER
black I-PER
hair I-PER
. O
From O
the O
character O
and O
turn O
of O
the O
inscription O
, O
“ O
Also O
Georgiana B-PER
Wife O
of O
the B-PER
Above I-PER
, O
” O
I O
drew O
a O
childish O
conclusion O
that O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
freckled O
and O
sickly O
. O
To O
five O
little O
stone O
lozenges O
, O
each O
about O
a O
foot O
and O
a O
half O
long O
, O
which O
were O
arranged O
in O
a O
neat O
row O
beside O
their O
grave O
, O
and O
were O
sacred O
to O
the O
memory O
of O
five B-PER
little I-PER
brothers I-PER
of I-PER
mine I-PER
, O
-- O
who O
gave O
up O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
living O
, O
exceedingly O
early O
in O
that O
universal O
struggle O
, O
-- O
I O
am O
indebted O
for O
a O
belief O
I O
religiously O
entertained O
that O
they O
had O
all O
been O
born O
on O
their O
backs O
with O
their O
hands O
in O
their O
trousers-pockets O
, O
and O
had O
never O
taken O
them O
out O
in O
this O
state O
of O
existence O
. O
Ours O
was O
the B-LOC
marsh I-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
down O
by O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
within O
, O
as O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
wound O
, O
twenty O
miles O
of O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
. O
My O
first O
most O
vivid O
and O
broad O
impression O
of O
the O
identity O
of O
things O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
have O
been O
gained O
on O
a O
memorable O
raw O
afternoon O
towards O
evening O
. O
At O
such O
a O
time O
I O
found O
out O
for O
certain O
that O
this B-FAC
bleak I-FAC
place I-FAC
overgrown I-FAC
with I-FAC
nettles I-FAC
was O
the B-FAC

all I-PER

Pip B-PER

“ O
Hold O

“ O

said O
the B-PER

“ O
Pint O
out O

I O
pointed O
to O
where O
our B-GPE
village I-GPE
lay O
, O
on O
the B-LOC
flat I-LOC
in-shore I-LOC
among O
the O
alder-trees O

a O
mile O

The B-PER
man I-PER
, O
after O
looking O
at O
me O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
turned O
me O
upside O
down O
, O
and O
emptied O
my O
pockets O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
in O
them O
but O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
. O
When O
the B-FAC
church I-FAC
came O
to O
itself O
, O
-- O
for O
he O
was O
so O
sudden O
and O
strong O
that O
he O
made O
it O
go O
head O
over O
heels O
before O
me O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
steeple O
under O
my O
feet O
, O
-- O
when O
the B-FAC
church I-FAC
came O
to O
itself O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
was O
seated O
on O
a O
high O
tombstone O
, O
trembling O
while O
he O
ate O
the O
bread O
ravenously O
. O
“ O
You O
young B-PER
dog I-PER
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
man I-PER
, O
licking O
his O
lips O
, O
“ O
what O
fat O
cheeks O
you O
ha O
' O
got O

” O
I O
believe O
they O
were O
fat O
, O
though O
I O
was O
at O
that O
time O
undersized O
for O
my O
years O
, O
and O
not O
strong O
. O
“ O
Darn O
me O
if O
I O
could O
n't O
eat O

, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
man I-PER
, O
with O
a O
threatening O
shake O
of O
his O
head O
, O
“ O
and O
if O
I O
ha O

half O
a O

! O
” O
I O
earnestly O
expressed O
my O
hope O
that O
he O
would O
n't O
, O
and O
held O
tighter O
to O
the O
tombstone O
on O
which O
he O
had O
put O
me O
; O
partly O
, O
to O
keep O
myself O
upon O
it O
; O
partly O
, O
to O
keep O
myself O
from O
crying O
. O
“ O
Now O

” O
said O
the B-PER
man I-PER
. O
“ O
Where O

? O
” O
“ O
There O
, O
sir B-PER

” O
said O
I O
. O
He O
started O

made O
a O
short O
run O

stopped O
and O
looked O
over O
his O
shoulder O
. O
“ O
There O

I O
timidly O
explained O

“ O

“ O

“ O

“ O

“ O

” O
said O
he O
. O
And O
looked O
down O
at O
his O
leg O
. O
After O
darkly O
looking O
at O
his O
leg O
and O
me O
several O
times O
, O
he O
came O
closer O
to O
my O
tombstone O
, O
took O
me O
by O
both O
arms O
, O
and O
tilted O
me O
back O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
hold O
me O
; O
so O
that O
his O
eyes O
looked O
most O
powerfully O
down O
into O
mine O
, O
and O
mine O
looked O
most O
helplessly O
up O
into O
his O
. O
“ O
Now O
lookee O
here O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
the O
question O

whether O
you O

You O

“ O
And O
you O
know O
what O
wittles O
is O
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
sir B-PER

” O
After O
each O
question O
he O
tilted O
me O
over O
a O
little O
more O
, O
so O
as O
to O
give O
me O
a O
greater O
sense O
of O
helplessness O
and O
danger O
. O
“ O
You O

me O
a O

He O
tilted O
me O
again O

me O
again O

He O

me O
again O

“ O

have O
your O

out O

” O
He O
tilted O
me O
again O

I O
was O
dreadfully O
frightened O
, O
and O
so O
giddy O
that O
I O
clung O
to O
him O
with O
both O
hands O
, O

said O
, O
“ O
If O

perhaps O
I O

He O
gave O
me O
a O
most O
tremendous O
dip O

roll O
, O
so O
that O
the B-FAC
church I-FAC
jumped O
over O
its O
own O
weathercock O

Then O
, O
he O
held O
me O
by O
the O
arms O
, O
in O
an O
upright O
position O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stone O

went O
on O
in O
these O
fearful O
terms O

that B-PER

softly O

creep O
his O

him O

from O

off O

Now O

what O

” O
I O
said O

I O

I O
would O

him O

“ O
Say O
Lord B-PER
strike O
you O

you O

said O
the B-PER

I O
said O
so O

he O
took O
me O
down O

“ O
Now O

he O
pursued O
, O
“ O
you O

“ O
Goo-good O
night O

sir B-PER

I O
faltered O

“ O
Much O

glancing O
about O
him O
over O
the B-LOC

“ O
I O

I O
was O
a O
frog O

a O
eel O

” O
At O
the O

time O
, O
he O
hugged O
his O
shuddering O
body O
in O
both O
his O
arms O
, O
-- O
clasping O
himself O
, O
as O
if O
to O
hold O
himself O
together O
, O

and O
limped O
towards O
the O
low O
church B-FAC
wall O

As O
I O
saw O
him O
go O
, O
picking O
his O
way O
among O
the O
nettles O
, O
and O
among O
the O
brambles O
that O
bound O
the O
green O
mounds O
, O
he O
looked O
in O
my O
young O
eyes O
as O
if O
he O
were O
eluding O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
dead O
people O
, O
stretching O
up O
cautiously O
out O
of O
their O
graves O
, O
to O
get O
a O
twist O
upon O
his O
ankle O

pull O
him O
in O
. O
When O
he O
came O
to O
the O
low O
church B-FAC
wall O
, O
he O
got O
over O
it O
, O
like O
a B-PER
man I-PER
whose I-PER
legs I-PER
were I-PER
numbed I-PER
and I-PER
stiff I-PER
, O
and O
then O
turned O
round O
to O
look O
for O
me O

When O
I O
saw O
him O
turning O
, O
I O
set O
my O
face O
towards O
home B-FAC

and O
made O
the O
best O
use O
of O
my O
legs O

But O
presently O
I O
looked O
over O
my O
shoulder O
, O
and O
saw O
him O
going O
on O
again O
towards O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
still O
hugging O
himself O
in O
both O
arms O
, O
and O
picking O
his O
way O
with O
his O
sore O
feet O
among O
the O
great O
stones O
dropped O
into O
the B-LOC
marshes I-LOC
here O

there O

for O

Mary B-PER

with O
a O

of O

which O
might O

termed O
negative O
good-nature O

her O
virtues O

indeed O

were O
all O

She O
carefully O

She O
was O
educated O
with O
the O
expectation O

a O
large O
fortune O
, O
of O
course O
became O
a O
mere O
machine O

the O
homage O
of O
her B-PER
attendants I-PER
made O
a O
great O
part O

her O
puerile O
amusements O

and O
she O
never O
imagined O

any O

notions O

her O

by O
these O

were O
interwoven O

faintly I-PER

readily O

( O

While O

lived O
in O

seldom O

after O
eating O
an O

generally O
fell O
asleep O

infinitely O
more O
agreeable O
to O
his O

her O
sickly O

die-away O
languor O

Her O
voice O
was O
but O
the O
shadow O
of O
a O

she O
had O
, O
to O
complete O
her O
delicacy O

so O
relaxed O
her O
nerves O

that O
she O
became O
a O
mere O
nothing O

Many O
such O
noughts O
are O
there O
in O
the O
female O
world O

yet O
she O
had O
a O
good O
opinion O

her O

truly O
, O
she O
said O
long O
prayers O

sometimes O
read O
her O

she O
dreaded O
that O

whether O
her O

I O
can O
not O
pretend O

determine O
; O

what O

I O
have O
nothing O

be O
alone O

The O

Eliza B-PER

I O
would O
make O
it O

beg O
the B-PER

not O

besides O
another O

two O

shared O
her O

watched O

This O

not O
that O

pleasure O

a O

but O
it O
proceeded O
from O
vanity O

it O
gave O
her O
an O
opportunity O
of O
lisping O
out O
the O
prettiest O
French O
expressions O

ecstatic O
fondness O

in O
accents O
that O
had O
never O

She O
was O
chaste O

according O
to O
the O
vulgar O
acceptation O
of O
the O
word O

that O
is O

she O

any O

she O
feared O
the B-LOC

was O
indolent O

then O

to O
make O
amends O
for O
this O
seeming O
self-denial O
, O
she O
read O
all O
the O

on O
the O

had O
she O

her O

walk O

her B-PER

In O
due O
time O
she O
brought O
forth O
a B-PER
son I-PER

a B-PER
feeble I-PER
babe I-PER
; O
and O
the O
following O
year O
a B-PER
daughter I-PER

After O
the B-PER
mother I-PER

throes O
she O
felt O
very O
few O
sentiments O
of O
maternal O
tenderness O
: O
the B-PER
children I-PER
were O
given O
to O
nurses B-PER
, O
and O
she O
played O
with O
her O
dogs O

Want O
of O
exercise O
prevented O
the O
least O
chance O
of O
her O
recovering O
strength O
; O
and O
two O
or O
three O
milk-fevers O
brought O
on O
a O
consumption O
, O
to O
which O
her O
constitution O
tended O

Her B-PER
children I-PER
all O
died O
in O
their O
infancy O

except O
the O
two O
first O
, O
and O
she O
began O
to O
grow O
fond O
of O
the B-PER
son I-PER
, O
as O
he O
was O
remarkably O
handsome O
. O
For O
years O
she O
divided O
her O
time O
between O
the O
sofa O
, O
and O
the O
card-table O

She O
thought O
not O
of O
death O

though O
on O
the O
borders O
of O
the O
grave O

nor O
did O
any O
of O
the O
duties O
of O
her B-FAC
station I-FAC
occur O
to O
her O
as O
necessary O

Her B-PER
children I-PER
were O
left O
in O
the O
nursery O
; O
and O
when O
Mary B-PER
, O
the B-PER
little I-PER
blushing I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
appeared O
, O
she O
would O
send O
the B-PER
awkward I-PER
thing I-PER
away O
. O
To O
own O
the O
truth O
, O
she O
was O
awkward O
enough O
, O
in O
a B-FAC
house I-FAC
without O
any O
play-mates O
; O
for O
her B-PER
brother I-PER
had O
been O
sent O
to O
school B-FAC
, O
and O
she O
scarcely O
knew O
how O
to O
employ O
herself O
; O
she O
would O
ramble O
about O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
admire O
the O
flowers O
, O
and O
play O
with O
the O
dogs O
. O
An B-PER
old I-PER
house-keeper I-PER
told O
her O
stories O
, O
read O
to O
her O
, O
and O
, O
at O
last O
, O
taught O
her O
to O
read O
. O
Her B-PER
mother I-PER
talked O
of O
enquiring O
for O
a B-PER
governess I-PER
when O
her O
health O
would O
permit O
; O
and O
, O
in O
the O
interim O
desired O
her O
own B-PER
maid I-PER
to O
teach O
her O
French O
. O
As O
she O
had O
learned O
to O
read O
, O
she O
perused O
with O
avidity O
every O
book O
that O
came O
in O
her O
way O
. O
Neglected O
in O
every O
respect O
, O
and O
left O
to O
the O
operations O
of O
her O
own O
mind O
, O
she O
considered O
every O
thing O
that O
came O
under O
her O
inspection O
, O
and O
learned O
to O
think O
. O
She O
had O
heard O
of O
a O
separate O
state O
, O
and O
that O
angels B-PER
sometimes O
visited O
this B-LOC
earth I-LOC
. O
She O
would O
sit O
in O
a B-LOC
thick I-LOC
wood I-LOC
in O
the B-FAC
park I-FAC
, O
and O
talk O
to O
them O
; O
make O
little O
songs O
addressed O
to O
them O

and O
sing O
them O
to O
tunes O
of O
her O
own O
composing O
; O
and O
her O
native O
wood O
notes O
wild O
were O
sweet O
and O
touching O
. O
Her B-PER
father I-PER
always O
exclaimed O
against O
female O
acquirements O
, O
and O
was O
glad O
that O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
's O
indolence O
and O
ill O
health O
made O
her O
not O
trouble O
herself O
about O
them O

She O
had O
besides O
another O
reason O
, O
she O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
have O
a B-PER
fine I-PER
tall I-PER
girl I-PER
brought O
forward O
into O
notice O
as O
her B-PER
daughter I-PER
; O
she O
still O
expected O
to O
recover O
, O
and O
figure O
away O
in O
the O
gay O
world O
. O
Her B-PER
husband I-PER
was O
very O
tyrannical O
and O
passionate O
; O
indeed O
so O
very O
easily O
irritated O
when O
inebriated O
, O
that O
Mary B-PER
was O
continually O
in O
dread O
lest O
he O
should O
frighten O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
to O
death O
; O
her O
sickness O
called O
forth O
all O
Mary B-PER
's O
tenderness O
, O
and O
exercised O
her O
compassion O
so O
continually O
, O
that O
it O
became O
more O
than O
a O
match O
for O
self-love O
, O
and O
was O
the O
governing O
propensity O
of O
her O
heart O
through O
life O
. O
She O
was O
violent O
in O
her O
temper O
; O
but O
she O
saw O
her B-PER
father I-PER
's O
faults O
, O
and O
would O
weep O
when O
obliged O
to O
compare O
his O
temper O
with O
her O
own O
. O
-- O
She O
did O
more O
; O
artless O
prayers O
rose O
to O
Heaven B-LOC
for O
pardon O
, O
when O
she O
was O
conscious O
of O
having O
erred O
; O
and O
her O
contrition O
was O
so O
exceedingly O
painful O
, O
that O
she O
watched O
diligently O
the O
first O
movements O
of O
anger O
and O
impatience O
, O
to O
save O
herself O
this O
cruel O
remorse O

Sublime O
ideas O
filled O
her O
young O
mind O

always O
connected O
with O
devotional O
sentiments O
; O
extemporary O
effusions O
of O
gratitude O

and O
rhapsodies O
of O
praise O
would O
burst O
often O
from O
her O
, O
when O
she O
listened O
to O
the O
birds O

or O
pursued O
the O
deer O

She O
would O
gaze O
on O
the O

and O
ramble O
through O
the B-FAC
gloomy I-FAC
path I-FAC

observing O
the O
various O
shapes O
the O

assumed O

and O
listen O
to O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
that I-LOC
was I-LOC
not I-LOC
far I-LOC
distant I-LOC

The O
wandering O
spirits O

which O
she O
imagined O
inhabited O
every O
part O
of O
nature O

were O
her B-PER
constant I-PER
friends I-PER

confidants B-PER

She O
began O
to O
consider O
the B-PER
Great I-PER
First I-PER
Cause I-PER

formed O
just O
notions O

his O
attributes O

in O

dwelt O
on O
his O
wisdom O

Could O
she O
have O
loved O
her B-PER
father I-PER
or O
mother B-PER
, O
had O
they O
returned O
her O
affection O
, O
she O
would O
not O
so O
soon O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
sought O
out O
a B-LOC
new I-LOC
world I-LOC

Her O
sensibility O
prompted O
her O
to O
search O
for O
an O
object O
to O
love O
; O
on O
earth B-LOC
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
: O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
often O
disappointed O
her O
, O
and O
the O
apparent O
partiality O
she O
shewed O
to O
her B-PER
brother I-PER
gave O
her O
exquisite O
pain O
-- O
produced O
a O
kind O
of O
habitual O
melancholy O
, O
led O
her O
into O
a O
fondness O
for O
reading O
tales O
of O
woe O

and O
made O
her O
almost O
realize O
the O

THE O
TURN O
OF O
THE O
SCREW O
The O
story O
had O
held O
us O

round O
the O
fire O

sufficiently O
breathless O

except O
the O
obvious O
remark O
that O
it O
was O
gruesome O

as O
, O
on O
Christmas O
Eve O
in O
an B-FAC
old I-FAC
house I-FAC

a O
strange O
tale O
should O
essentially O
be O

I O
remember O
no O
comment O
uttered O

somebody B-PER
happened O
to O

that O
it O

the O

met O
in O
which O
such O
a O
visitation O
had O
fallen O
on O
a B-PER
child I-PER

The O
case O
, O
I O
may O
mention O
, O
was O
that O
of O
an O
apparition O
in O
just O
such O
an B-FAC
old I-FAC
house I-FAC
as O
had O
gathered O
us O
for O
the O
occasion O
-- O
an O
appearance O
, O
of O
a O
dreadful O
kind O
, O
to O
a O
little O
boy O
sleeping O
in O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
with O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
and O
waking O
her O
up O
in O
the O
terror O
of O
it O
; O
waking O
her O
not O
to O
dissipate O
his O
dread O
and O
soothe O
him O
to O
sleep O
again O
, O
but O
to O
encounter O
also O
, O
herself O
, O
before O
she O
had O
succeeded O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
same O
sight O
that O
had O
shaken O
him O

It O
was O
this O
observation O
that O
drew O
from O
Douglas B-PER
-- O
not O
immediately O
, O
but O
later O
in O
the O
evening O
-- O
a O
reply O
that O
had O
the O
interesting O
consequence O
to O
which O
I O
call O
attention O

Someone B-PER
else I-PER
told O
a O
story O
not O
particularly O
effective O
, O
which O
I O
saw O
he O
was O
not O
following O
. O
This O
I O
took O
for O
a O
sign O
that O
he O
had O
himself O
something O
to O
produce O
and O
that O
we O
should O
only O
have O
to O
wait O
. O
We O
waited O
in O
fact O
till O
two O
nights O
later O
; O
but O
that O
same O
evening O
, O
before O
we O
scattered O
, O
he O
brought O
out O
what O
was O
in O
his O
mind O

“ O
I O
quite O
agree O

that O
its O
appearing O
first O
to O
the B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
at O
so O
tender O
an O
age O
, O
adds O
a O
particular O
touch O
. O
But O
it O
’s O
not O
the O
first O
occurrence O
of O
its O
charming O
kind O
that O
I O
know O
to O
have O
involved O
a B-PER
child I-PER
. O
If O
the B-PER
child I-PER
gives O
the O
effect O
another O
turn O
of O
the O
screw O
, O
what O
do O
you O
say O
to O
TWO B-PER
children I-PER
-- O
? O
” O
“ O
We O
say O
, O
of O
course O
, O
” O
somebody B-PER
exclaimed O
, O
“ O
that O
they O
give O
two O
turns O
! O
Also O
that O
we O
want O
to O
hear O
about O
them O
. O
” O
I O
can O
see O
Douglas B-PER
there O
before O
the O
fire O
, O
to O
which O
he O
had O
got O
up O
to O
present O
his O
back O
, O
looking O
down O
at O
his B-PER
interlocutor I-PER
with O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets O
. O
“ O
Nobody B-PER
but O
me O
, O
till O
now O
, O
has O
ever O
heard O
. O
It O
’s O
quite O
too O
horrible O
. O
” O
This O
, O
naturally O
, O
was O
declared O
by O
several B-PER
voices I-PER
to O
give O
the O
thing O
the O
utmost O
price O
, O
and O
our B-PER
friend I-PER
, O
with O
quiet O
art O
, O
prepared O
his O
triumph O
by O
turning O
his O
eyes O
over O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
and O
going O
on O
: O
“ O
It O
’s O
beyond O
everything O
. O
Nothing O
at O
all O
that O
I O
know O
touches O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
For O
sheer O
terror O
? O
” O
I O
remember O
asking O
. O
He O
seemed O
to O
say O
it O
was O
not O
so O
simple O
as O
that O
; O
to O
be O
really O
at O
a O
loss O
how O
to O
qualify O
it O
. O
He O
passed O
his O
hand O
over O
his O
eyes O
, O
made O
a O
little O
wincing O
grimace O
. O
“ O
For O
dreadful O
-- O
dreadfulness O
! O
” O
“ O
Oh O
, O
how O
delicious O
! O
” O
cried O
one O
of O
the B-PER
women I-PER
. O
He O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
her O
; O
he O
looked O
at O
me O
, O
but O
as O
if O
, O
instead O
of O
me O
, O
he O
saw O
what O
he O
spoke O
of O
. O
“ O
For O
general O
uncanny O
ugliness O
and O
horror O
and O
pain O
. O
” O
“ O
Well O
then O
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
“ O
just O
sit O
right O
down O
and O
begin O
. O
” O
He O
turned O
round O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
gave O
a O
kick O
to O
a O
log O
, O
watched O
it O
an O
instant O
. O
Then O
as O
he O
faced O
us O
again O
: O
“ O
I O
ca O
n’t O
begin O
. O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
send O
to B-GPE
town I-GPE
. O
” O
There O
was O
a O
unanimous O
groan O
at O
this O
, O
and O
much O
reproach O
; O
after O
which O
, O
in O
his O
preoccupied O
way O
, O
he O
explained O
. O
“ O
The O
story O
’s O
written O
. O
It O
’s O
in O
a O
locked O
drawer O
-- O
it O
has O
not O
been O
out O
for O
years O
. O
I O
could O
write O
to O
my B-PER
man I-PER
and O
enclose O
the O
key O
; O
he O
could O
send O
down O
the O
packet O
as O
he O
finds O
it O
. O
” O
It O
was O
to O
me O
in O
particular O
that O
he O
appeared O
to O
propound O
this O
-- O
appeared O
almost O
to O
appeal O
for O
aid O
not O
to O
hesitate O
. O
He O
had O
broken O
a O
thickness O
of O
ice O
, O
the O
formation O
of O
many O
a O
winter O
; O
had O
had O
his O
reasons O
for O
a O
long O
silence O
. O
The O
others O
resented O
postponement O
, O
but O
it O
was O
just O
his O
scruples O
that O
charmed O
me O
. O
I O
adjured O
him O
to O
write O
by O
the O
first O
post O
and O
to O
agree O
with O
us O
for O
an O
early O
hearing O
; O
then O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
the O
experience O
in O
question O
had O
been O
his O
own O
. O
To O
this O
his O
answer O
was O
prompt O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
thank O
God B-PER
, O
no O
! O
” O
“ O
And O
is O
the O
record O
yours O
? O
You O
took O
the O
thing O
down O
? O
” O
“ O
Nothing O
but O
the O
impression O
. O
I O
took O
that O
HERE O
” O
-- O
he O
tapped O
his O
heart O
. O
“ O
I O
’ve O
never O
lost O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
Then O
your O
manuscript O
-- O
? O
” O
“ O
Is O
in O
old O
, O
faded O
ink O
, O
and O
in O
the O
most O
beautiful O
hand O
. O
” O
He O
hung O
fire O
again O
. O
“ O
A B-PER
woman I-PER
’s O
. O
She O
has O
been O
dead O
these O
twenty O
years O
. O
She O
sent O
me O
the O
pages O
in O
question O
before O
she O
died O
. O
” O
They O
were O
all O
listening O
now O
, O
and O
of O
course O
there O
was O
somebody B-PER
to O
be O
arch O
, O
or O
at O
any O
rate O
to O
draw O
the O
inference O
. O
But O
if O
he O
put O
the O
inference O
by O
without O
a O
smile O
it O
was O
also O
without O
irritation O
. O
“ O
She O
was O
a B-PER
most I-PER
charming I-PER
person I-PER
, O
but O
she O
was O
ten O
years O
older O
than O
I O
. O
She O
was O
my B-PER
sister I-PER
’s O
governess O
, O
” O
he O
quietly O
said O
. O
“ O
She O
was O
the B-PER
most I-PER
agreeable I-PER
woman I-PER
I I-PER
’ve I-PER
ever I-PER
known I-PER
in I-PER
her I-PER
position I-PER
; O
she O
would O
have O
been O
worthy O
of O
any O
whatever O
. O
It O
was O
long O
ago O
, O
and O
this O
episode O
was O
long O
before O
. O
I O
was O
at O
Trinity B-FAC
, O
and O
I O
found O
her O
at O
home B-FAC
on O
my O
coming O
down O
the O
second O
summer O
. O
I O
was O
much O
there O
that O
year O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
one O
; O
and O
we O
had O
, O
in O
her O
off-hours O
, O
some O
strolls O
and O
talks O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
-- O
talks O
in O
which O
she O
struck O
me O
as O
awfully O
clever O
and O
nice O
. O
Oh O
yes O
; O
do O
n’t O
grin O
: O
I O
liked O
her O
extremely O
and O
am O
glad O
to O
this O
day O
to O
think O
she O
liked O
me O
, O
too O
. O
If O
she O
had O
n’t O
she O
would O
n’t O
have O
told O
me O
. O
She O
had O
never O
told O
anyone B-PER
. O
It O
was O
n’t O
simply O
that O
she O
said O
so O
, O
but O
that O
I O
knew O
she O
had O
n’t O
. O
I O
was O
sure O
; O
I O
could O
see O
. O
You O
’ll O
easily O
judge O
why O
when O
you O
hear O
. O
” O
“ O
Because O
the O
thing O
had O
been O
such O
a O
scare O
? O
” O
He O
continued O
to O
fix O
me O
. O
“ O
You O
’ll O
easily O
judge O
, O
” O
he O
repeated O
: O
“ O
YOU O
will O
. O
” O
I O
fixed O
him O
, O
too O
. O
“ O
I O
see O
. O
She O
was O
in O
love O
. O
” O
He O
laughed O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
“ O
You O
ARE O
acute O
. O
Yes O
, O
she O
was O
in O
love O
. O
That O
is O
, O
she O
had O
been O
. O
That O
came O
out O
-- O
she O
could O
n’t O
tell O
her O
story O
without O
its O
coming O
out O
. O
I O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
she O
saw O
I O
saw O
it O
; O
but O
neither O
of O
us O
spoke O
of O
it O
. O
I O
remember O
the O
time O
and O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
-- O
the O
corner O
of O
the B-FAC
lawn I-FAC
, O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
great O
beeches O
and O
the O
long O
, O
hot O
summer O
afternoon O
. O
It O
was O
n’t O
a O
scene O
for O
a O
shudder O
; O
but O
oh O
-- O
! O
” O
He O
quitted O
the O
fire O
and O
dropped O
back O
into O
his O
chair O
. O
“ O
You O
’ll O
receive O
the O
packet O
Thursday O
morning O
? O
” O
I O
inquired O
. O
“ O
Probably O
not O
till O
the O
second O
post O
. O
” O
“ O
Well O
then O
; O
after O
dinner O
-- O
” O
“ O
You O
’ll O
all O
meet O
me O
here B-FAC
? O
” O
He O
looked O
us O
round O
again O
. O
“ O
Is O
n’t O
anybody B-PER
going O
? O
” O
It O
was O
almost O
the O
tone O
of O
hope O
. O
“ O
Everybody B-PER
will O
stay O
! O
” O
“ O
_ O
I O
_ O
will O
” O
-- O
and O
“ O
_ O
I O
_ O
will O
! O
” O
cried O
the B-PER
ladies I-PER
whose I-PER
departure I-PER
had I-PER
been I-PER
fixed I-PER
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Griffin O
, O
however O
, O
expressed O
the O
need O
for O
a O
little O
more O
light O
. O
“ O
Who O
was O
it O
she O
was O
in O
love O
with O
? O
” O
“ O
The O
story O
will O
tell O
, O
” O
I O
took O
upon O
myself O
to O
reply O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
I O
ca O
n’t O
wait O
for O
the O
story O
! O
” O
“ O
The O
story O
WO O
N’T O
tell O
, O
” O
said O
Douglas B-PER
; O
“ O
not O
in O
any O
literal O
, O
vulgar O
way O
. O
” O
“ O
More O
’s O
the O
pity O
, O
then O
. O
That O
’s O
the O
only O
way O
I O
ever O
understand O
. O
” O
“ O
Wo O
n’t O
YOU O
tell O
, O
Douglas O
? O
” O
somebody B-PER
else I-PER
inquired O
. O
He O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
again O
. O
“ O
Yes O
-- O
tomorrow O
. O
Now O
I O
must O
go O
to O
bed O
. O
Good O
night O
. O
” O
And O
quickly O
catching O
up O
a O
candlestick O
, O
he O
left O
us O
slightly O
bewildered O
. O
From O
our O
end O
of O
the B-FAC
great I-FAC
brown I-FAC
hall I-FAC
we O
heard O
his O
step O
on O
the O
stair O
; O
whereupon O
Mrs. B-PER
Griffin O
spoke O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
if O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
who O
she O
was O
in O
love O
with O
, O
I O
know O
who O
HE O
was O
. O
” O
“ O
She O
was O
ten O
years O
older O
, O
” O
said O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
. O
“ O
Raison O
de O
plus O
-- O
at O
that O
age O
! O
But O
it O
’s O
rather O
nice O
, O
his O
long O
reticence O
. O
” O
“ O
Forty O
years O
! O
” O
Griffin B-PER
put O
in O
. O
“ O
With O
this O
outbreak O
at O
last O
. O
” O
“ O
The O
outbreak O
, O
” O
I O
returned O
, O
“ O
will O
make O
a O
tremendous O
occasion O
of O
Thursday O
night O
; O
” O
and O
everyone B-PER
so O
agreed O
with O
me O
that O
, O
in O
the O
light O
of O
it O
, O
we O
lost O
all O
attention O
for O
everything O
else O
. O
The O
last O
story O
, O
however O
incomplete O
and O
like O
the O
mere O
opening O
of O
a O
serial O
, O
had O
been O
told O
; O
we O
handshook O
and O
“ O
candlestuck O
, O
” O
as O
somebody B-PER
said O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
. O
I O
knew O
the O
next O
day O
that O
a O
letter O
containing O
the O
key O
had O
, O
by O
the O
first O
post O
, O
gone O
off O
to O
his B-FAC
London I-FAC
apartments I-FAC
; O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
-- O
or O
perhaps O
just O
on O
account O
of O
-- O
the O
eventual O
diffusion O
of O
this O
knowledge O
we O
quite O
let O
him O
alone O
till O
after O
dinner O
, O
till O
such O
an O
hour O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
as O
might O
best O
accord O
with O
the O
kind O
of O
emotion O
on O
which O
our O
hopes O
were O
fixed O
. O
Then O
he O
became O
as O
communicative O
as O
we O
could O
desire O
and O
indeed O
gave O
us O
his O
best O
reason O
for O
being O
so O
. O
We O
had O
it O
from O
him O
again O
before O
the O
fire O
in O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
, O
as O
we O
had O
had O
our O
mild O
wonders O
of O
the O
previous O
night O
. O
It O
appeared O
that O
the O
narrative O
he O
had O
promised O
to O
read O
us O
really O
required O
for O
a O
proper O
intelligence O
a O
few O
words O
of O
prologue O
. O
Let O
me O
say O
here O
distinctly O
, O
to O
have O
done O
with O
it O
, O
that O
this O
narrative O
, O
from O
an O
exact O
transcript O
of O
my O
own O
made O
much O
later O
, O
is O
what O
I O
shall O
presently O
give O
. O
Poor O
Douglas B-PER
, O
before O
his O
death O
-- O
when O
it O
was O
in O
sight O
-- O
committed O
to O
me O
the O
manuscript O
that O
reached O
him O
on O
the O
third O
of O
these O
days O
and O
that O
, O
on O
the B-FAC
same I-FAC
spot I-FAC
, O
with O
immense O
effect O
, O
he O
began O
to O
read O
to O
our O
hushed O
little O
circle O
on O
the O
night O
of O
the O
fourth O
. O
The B-PER
departing I-PER
ladies I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
said I-PER
they I-PER
would I-PER
stay I-PER
did O
n’t O
, O
of O
course O
, O
thank O
heaven B-FAC
, O
stay O
: O
they O
departed O
, O
in O
consequence O
of O
arrangements O
made O
, O
in O
a O
rage O
of O
curiosity O
, O
as O
they O
professed O
, O
produced O
by O
the O
touches O
with O
which O
he O
had O
already O
worked O
us O
up O
. O
But O
that O
only O
made O
his O
little O
final O
auditory O
more O
compact O
and O
select O
, O
kept O
it O
, O
round O
the O
hearth O

subject O
to O
a O
common O

LETTER O
I O
LADY B-PER
HOWARD I-PER
TO O
THE B-PER
REV. I-PER
MR. B-PER
VILLARS O
Howard B-FAC
Grove I-FAC
, O
Kent B-GPE
. O
CAN O
any O
thing O
, O
my B-PER
good I-PER
Sir I-PER
, O
be O
more O
painful O
to O
a O
friendly O
mind O
, O
than O
a O
necessity O
of O
communicating O
disagreeable O
intelligence O
? O
Indeed O
it O
is O
sometimes O
difficult O
to O
determine O
, O
whether O
the B-PER
relator I-PER
or O
the B-PER
receiver I-PER
of I-PER
evil I-PER
tidings I-PER
is O
most O
to O
be O
pitied O
. O
I O
have O
just O
had O
a O
letter O
from O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
; O
she O
is O
totally O
at O
a O
loss O
in O
what O
manner O
to O
behave O
; O
she O
seems O
desirous O
to O
repair O
the O
wrongs O
she O
has O
done O
, O
yet O
wishes O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
to O
believe O
her O
blameless O
. O
She O
would O
fain O
cast O
upon O
another O
the O
odium O
of O
those O
misfortunes O
for O
which O
she O
alone O
is O
answerable O
. O
Her O
letter O
is O
violent O
, O
sometimes O
abusive O
, O
and O
that O
of O
you O
! O
- O
you O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
is O
under O
obligations O
which O
are O
greater O
even O
than O
her O
faults O
, O
but O
to O
whose O
advice O
she O
wickedly O
imputes O
all O
the O
sufferings O
of O
her B-PER
much I-PER
injured I-PER
daughter I-PER
, O
the B-PER
late I-PER
Lady I-PER
Belmont I-PER
. O
The O
chief O
purport O
of O
her O
writing O
I O
will O
acquaint O
you O
with O
; O
the O
letter O
itself O
is O
not O
worthy O
your O
notice O
. O
She O
tells O
me O
that O
she O
has O
, O
for O
many O
years O
past O
, O
been O
in O
continual O
expectation O
of O
making O
a O
journey O
to O

which O
prevented O
her O
writing O
for O
information O
concerning O
this O
melancholy O
subject O
, O
by O
giving O
her O
hopes O
of O
making O
personal O
inquiries O
; O
but O
family O
occurrences O
have O
still O
detained O
her O
in O
France B-GPE

which B-GPE
country I-GPE
she I-GPE
now I-GPE
sees I-GPE
no I-GPE
prospect I-GPE
of I-GPE
quitting I-GPE
. O
She O
has O
, O
therefore O
, O
lately O
used O
her O
utmost O
endeavors O
to O
obtain O
a O
faithful O
account O
of O
whatever O
related O
to O
her B-PER
ill-advised I-PER
daughter I-PER
; O
the O
result O
of O
which O
giving O
her O
some O
reason O
to O
apprehend O
, O
that O
, O
upon O
her O
death-bed O
, O
she O
bequeathed O
an B-PER
infant I-PER
orphan I-PER
to O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
she O
most O
graciously O
says O
, O
that O
if O
you O
, O
with O
whom O
she O
understands O
the B-PER
child I-PER
is O
placed O
, O
will O
procure O
authentic O
proofs O
of O
its O
relationship O
to O
her O
, O
you O
may O
sent O
it O
to O
Paris B-GPE
, I-GPE
where I-GPE
she I-GPE
will I-GPE
properly I-GPE
provide I-GPE
for I-GPE
it I-GPE
. O
This B-PER
woman I-PER
is O
, O
undoubtedly O
, O
at O
length O
, O
self-convicted O
of O
her O
most O
unnatural O
behaviour O
; O
it O
is O
evident O
, O
from O
her O
writing O
, O
that O
she O
is O
still O
as O
vulgar O
and O
illiterate O
as O
when O
her B-PER
first I-PER
husband I-PER
, O
Mr. B-PER
Evelyn O
, O
had O
the O
weakness O
to O
marry O
her O
; O
nor O
does O
she O
at O
all O
apologize O
for O
addressing O
herself O
to O
me O
, O
though O
I O
was O
only O
once O
in O
her O
company O
. O
Her O
letter O
has O
excited O
in O
my B-PER
daughter I-PER
Mirvan B-PER
, O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
be O
informed O
of O
the O
motives O
which O
induced O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
to O
abandon O
the O
unfortunate O
Lady B-PER
Belmont O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
a B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
protection O
was O
peculiarly O
necessary O
for O
her O
peace O
and O
her O
reputation O
. O
Notwithstanding O
I O
was O
personally O
acquainted O
with O
all B-PER
the I-PER
parties I-PER
concerned I-PER
in I-PER
that I-PER
affair I-PER
, O
the O
subject O
always O
appeared O
of O
too O
delicate O
a O
nature O
to O
be O
spoken O
of O
with O
the B-PER
principals I-PER
; O
I O
can O
not O
, O
therefore O
, O
satisfy O
Mrs. B-PER
Mirvan O
otherwise O
than O
by O
applying O
to O
you O
. O
By O
saying O
that O
you O
may O
send O
the B-PER
child I-PER

Madame B-PER
Duval O
aims O
at O
conferring O
, O
where O
she O
most O
owes O
obligation O

I O
pretend O

you O
advice O

you O

only I-PER
judge I-PER
of I-PER
what I-PER

I O
am O
much O
concerned O
at O
the O
trouble O

uneasiness O
which O
this B-PER

My B-PER

LETTER O
II O
MR. B-PER
VILLARS O
TO O
LADY B-PER
HOWARD I-PER
Berry B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
, O
Dorsetshire B-GPE
. O
YOUR B-PER
Ladyship I-PER
did O
but O
too O
well O
foresee O
the O
perplexity O
and O
uneasiness O
of O
which O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
's O
letter O
has O
been O
productive O
. O
However O
, O
I O
ought O
rather O
to O
be O
thankful O
that O
I O
have O
so O
many O
years O
remained O
unmolested O
, O
than O
repine O
at O
my O
present O
embarrassment O
; O
since O
it O
proves O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
this B-PER
wretched I-PER
woman I-PER
is O
at O
length O
awakened O
to O
remorse O
. O
In O
regard O
to O
my O
answer O
, O
I O
must O
humbly O
request O
your B-PER
Ladyship I-PER
to O
write O
to O
this O
effect O
: O
" O
That O
I O
would O
not O
, O
upon O
any O
account O
, O
intentionally O
offend O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
; O
but O
that O
I O
have O
weighty O
, O
nay O
unanswerable O
reasons O
for O
detaining O
her B-PER
grand-daughter I-PER
at O
present O
in O
England B-GPE
; O
the O
principal O
of O
which O
is O
, O
that O
it O
was O
the O
earnest O
desire O
of O
one O
to O
whose O
will O
she O
owes O
implicit O
duty O
. O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
may O
be O
assured O
, O
that O
she O
meets O
with O
the O
utmost O
attention O
and O
tenderness O
; O
that O
her O
education O
, O
however O
short O
of O
my O
wishes O
, O
almost O
exceeds O
my O
abilities O
; O
and O
I O
flatter O
myself O
, O
when O
the O
time O
arrives O
that O
she O
shall O
pay O
her O
duty O
to O
her B-PER
grand-mother I-PER
, O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
will O
find O
no O
reason O
to O
be O
dissatisfied O
with O
what O
has O
been O
done O
for O
her O
. O
" O
Your B-PER
Ladyship I-PER
will O
not O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
be O
surprised O
at O
this O
answer O
. O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
is O
by O
no O
means O
a O
proper O
companion O
or O
guardian O
for O
a B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
: O
she O
is O
at O
once O
uneducated O
and O
unprincipled O
; O
ungentle O
in O
temper O
, O
and O
unamiable O
in O
her O
manners O
. O
I O
have O
long O
known O
that O
she O
has O
persuaded O
herself O
to O
harbour O
an O
aversion O
for O
me-Unhappy B-PER
woman I-PER
! O
I O
can O
only O
regard O
her O
as O
an O
object O
of O
pity O
! O
I O
dare O
not O
hesitate O
at O
a O
request O
from O
Mrs. B-PER
Mirvan O
; O
yet O
, O
in O
complying O
with O
it O
, O
I O
shall O
, O
for O
her O
own O
sake O
, O
be O
as O
concise O
as O
I O
possibly O
can O
; O
since O
the O
cruel O
transactions O
which O
preceded O
the O
birth O
of O
my B-PER
ward I-PER
can O
afford O
no O
entertainment O
to O
a O
mind O
so O
humane O
as O
her O
's O
. O
Your B-PER
Ladyship I-PER
may O
probably O
have O
heard O
, O
that O
I O
had O
the O
honour O
to O
accompany O
Mr. B-PER
Evelyn O
, O
the O
grandfather O
of O
my B-PER
young I-PER
charge I-PER
, O
when O
upon O
his O
travels O
, O
in O
the O
capacity O
of O
a B-PER
tutor I-PER
. O
His O
unhappy O
marriage O
, O
immediately O
upon O
his O
return O
to O
England B-GPE
, O
with O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
, O
then O
a O
waiting-girl O
at O
a B-FAC
tavern I-FAC
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
advice O
and O
entreaties O
of O
all B-PER
his I-PER
friends I-PER
, O
among O
whom O
I O
was O
myself O
the O
most O
urgent O
, O
induced O
him O
to O
abandon O
his B-GPE
native I-GPE
land I-GPE
, O
and O
fix O
his O
abode O
in O
France B-GPE
. O
Thither O
he O
was O
followed O
by O
shame O
and O
repentance O
; O
feelings O
which O
his O
heart O
was O
not O
framed O
to O
support O
; O
for O
, O
notwithstanding O
he O
had O
been O
too O
weak O
to O
resist O
the O
allurements O
of O
beauty O
, O
which O
nature O
, O
though O
a O
niggard O
to O
her O
of O
every O
other O
boon O
, O
had O
with O
a O
lavish O
hand O
bestowed O
on O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
; O
yet O
he O
was O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
excellent I-PER
character I-PER
, O
and O
, O
till O
thus O
unaccountably O
infatuated O
, O
of O
unblemished O
conduct O
. O
He O
survived O
this O
ill-judged O
marriage O
but O
two O
years O
. O
Upon O
his O
death-bed O
, O
with O
an O
unsteady O
hand O
, O
he O
wrote O
me O
the O
following O
note O
: O
" O
My B-PER
friend I-PER
, O
forget O
your O
resentment O
, O
in O
favour O
of O
your O
humanity O
; O
- O
a B-PER
father I-PER
, O
trembling O
for O
the O
welfare O
of O
his B-PER
child I-PER
, O
bequeaths O
her O
to O
your O
care O

O O
Villars B-PER
! O
hear O
! O
pity O
! O
And O
relieve O
me O
! O
" O
Had O
my O
circumstances O
permitted O
me O
, O
I O
should O
have O
answered O
these O
words O
by O
an O
immediate O
journey O
to O
Paris B-GPE
; O
but O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
act O
by O
the O
agency O
of O
a B-PER
friend I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
upon I-PER
the I-PER
spot I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
present I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
opening I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
will I-PER
. O
Mr. B-PER
Evelyn O
left O
to O
me O
a O
legacy O
of O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
and O
the O
sole O
guardianship O
of O
his B-PER
daughter I-PER
's I-PER
person I-PER
till O
her O
eighteenth O
year O
; O
conjuring O
me O
, O
in O
the O
most O
affecting O
terms O
, O
to O
take O
the O
charge O
of O
her O
education O
till O
she O
was O
able O
to O
act O
with O
propriety O
for O
herself O
; O
but O
, O
in O
regard O
to O
fortune O
, O
he O
left O
her O
wholly O
dependent O
on O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
to O
whose O
tenderness O
he O
earnestly O
recommended O
her O
. O
Thus O
, O
though O
he O
would O
not O
, O
to O
a O
woman O
low-bred O
and O
illiberal O
as O
Mrs. B-PER
Evelyn O
, O
trust O
the O
conduct O
and O
morals O
of O
his B-PER
daughter I-PER
, O
he O
nevertheless O
thought O
proper O
to O
secure O
to O
her O
the O
respect O
and O
duty O
to O
which O
, O
from O
her B-PER
own I-PER
child I-PER
, O
were O
certainly O
her O
due O
; O
but O
unhappily O
, O
it O
never O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
the B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
on O
her O
part O
, O
could O
fail O
in O
affection O
or O
justice O
. O
Miss B-PER
Evelyn O
, O
Madam B-PER
, O
from O
the O
second O
to O
the O
eighteenth O
year O
of O
her O
life O
, O
was O
brought O
up O
under O
my O
care O
, O
and O
, O
except O
when O
at O
school O
under O
my O
roof O
. O
I O
need O
not O
speak O
to O
your B-PER
Ladyship I-PER
of O
the O
virtues O
of O
that B-PER
excellent I-PER
young I-PER
creature I-PER
. O
She O
loved O
me O
as O
her B-PER
father I-PER
; O
nor O
was O
Mrs. B-PER
Villars O
less O
valued O
by O
her O
; O
while O
to O
me O
she O
became O
so O
dear O
, O
that O
her O
loss O
was O
little O
less O
afflicting O
than O
that O
which O
I O
have O
since O
sustained O
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Villars O
herself O
. O
At O
that O
period O
of O
her O
life O
we O
parted O
; O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
then O
married O
to O
Monsieur B-PER
Duval O
, O
sent O
for O
her O
to O
Paris B-GPE
. O
How O
often O
have O
I O
since O
regretted O
that O
I O
did O
not O
accompany O
her O
thither O
! O
Protected O
and O
supported O
by O
me O
, O
the O
misery O
and O
disgrace O
which O
awaited O
her O
might O
perhaps O
have O
been O
avoided O
. O
But O
, O
to O
be O
brief-Madame B-PER
Duval O
, O
at O
the O
instigation O
of O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
, O
earnestly O
, O
or O
rather O
tyrannically O
, O
endeavoured O
to O
effect O
a O
union O
between O
Miss B-PER
Evelyn O
and O
one O
of O
his B-PER
nephews I-PER
. O
And O
, O
when O
she O
found O
her O
power O
inadequate O
to O
her O
attempt O
, O
enraged O
at O
her O
non-compliance O
, O
she O
treated O
her O
with O
the O
grossest O
unkindness O
, O
and O
threatened O
her O
with O
poverty O
and O
ruin O
. O
Miss B-PER
Evelyn O
, O
to O
whom O
wrath O
and O
violence O
had O
hitherto O
been O
strangers O
, O
soon O
grew O
weary O
of O
such O
usage O
; O
and O
rashly O
, O
and O
without O
a B-PER
witness I-PER
, O
consented O
to O
a O
private O
marriage O
with O
Sir B-PER
John O
Belmont O
, O
a B-PER
very I-PER
profligate I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, O
who O
had O
but O
too O
successfully O
found O
means O
to O
insinuate O
himself O
into O
her O
favour O
. O
He O
promised O
to O
conduct O
her O
to O
England-he B-GPE
did.-O O
, O
Madam B-PER
, O
you O
know O
the O
rest O
! O
- O
Disappointed O
of O
the O
fortune O
he O
expected O
, O
by O
the O
inexorable O
rancour O
of O
the B-PER
Duvals I-PER
, O
he O
infamously O
burnt O
the O
certificate O
of O
their O
marriage O
, O
and O
denied O
that O
they O
had O
ever O
been O
united O
. O
She O
flew O
to O
me O
for O
protection O
. O
With O
what O
mixed O
transports O
of O
joy O
and O
anguish O
did O
I O
again O
see O
her O
! O
By O
my O
advice O
, O
she O
endeavoured O
to O
procure O
proofs O
of O
her O
marriage-but O
in O
vain O
; O
her O
credulity O
had O
been O
no O
match O
for O
his O
art O
. O
Every B-PER
body I-PER
believed O
her O
innocent O
, O
from O
the O
guiltless O
tenor O
of O
her O
unspotted O
youth O
, O
and O
from O
the O
known O
libertinism O
of O
her B-PER
barbarous I-PER
betrayer I-PER
. O
Yet O
her O
sufferings O
were O
too O
acute O
for O
her O
slender O
frame O
; O
and O
the O
same O
moment O
that O
gave O
birth O
to O
her B-PER
infant I-PER
, O
put O
an O
end O
at O
once O
to O
the O
sorrows O
and O
the O
life O
of O
its B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
The O
rage O
of O
Madame B-PER
Duval O
at O
her O
elopement O
, O
abated O
not O
while O
this B-PER
injured I-PER
victim I-PER
of I-PER
cruelty I-PER

drew O
breath O
. O
She O
probably O
intended O
, O
in O
time O
, O
to O
have O
pardoned O
her O
; O
but O
time O
was O
not O
allowed O
. O
When O
she O
was O
informed O
of O
her O
death O

I O
have O
been O
told O
, O
that O
the O
agonies O
of O
grief O

remorse O
, O
with O
which O
she O
was O
seized O

occasioned O
her O
a O
severe O

Mrs B-PER
Marjoribanks O
, O
poor B-PER
lady I-PER
, O
had O
been O
an B-PER
invalid I-PER
for O
many O
years O
; O
she O
had O
grown O
a O
little O
peevish O
in O
her O
loneliness O
, O
not O
feeling O
herself O
of O
much O
account O
in O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
There O
are O
some B-PER
rare I-PER
natures I-PER
that I-PER
are I-PER
content I-PER
to I-PER
acquiesce I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
general I-PER
neglect I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
forget I-PER
themselves I-PER
when I-PER
they I-PER
find I-PER
themselves I-PER
forgotten I-PER
; O
but O
it O
is O
unfortunately O
much O
more O
usual O
to O
take O
the O
plan O
adopted O
by O
Mrs B-PER
Marjoribanks O
, O
who O
devoted O
all O
her O
powers O
, O
during O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
of O
her O
life O
, O
to O
the O
solacement O
and O
care O
of O
that O
poor O
self O
which O
other B-PER
people I-PER
neglected O
. O
The O
consequence O
was O
, O
that O
when O
she O
disappeared O
from O
her O
sofa O
-- O
except O
for O
the O
mere O
physical O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
there O
-- O
no B-PER
one I-PER
, O
except O
her B-PER
maid I-PER
, I-PER
whose I-PER
occupation I-PER
was I-PER
gone I-PER
, O
could O
have O
found O
out O
much O
difference O
. O
Her B-PER
husband I-PER
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
who O
had O
, O
somewhere O
, O
hidden O
deep O
in O
some O
secret O
corner O
of O
his O
physical O
organisation O
, O
the O
remains O
of O
a O
heart O
, O
experienced O
a O
certain O
sentiment O
of O
sadness O
when O
he O
re-entered O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
from I-FAC
which I-FAC
she I-FAC
had I-FAC
gone I-FAC
away I-FAC
for I-FAC
ever I-FAC
. O
But O
Dr B-PER
Marjoribanks O
was O
too O
busy O
a B-PER
man I-PER
to O
waste O
his O
feelings O
on O
a O
mere O
sentiment O
. O
His B-PER
daughter I-PER
, O
however O
, O
was O
only O
fifteen O
, O
and O
had O
floods O
of O
tears O
at O
her O
command O
, O
as O
was O
natural O
at O
that O
age O
. O
All O
the O
way O
home B-FAC
she O
revolved O
the O
situation O
in O
her O
mind O
, O
which O
was O
considerably O
enlightened O
by O
novels O
and O
popular O
philosophy O
-- O
for O
the B-PER
lady I-PER
at O
the O
head O
of O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
school O
was O
a B-PER
devoted I-PER
admirer I-PER
of I-PER
_ I-PER
Friends I-PER
in I-PER
Council I-PER
_ I-PER
, O
and O
was O
fond O
of O
bestowing O
that O
work O
as O
a O
prize O
, O
with O
pencil-marks O
on O
the O
margin O
-- O
so O
that O
Lucilla B-PER
's O
mind O
had O
been O
cultivated O
, O
and O
was O
brimful O
of O
the O
best O
of O
sentiments O
. O
She O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
on O
her O
journey O
to O
a O
great O
many O
virtuous O
resolutions O
; O
for O
, O
in O
such O
a O
case O
as O
hers O
, O
it O
was O
evidently O
the O
duty O
of O
an B-PER
only I-PER
child I-PER
to O
devote O
herself O
to O
her B-PER
father I-PER
's O
comfort O
, O
and O
become O
the O
sunshine O
of O
his O
life O
, O
as O
so B-PER
many I-PER
young I-PER
persons I-PER
of I-PER
her I-PER
age I-PER
have O
been O
known O
to O
become O
in O
literature O
. O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
had O
a O
lively O
mind O
, O
and O
was O
capable O
of O
grasping O
all O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
situation O
at O
a O
glance O
. O
Thus O
, O
between O
the O
outbreaks O
of O
her O
tears O
for O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
it O
became O
apparent O
to O
her O
that O
she O
must O
sacrifice O
her O
own O
feelings O
, O
and O
make O
a B-FAC
cheerful I-FAC
home I-FAC
for O
papa B-PER
, O
and O
that O
a O
great O
many O
changes O
would O
be O
necessary O
in O
the O
household O
-- O
changes O
which O
went O
so O
far O
as O
even O
to O
extend O
to O
the O
furniture O
. O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
sketched O
to O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
lay O
back O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the B-VEH
railway I-VEH
carriage I-VEH
, O
with O
her O
veil O
down O
, O
how O
she O
would O
wind O
herself O
up O
to O
the O
duty O
of O
presiding O
at O
her B-PER
papa I-PER
's O
dinner-parties O
, O
and O
charming O
everybody B-PER
by O
her O
good O
humour O
, O
and O
brightness O
, O
and O
devotion O
to O
his O
comfort O
; O
and O
how O
, O
when O
it O
was O
all O
over O
, O
she O
would O
withdraw O
and O
cry O
her O
eyes O
out O
in O
her B-FAC
own I-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
and O
be O
found O
in O
the O
morning O
languid O
and O
worn-out O
, O
but O
always O
heroical O
, O
ready O
to O
go O
downstairs B-FAC
and O
assist O
at O
dear B-PER
papa I-PER
's O
breakfast O
, O
and O
keep O
up O
her O
smiles O
for O
him O
till O
he O
had O
gone O
out O
to O
his B-PER
patients I-PER
. O
Altogether O
the O
picture O
was O
a O
very O
pretty O
one O
; O
and O
, O
considering O
that O
a B-PER
great I-PER
many I-PER
young I-PER
ladies I-PER
in I-PER
deep I-PER
mourning I-PER
put O
force O
upon O
their O
feelings O
in O
novels O
, O
and O
maintain O
a O
smile O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the B-PER
unobservant I-PER
male I-PER
creatures I-PER
of I-PER
whom I-PER
they I-PER
have I-PER
the I-PER
charge I-PER
, O
the O
idea O
was O
not O
at O
all O
extravagant O
, O
considering O
that O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
was O
but O
fifteen O
. O
She O
was O
not O
, O
however O
, O
exactly O
the O
kind O
of O
figure O
for O
this O
_ O
mise O
en O
scène O
_ O
. O
When O
her B-PER
schoolfellows I-PER
talked O
of O
her O
to O
their B-PER
friends I-PER
-- O
for O
Lucilla B-PER
was O
already O
an B-PER
important I-PER
personage I-PER
at O
Mount O
Pleasant O
-- O
the O
most O
common O
description O
they O
gave O
her O
was O
, O
that O
she O
was O
" B-PER
a I-PER
large I-PER
girl I-PER
" I-PER
; O
and O
there O
was O
great O
truth O
in O
the O
adjective O
. O
She O
was O
not O
to O
be O
described O
as O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
girl I-PER
-- O
which O
conveys O
an O
altogether O
different O
idea O
-- O
but O
she O
was O
large O
in O
all O
particulars O
, O
full O
and O
well-developed O
, O
with O
somewhat O
large O
features O
, O
not O
at O
all O
pretty O
as O
yet O
, O
though O
it O
was O
known O
in O
Mount B-GPE
Pleasant I-GPE
that O
somebody B-PER
had O
said O
that O
such O
a O
face O
might O
ripen O
into O
beauty O
, O
and O
become O
" O
grandiose O
, O
" O
for O
anything O
anybody B-PER
could O
tell O
. O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
was O
not O
vain O
; O
but O
the O
word O
had O
taken O
possession O
of O
her O
imagination O
, O
as O
was O
natural O
, O
and O
solaced O
her O
much O
when O
she O
made O
the O
painful O
discovery O
that O
her O
gloves O
were O
half O
a O
number O
larger O
, O
and O
her O
shoes O
a O
hair-breadth O
broader O
, O
than O
those O
of O
any O
of O
her B-PER
companions I-PER
; O
but O
the O
hands O
and O
feet O
were O
both O
perfectly O
well O
shaped O
; O
and O
being O
at O
the O
same O
time O
well O
clothed O
and O
plump O
, O
were O
much O
more O
presentable O
and O
pleasant O
to O
look O
upon O
than O
the O
lean O
rudimentary O
schoolgirl B-PER
hands O
with O
which O
they O
were O
surrounded O
. O
To O
add O
to O
these O
excellences O
, O
Lucilla B-PER
had O
a O
mass O
of O
hair O
which O
, O
if O
it O
could O
but O
have O
been O
cleared O
a O
little O
in O
its O
tint O
, O
would O
have O
been O
golden O
, O
though O
at O
present O
it O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
tawny O
, O
and O
curly O
to O
exasperation O
. O
She O
wore O
it O
in O
large O
thick O
curls O
, O
which O
did O
not O
, O
however O
, O
float O
or O
wave O
, O
or O
do O
any O
of O
the O
graceful O
things O
which O
curls O
ought O
to O
do O
; O
for O
it O
had O
this O
aggravating O
quality O
, O
that O
it O
would O
not O
grow O
long O
, O
but O
would O
grow O
ridiculously O
, O
unmanageably O
thick O
, O
to O
the O
admiration O
of O
her B-PER
companions I-PER
, O
but O
to O
her O
own O
despair O
, O
for O
there O
was O
no O
knowing O
what O
to O
do O
with O
those O
short O
but O
ponderous O
locks O
. O
These O
were O
the O
external O
characteristics O
of O
the O
girl O
who O
was O
going O
home B-FAC
to O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
her B-PER
widowed I-PER
father I-PER
, O
and O
meant O
to O
sacrifice O
herself O
to O
his O
happiness O
. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
her O
rapid O
journey O
she O
had O
already O
settled O
upon O
everything O
that O
had O
to O
be O
done O
; O
or O
rather O
, O
to O
speak O
truly O
, O
had O
rehearsed O
everything O
, O
according O
to O
the O
habit O
already O
acquired O
by O
a O
quick O
mind O
, O
a O
good O
deal O
occupied O
with O
itself O
. O
First O
, O
she O
meant O
to O
fall O
into O
her B-PER
father I-PER
's O
arms O
-- O
forgetting O
, O
with O
that O
singular O
facility O
for O
overlooking O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
others O
which O
belongs O
to O
such O
a O
character O
, O
that O
Dr B-PER
Marjoribanks O
was O
very O
little O
given O
to O
embracing O
, O
and O
that O
a O
hasty O
kiss O
on O
her O
forehead O
was O
the O
warmest O
caress O
he O
had O
ever O
given O
his B-PER
daughter I-PER
-- O
and O
then O
to O
rush O
up O
to O
the B-FAC
chamber I-FAC
of I-FAC
death I-FAC
and O
weep O
over O
dear B-PER
mamma I-PER
. O
" O
And O
to O
think O
I O
was O
not O
there B-FAC
to O
soothe O
her O
last O
moments O
! O
" O
Lucilla B-PER
said O
to O
herself O
, O
with O
a O
sob O
, O
and O
with O
feelings O
sufficiently O
real O
in O
their O
way O
. O
After O
this O
, O
the B-PER
devoted I-PER
daughter I-PER
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
come O
downstairs B-FAC
again O
, O
pale O
as O
death O
, O
but O
self-controlled O
, O
and O
devote O
herself O
to O
papa B-PER
. O
Perhaps O
, O
if O
great O
emotion O
should O
make O
him O
tearless O
, O
as O
such O
cases O
had O
been O
known O
, O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
would O
steal O
into O
his O
arms O
unawares O
, O
and O
so O
surprise O
him O
into O
weeping O
. O
All O
this O
went O
briskly O
through O
her O
mind O
, O
undeterred O
by O
the O
reflection O
that O
tears O
were O
as O
much O
out O
of O
the B-PER
Doctor I-PER
's O
way O
as O
embraces O
; O
and O
in O
this O
mood O
she O
sped O
swiftly O
along O
in O
the O
inspiration O
of O
her O
first O
sorrow O
, O
as O
she O
imagined O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
to O
suffer O
her O
first O
disappointment O
, O
which O
was O
of O
a O
less O
soothing O
character O
than O
that O
mild O
and O
manageable O
grief O
. O
When O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
reached O
home B-FAC
her B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
been O
dead O
for O
twenty-four O
hours O
; O
and O
her B-PER
father I-PER
was O
not O
at O
the O
door O
to O
receive O
her O
as O
she O
had O
expected O
, O
but O
by O
the O
bedside O
of O
a B-PER
patient I-PER
in I-PER
extremity I-PER
, O
who O
could O
not O
consent O
to O
go O
out O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
without O
the B-PER
Doctor I-PER
. O
This O
was O
a O
sad O
reversal O
of O
her O
intentions O
, O
but O
Lucilla B-PER
was O
not O
the B-PER
woman I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
disconcerted I-PER
. O
She O
carried O
out O
the O
second O
part O
of O
her O
programme O
without O
either O
interference O
or O
sympathy O
, O
except O
from O
Mrs B-PER
Marjoribanks O
's O
maid O
, O
who O
had O
some O
hopes O
from O
the O
moment O
of O
her O
arrival O
. O
" O
I O
ca O
n't O
abear O
to O
think O
as O
I O
'm O
to O
be O
parted O
from O
you O
all O
, O
miss B-PER
, O
" O
sobbed O
the B-PER
faithful I-PER
attendant I-PER
. O
" O
I O
've O
lost O
the B-PER
best I-PER
missus I-PER
as O
ever O
was O
, O
and O
I O
should O
n't O
mind O
going O
after O
her O
. O
Whenever O
any B-PER
one I-PER
gets O
a B-PER
good I-PER
friend I-PER
in O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
they O
're O
the O
first O
to O
be O
took O
away O
, O
" O
said O
the B-PER
weeping I-PER
handmaiden I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
naturally I-PER
saw I-PER
her I-PER
own I-PER
loss I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
most I-PER
vivid I-PER
light I-PER
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
Ellis B-PER
, O
" O
cried O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
, O
reposing O
her O
sorrow O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
this B-PER
anxious I-PER
attendant I-PER
, O
" O
we O
must O
try O
to O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
poor B-PER
papa I-PER
! O
" O
With O
this O
end O
Lucilla B-PER
made O
herself O
very O
troublesome O
to O
the B-PER
sober-minded I-PER
Doctor I-PER
during O
those O
few O
dim O
days O
before O
the O
faint O
and O
daily O
lessening O
shadow O
of O
poor O
Mrs B-PER
Marjoribanks O
was O
removed O
altogether O
from O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
When O
that O
sad O
ceremony O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
the B-PER
Doctor I-PER
returned O
, O
serious O
enough O
, O
Heaven O
knows O
, O
to O
the O
great O
house O
, O
where O
the O
faded O
helpless O
woman O
, O
who O
had O
notwithstanding O
been O
his B-PER
love I-PER
and O
his B-PER
bride I-PER
in O
other O
days O
, O
lay O
no O
longer O
on O
the O
familiar O
sofa O
, O
the O
crisis O
arrived O
which O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
had O
rehearsed O
so O
often O
, O
but O
after O
quite O
a O
different O
fashion O
. O
The B-PER
widower I-PER
was O
tearless O
, O
indeed O
, O
but O
not O
from O
excess O
of O
emotion O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
a O
painful O
heaviness O
possessed O
him O
when O
he O
became O
aware O
how O
little O
real O
sorrow O
was O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
how O
small O
an O
actual O
loss O
was O
this O
loss O
of O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
which O
bulked O
before O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
as O
an O
event O
of O
just O
as O
much O
magnitude O
as O
the O
loss O
, O
for O
example O
, O
which O
poor O
Mr B-PER
Lake O
, O
the B-PER
drawing-master I-PER
, O
was O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
suffering O
. O
It O
was O
even O
sad O
, O
in O
another O
point O
of O
view O
, O
to O
think O
of O
a B-PER
human I-PER
creature I-PER
passing O
out O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
and O
leaving O
so O
little O
trace O
that O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
there B-LOC
. O
As O
for O
the O
pretty O
creature O
whom O
Dr B-PER
Marjoribanks O
had O
married O
, O
she O
had O
vanished O
into O
thin O
air O
years O
and O
years O
ago O
. O
These O
thoughts O
were O
heavy O
enough O
-- O
perhaps O
even O
more O
overwhelming O
than O
that O
grief O
which O
develops O
love O
to O
its O
highest O
point O
of O
intensity O
. O
But O
such O
were O
not O
precisely O
the O
kind O
of O
reflections O
which O
could O
be O
solaced O
by O
paternal O
_ O
attendrissement O
_ O
over O
a B-PER
weeping I-PER
and I-PER
devoted I-PER
daughter I-PER
. O
It O
was O
May O
, O
and O
the O
weather O
was O
warm O
for O
the O
season O
; O
but O
Lucilla B-PER
had O
caused O
the O
fire O
to O
be O
lighted O
in O
the O
large O
gloomy O
library O
where O
Dr B-PER
Marjoribanks O
always O
sat O
in O
the O
evenings O
, O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
would O
be O
" O
a O
comfort O
" O
to O
him O
; O
and O
, O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
, O
she O
had O
ordered O
tea O
to O
be O
served O
there B-FAC
, O
instead O
of O
the O
dinner O
, O
for O
which O
her B-PER
father I-PER
, O
as O
she O
imagined O
, O
could O
have O
little O
appetite O
. O
When O
the B-PER
Doctor I-PER
went O
in O
to O
his B-FAC
favourite I-FAC
seclusion I-FAC
, O
tired O
and O
heated O
and O
sad O
-- O
for O
even O
on O
the O
day O
of O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
's O
funeral O
the O
favourite O
doctor O
of O
Carlingford B-GPE
had O
patients B-PER
to O
think O
of O
-- O
the O
very O
heaviness O
of O
his O
thoughts O
gave O
warmth O
to O
his O
indignation O
. O
He O
had O
longed O
for O
the O
quiet O
and O
the O
coolness O
and O
the O
solitude O
of O
his B-FAC
library I-FAC
, O
apart O
from O
everybody B-PER
; O
and O
when O
he O
found O
it O
radiant O
with O
firelight O
, O
tea O
set O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
Lucilla B-PER
crying O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
in O
her O
new O
crape O
, O
the O
effect O
upon O
a O
temper O
by O
no O
means O
perfect O
may O
be O
imagined O
. O
The B-PER
unfortunate I-PER
man I-PER
threw O
both O
the O
windows O
wide O
open O
and O
rang O
the O
bell O
violently O
, O
and O
gave O
instant O
orders O
for O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
unnecessary O
fire O
and O
the O
tea-service O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
know O
when O
dinner O
is O
ready O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
like O
thunder O
; O
" O
and O
if O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
wants O
a O
fire O
, O
let O
it O
be O
lighted O
in O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
. O
" O
Lucilla B-PER
was O
so O
much O
taken O
by O
surprise O
by O
this O
sudden O
overthrow O
of O
her O
programme O
, O
that O
she O
submitted O
, O
as O
a B-PER
girl I-PER
of I-PER
much I-PER
less I-PER
spirit I-PER
might O
have O
done O
, O
and O
suffered O
herself O
and O
her O
fire O
and O
her O
tea-things O
to O
be O
dismissed O
upstairs B-FAC
, O
where O
she O
wept O
still O
more O
at O
sight O
of O
dear B-PER
mamma I-PER
's O
sofa O
, O
and O
where O
Ellis B-PER
came O
to O
mingle O
her O
tears O
with O
those O
of O
her B-PER
young I-PER
mistress I-PER
, O
and O
to O
beg O
dear O
Miss B-PER
Lucilla O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
her O
precious O
' O
elth O
and O
her O
dear B-PER
papa I-PER
, O
to O
be O
persuaded O
to O
take O
some O
tea O
. O
On O
the O
whole O
, O
master B-PER
stood O
lessened O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
all B-PER
the I-PER
household I-PER
by O
his O
ability O
to O
eat O
his O
dinner O
, O
and O
his O
resentment O
at O
having O
his O
habitudes O
disturbed O
. O
" O
Them B-PER
men I-PER
would O
eat O
and O
drink O
if O
we O
was O
all O
in O
our O
graves O
, O
" O
said O
the B-PER
indignant I-PER
cook I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
indeed I-PER
had I-PER
a I-PER
real I-PER
grievance I-PER
; O
and O
the O
outraged O
sentiment O
of O
the B-PER
kitchen I-PER
was O
avenged O
by O
a O
bad O
and O
hasty O
dinner O
, O
which O
the B-PER
Doctor I-PER
, O
though O
generally O
" O
very O
particular O
, O
" O
swallowed O
without O
remark O
. O
About O
an O
hour O
afterwards O
he O
went O
upstairs B-FAC
to O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
, O
where O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
was O
waiting O
for O
him O
, O
much O
less O
at O
ease O
than O
she O
had O
expected O
to O
be O
. O
Though O
he O
gave O
a O
little O
sigh O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
's O
sofa O
, O
he O
did O
not O
hesitate O
to O
sit O
down O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
even O
to O
draw O
it O
a O
little O
out O
of O
its O
position O
, O
which O
, O
as O
Lucilla B-PER
described O
afterwards O
, O
was O
like O
a O
knife O
going O
into O
her O
heart O
. O
Though O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
had O
herself O
decided O
already O
, O
in O
the O
intervals O
of O
her O
tears O
, O
that O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
furniture O
had O
got O
very O
faded O
and O
shabby O
, O
and O
that O
it O
would O
be O
very O
expedient O
to O
have O
it O
renewed O
for O
the O
new O
reign O
of O
youth O
and O
energy O
which O
was O
about O
to O
commence O
. O
As O
for O
the B-PER
Doctor I-PER
, O
though O
Miss B-PER
Marjoribanks O
thought O
him O
insensible O
, O
his O
heart O
was O
heavy O
enough O
. O
His B-PER
wife I-PER
had O
gone O
out O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
without O
leaving O
the O
least O
mark O
of O
her O
existence O
, O
except O
in O
that O
large O
girl O
, O
whose O
spirits O
and O
forces O
were O
unbounded O
, O
but O
whose O
discretion O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
did O
not O
seem O
much O
greater O
than O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
. O
Instead O
of O
thinking O
of O
her O
as O
a O
comfort O
, O
the B-PER
Doctor I-PER
felt O
himself O
called O
upon O
to O
face O
a O
new O
and O
unexpected O
embarrassment O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
a O
satisfaction O
to O
him O
just O
then O
to O
have O
been O
left O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
permitted O
to O
work O
on O
quietly O
at O
his O
profession O
, O
and O
to O
write O
his O
papers O
for O
the O
_ O
Lancet O
_ O
, O
and O
to O
see O
his B-PER
friends I-PER
now O
and O
then O
when O
he O
chose O
; O
for O
Dr B-PER
Marjoribanks O
was O
not O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
any I-PER
great I-PER
need I-PER
of I-PER
sympathy I-PER
by I-PER
nature I-PER
, I-PER
or I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
at I-PER
all I-PER
addicted I-PER
to I-PER
demonstrations I-PER
of I-PER
feeling I-PER
; O
consequently O
, O
he O
drew O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
's O
sofa O
a O
little O
farther O
from O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
took O
his O
seat O
on O
it O
soberly O
, O
quite O
unaware O
that O
, O
by O
so O
doing O
, O
he O
was O
putting O
a O
knife O
into O
his B-PER
daughter I-PER
's O
heart O

PROLOGUE O
I O
A O
FACE O
haunted O
Cameron B-PER
-- O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
's O
face O
. O
It O
was O
there O
in O
the O
white O
heart O
of O
the O
dying O
campfire O
; O
it O
hung O
in O
the O
shadows O
that O
hovered O
over O
the O
flickering O
light O
; O
it O
drifted O
in O
the O
darkness O
beyond O
. O
This O
hour O
, O
when O
the O
day O
had O
closed O
and O
the O
lonely O
desert B-LOC
night O
set O
in O
with O
its O
dead O
silence O
, O
was O
one O
in O
which O
Cameron B-PER
's O
mind O
was O
thronged O
with O
memories O
of O
a O
time O
long O
past O
-- O
of O
a O
home O
back O
in O
Peoria B-GPE
, O
of O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
he I-PER
had I-PER
wronged I-PER
and I-PER
lost I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
loved I-PER
too I-PER
late I-PER
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
prospector I-PER
for I-PER
gold I-PER
, O
a B-PER
hunter I-PER
of I-PER
solitude I-PER
, O
a B-PER
lover I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
drear I-PER
, I-PER
rock-ribbed I-PER
infinitude I-PER
, O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
alone O
to O
remember O
. O
A O
sound O
disturbed O
Cameron B-PER
's O
reflections O
. O
He O
bent O
his O
head O
listening O
. O
A O
soft O
wind O
fanned O
the O
paling O
embers O
, O
blew O
sparks O
and O
white O
ashes O
and O
thin O
smoke O
away O
into O
the O
enshrouding O
circle O
of O
blackness O
. O
His O
burro O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
moving O
about O
. O
The O
quiet O
split O
to O
the O
cry O
of O
a O
coyote O
. O
It O
rose O
strange O
, O
wild O
, O
mournful O
-- O
not O
the O
howl O
of O
a O
prowling O
upland O
beast O
baying O
the O
campfire O
or O
barking O
at O
a B-PER
lonely I-PER
prospector I-PER
, O
but O
the O
wail O
of O
a O
wolf O
, O
full-voiced O
, O
crying O
out O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
desert B-LOC
and O
the O
night O
. O
Hunger O
throbbed O
in O
it O
-- O
hunger O
for O
a O
mate O
, O
for O
offspring O
, O
for O
life O
. O
When O
it O
ceased O
, O
the O
terrible O
desert B-LOC
silence O
smote O
Cameron O
, O
and O
the O
cry O
echoed O
in O
his O
soul O
. O
He O
and O
that O
wandering O
wolf O
were O
brothers O
. O
Then O
a O
sharp O
clink O
of O
metal O
on O
stone O
and O
soft O
pads O
of O
hoofs O
in O
sand O
prompted O
Cameron B-PER
to O
reach O
for O
his O
gun O
, O
and O
to O
move O
out O
of O
the O
light O
of O
the O
waning O
campfire O
. O
He O
was O
somewhere O
along O
the O
wild O
border O
line O
between O
Sonora B-LOC
and O
Arizona B-GPE
; O
and O
the B-PER
prospector I-PER
who I-PER
dared I-PER
the I-PER
heat I-PER
and I-PER
barrenness I-PER
of I-PER
that I-PER
region I-PER
risked O
other O
dangers O
sometimes O
as O
menacing O
. O
Figures O
darker O
than O
the O
gloom O
approached O
and O
took O
shape O
, O
and O
in O
the O
light O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
those O
of O
a B-PER
white I-PER
man I-PER
and O
a O
heavily O
packed O
burro O
. O
" O
Hello O
there O
, O
" O
the B-PER
man I-PER
called O
, O
as O
he O
came O
to O
a O
halt O
and O
gazed O
about O
him O
. O
" O
I O
saw O
your O
fire O
. O
May O
I O
make O
camp O
here O
? O
" O
Cameron B-PER
came O
forth O
out O
of O
the O
shadow O
and O
greeted O
his O
visitor O
, O
whom O
he O
took O
for O
a B-PER
prospector I-PER
like I-PER
himself I-PER
. O
Cameron B-PER
resented O
the O
breaking O
of O
his O
lonely O
campfire O
vigil O
, O
but O
he O
respected O
the O
law O
of O
the B-LOC
desert I-LOC
. O
The B-PER
stranger I-PER
thanked O
him O
, O
and O
then O
slipped O
the O
pack O
from O
his O
burro O
. O
Then O
he O
rolled O
out O
his O
pack O
and O
began O
preparations O
for O
a O
meal O
. O
His O
movements O
were O
slow O
and O
methodical O
. O
Cameron B-PER
watched O
him O
, O
still O
with O
resentment O
, O
yet O
with O
a O
curious O
and O
growing O
interest O
. O
The O
campfire O
burst O
into O
a O
bright O
blaze O
, O
and O
by O
its O
light O
Cameron B-PER
saw O
a B-PER
man I-PER
whose I-PER
gray I-PER
hair I-PER
somehow I-PER
did I-PER
not I-PER
seem I-PER
to I-PER
make I-PER
him I-PER
old I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
whose I-PER
stooped I-PER
shoulders I-PER
did I-PER
not I-PER
detract I-PER
from I-PER
an I-PER
impression I-PER
of I-PER
rugged I-PER
strength I-PER
. O
" O
Find O
any O
mineral O
? O
" O
asked O
Cameron B-PER
, O
presently O
. O
His B-PER
visitor I-PER
looked O
up O
quickly O
, O
as O
if O
startled O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
human O
voice O
. O
He O
replied O
, O
and O
then O
the B-PER
two I-PER
men I-PER
talked O
a O
little O
. O
But O
the B-PER
stranger I-PER
evidently O
preferred O
silence O
. O
Cameron B-PER
understood O
that O
. O
He O
laughed O
grimly O
and O
bent O
a O
keener O
gaze O
upon O
the O
furrowed O
, O
shadowy O
face O
. O
Another O
of O
those B-PER
strange I-PER
desert I-PER
prospectors I-PER
in I-PER
whom I-PER
there I-PER
was I-PER
some I-PER
relentless I-PER
driving I-PER
power I-PER
besides I-PER
the I-PER
lust I-PER
for I-PER
gold I-PER
! O
Cameron B-PER
felt O
that O
between O
this B-PER
man I-PER
and O
himself O
there O
was O
a O
subtle O
affinity O
, O
vague O
and O
undefined O
, O
perhaps O
born O
of O
the O
divination O
that O
here O
was O
a O
desert B-LOC
wanderer O
like O
himself O
, O
perhaps O
born O
of O
a O
deeper O
, O
an O
unintelligible O
relation O
having O
its O
roots O
back O
in O
the O
past O
. O
A O
long-forgotten O
sensation O
stirred O
in O
Cameron B-PER
's O
breast O
, O
one O
so O
long O
forgotten O
that O
he O
could O
not O
recognize O
it O
. O
But O
it O
was O
akin O
to O
pain O
. O
II O
When O
he O
awakened O
he O
found O
, O
to O
his O
surprise O
, O
that O
his B-PER
companion I-PER
had O
departed O
. O
A O
trail O
in O
the O
sand O
led O
off O
to O
the O
north O
. O
There O
was O
no O
water O
in O
that O
direction O
. O
Cameron B-PER
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
; O
it O
was O
not O
his O
affair O
; O
he O
had O
his O
own O
problems O
. O
And O
straightway O
he O
forgot O
his B-PER
strange I-PER
visitor I-PER
. O
Cameron B-PER
began O
his O
day O
, O
grateful O
for O
the O
solitude O
that O
was O
now O
unbroken O
, O
for O
the O
canyon-furrowed B-LOC
and O
cactus-spired O
scene O
that O
now O
showed O
no O
sign O
of O
life O
. O
He O
traveled O
southwest O
, O
never O
straying O
far O
from O
the B-LOC
dry I-LOC
stream I-LOC
bed I-LOC
; O
and O
in O
a O
desultory O
way O
, O
without O
eagerness O
, O
he O
hunted O
for O
signs O
of O
gold O
. O
The O
work O
was O
toilsome O
, O
yet O
the O
periods O
of O
rest O
in O
which O
he O
indulged O
were O
not O
taken O
because O
of O
fatigue O
. O
He O
rested O
to O
look O
, O
to O
listen O
, O
to O
feel O
. O
What O
the B-LOC
vast I-LOC
silent I-LOC
world I-LOC
meant O
to O
him O
had O
always O
been O
a O
mystical O
thing O
, O
which O
he O
felt O
in O
all O
its O
incalculable O
power O
, O
but O
never O
understood O
. O
That O
day O
, O
while O
it O
was O
yet O
light O
, O
and O
he O
was O
digging O
in O
a O
moist O
white-bordered O
wash O
for O
water O
, O
he O
was O
brought O
sharply O
up O
by O
hearing O
the O
crack O
of O
hard O
hoofs O
on O
stone O
. O
There O
down O
the B-LOC
canyon I-LOC
came O
a B-PER
man I-PER
and O
a O
burro O
. O
Cameron B-PER
recognized O
them O
. O
" O
Hello O
, O
friend O
, O
" O
called O
the B-PER
man I-PER
, O
halting O
. O
" O
Our O
trails O
crossed O
again O
. O
That O
's O
good O
. O
" O
" O
Hello O
, O
" O
replied O
Cameron B-PER
, O
slowly O
. O
" O
Any O
mineral O
sign O
to-day O
? O
" O
" O
No O
. O
" O
They O
made O
camp O
together O
, O
ate O
their O
frugal O
meal O
, O
smoked O
a O
pipe O
, O
and O
rolled O
in O
their O
blankets O
without O
exchanging O
many O
words O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
the O
same O
reticence O
, O
the O
same O
aloofness O
characterized O
the O
manner O
of O
both O
. O
But O
Cameron B-PER
's O
companion O
, O
when O
he O
had O
packed O
his O
burro O
and O
was O
ready O
to O
start O
, O
faced O
about O
and O
said O
: O
" O
We O
might O
stay O
together O
, O
if O
it O
's O
all O
right O
with O
you O
. O
" O
" O
I O
never O
take O
a B-PER
partner I-PER
, O
" O
replied O
Cameron B-PER
. O
" O
You O
're O
alone O
; O
I O
'm O
alone O
, O
" O
said O
the O
other O
, O
mildly O
. O
" O
It O
's O
a O
big O
place O
. O
If O
we O
find O
gold O
there O
'll O
be O
enough O
for O
two O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
go O
down O
into O
the B-LOC
desert I-LOC
for O
gold O
alone O
, O
" O
rejoined O
Cameron B-PER
, O
with O
a O
chill O
note O
in O
his O
swift O
reply O
. O
His B-PER
companion I-PER
's O
deep-set O
, O
luminous O
eyes O
emitted O
a O
singular O
flash O
. O
It O
moved O
Cameron B-PER
to O
say O
that O
in O
the O
years O
of O
his O
wandering O
he O
had O
met O
no O
man O
who O
could O
endure O
equally O
with O
him O
the O
blasting O
heat O
, O
the O
blinding O
dust O
storms O
, O
the B-LOC
wilderness I-LOC
of I-LOC
sand I-LOC
and I-LOC
rock I-LOC
and I-LOC
lava I-LOC
and I-LOC
cactus I-LOC
, O
the O
terrible O
silence O
and O
desolation O
of O
the B-LOC
desert I-LOC
. O
Cameron B-PER
waved O
a O
hand O
toward O
the O
wide O
, O
shimmering O
, O
shadowy O
descent O
of O
plain B-LOC
and O
range B-LOC
. O
" O
I O
may O
strike O
through O
the B-LOC
Sonora I-LOC
Desert I-LOC
. O
I O
may O
head O
for O
Pinacate B-GPE
or O
north O
for O
the B-LOC
Colorado I-LOC
Basin I-LOC
. O
You O
are O
an B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
but O
to O
me O
one O
place O
is O
the O
same O
as O
another O
, O
" O
replied O
his B-PER
companion I-PER
. O
For O
moments O
he O
seemed O
to O
forget O
himself O
, O
and O
swept O
his O
far-reaching O
gaze O
out O
over O
the B-LOC
colored I-LOC
gulf I-LOC
of I-LOC
stone I-LOC
and I-LOC
sand I-LOC
. O
Then O
with O
gentle O
slaps O
he O
drove O
his O
burro O
in O
behind O
Cameron B-PER
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
'm O
old O
. O
I O
'm O
lonely O
, O
too O
. O
It O
's O
come O
to O
me O
just O
lately O
. O
But O
, O
friend B-PER
, O
I O
can O
still O
travel O
, O
and O
for O
a O
few O
days O
my O
company O
wo O
n't O
hurt O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Have O
it O
your O
way O
, O
" O
said O
Cameron B-PER
. O
They O
began O
a O
slow O
march O
down O
into O
the B-LOC
desert I-LOC
. O
At O
sunset O
they O
camped O
under O
the O
lee O
of O
a B-LOC
low I-LOC
mesa I-LOC
. O
Cameron B-PER
was O
glad O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
had O
the O
Indian O
habit O
of O
silence O
. O
Another O
day O
's O
travel O
found O
the B-PER
prospectors I-PER
deep O
in O
the B-LOC
wilderness I-LOC
. O
Then O
there O
came O
a O
breaking O
of O
reserve O
, O
noticeable O
in O
the B-PER
elder I-PER
man I-PER
, O
almost O
imperceptibly O
gradual O
in O
Cameron B-PER
. O
Beside O
the O
meager O
mesquite O
campfire O
this B-PER
gray-faced I-PER
, I-PER
thoughtful I-PER
old I-PER
prospector I-PER
would O
remove O
his O
black O
pipe O
from O
his O
mouth O
to O
talk O
a O
little O
; O
and O
Cameron B-PER
would O
listen O
, O
and O
sometimes O
unlock O
his O
lips O
to O
speak O
a O
word O
. O
And O
so O
, O
as O
Cameron B-PER
began O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
influence O
of O
a B-LOC
desert I-LOC
less I-LOC
lonely I-LOC
than I-LOC
habitual I-LOC
, O
he O
began O
to O
take O
keener O
note O
of O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
, O
and O
found O
him O
different O
from O
any O
other O
he O
had O
ever O
encountered O
in O
the B-LOC
wilderness I-LOC
. O
This B-PER
man I-PER
never O
grumbled O
at O
the O
heat O
, O
the O
glare O
, O
the O
driving O
sand O
, O
the O
sour O
water O
, O
the O
scant O
fare O
. O
During O
the O
daylight O
hours O
he O
was O
seldom O
idle O
. O
At O
night O
he O
sat O
dreaming O
before O
the O
fire O
or O
paced O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
gloom O
. O
He O
slept O
but O
little O
, O
and O
that O
long O
after O
Cameron B-PER
had O
had O
his O
own O
rest O
. O
He O
was O
tireless O
, O
patient O
, O
brooding O
. O
Cameron B-PER
's O
awakened O
interest O
brought O
home O
to O
him O
the O
realization O
that O
for O
years O
he O
had O
shunned O
companionship O
. O
In O
those O
years O
only B-PER
three I-PER
men I-PER
had O
wandered O
into O
the B-LOC
desert I-LOC
with O
him O
, O
and O
these O
had O
left O
their O
bones O
to O
bleach O
in O
the B-LOC
shifting I-LOC
sands I-LOC
. O
Cameron B-PER
had O
not O
cared O
to O
know O
their O
secrets O
. O
But O
the O
more O
he O
studied O
this B-PER
latest I-PER
comrade I-PER
the O
more O
he O
began O
to O
suspect O
that O
he O
might O
have O
missed O
something O
in O
the B-PER
others I-PER
. O
In O
his O
own O
driving O
passion O
to O
take O
his O
secret O
into O
the O
limitless O
abode O
of O
silence O
and O
desolation O
, O
where O
he O
could O
be O
alone O
with O
it O
, O
he O
had O
forgotten O
that O
life O
dealt O
shocks O
to O
other B-PER
men I-PER
. O
Somehow O
this B-PER
silent I-PER
comrade I-PER
reminded O
him O
. O
One O
afternoon O
late O
, O
after O
they O
had O
toiled O
up O
a B-LOC
white I-LOC
, I-LOC
winding I-LOC
wash I-LOC
of I-LOC
sand I-LOC
and I-LOC
gravel I-LOC
, O
they O
came O
upon O
a B-LOC
dry I-LOC
waterhole I-LOC
. O
Cameron B-PER
dug O
deep O
into O
the B-LOC
sand I-LOC
, O
but O
without O
avail O
. O
He O
was O
turning O
to O
retrace O
weary O
steps O
back O
to O
the B-LOC
last I-LOC
water I-LOC
when O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
asked O
him O
to O
wait O
. O
Cameron B-PER
watched O
him O
search O
in O
his O
pack O
and O
bring O
forth O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
small O
, O
forked O
branch O
of O
a O
peach O
tree O
. O
He O
grasped O
the O
prongs O
of O
the O
fork O
and O
held O
them O
before O
him O
with O
the O
end O
standing O
straight O
out O
, O
and O
then O
he O
began O
to O
walk O
along O
the B-LOC
stream I-LOC
bed I-LOC
. O
Cameron B-PER
, O
at O
first O
amused O
, O
then O
amazed O
, O
then O
pitying O
, O
and O
at O
last O
curious O
, O
kept O
pace O
with O
the B-PER
prospector I-PER
. O
He O
saw O
a O
strong O
tension O
of O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
's O
wrists O
, O
as O
if O
he O
was O
holding O
hard O
against O
a O
considerable O
force O
. O
The O
end O
of O
the O
peach O
branch O
began O
to O
quiver O
and O
turn O
. O
Cameron B-PER
reached O
out O
a O
hand O
to O
touch O
it O
, O
and O
was O
astounded O
at O
feeling O
a O
powerful O
vibrant O
force O
pulling O
the O
branch O
downward O
. O
He O
felt O
it O
as O
a O
magnetic O
shock O
. O
The O
branch O
kept O
turning O
, O
and O
at O
length O
pointed O
to O
the B-LOC
ground I-LOC
. O
" O
Dig O
here B-LOC
, O
" O
said O
the B-PER
prospector I-PER
. O
" O
What O
! O
" O
ejaculated O
Cameron B-PER
. O
Had O
the B-PER
man I-PER
lost O
his O
mind O
? O
Then O
Cameron B-PER
stood O
by O
while O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
dug O
in O
the B-LOC
sand I-LOC
. O
Three O
feet O
he O
dug O
-- O
four O
-- O
five O
, O
and O
the O
sand O
grew O
dark O
, O
then O
moist O
. O
At O
six O
feet O
water O
began O
to O
seep O
through O
. O
" O
Get O
the O
little O
basket O
in O
my O
pack O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
Cameron B-PER
complied O
, O
and O
saw O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
drop O
the O
basket O
into O
the B-FAC
deep I-FAC
hole I-FAC
, O
where O
it O
kept O
the O
sides O
from O
caving O
in O
and O
allowed O
the O
water O
to O
seep O
through O
. O
While O
Cameron B-PER
watched O
, O
the O
basket O
filled O
. O
Of O
all O
the O
strange O
incidents O
of O
his O
desert B-LOC
career O
this O
was O
the O
strangest O
. O
Curiously O
he O
picked O
up O
the O
peach O
branch O
and O
held O
it O
as O
he O
had O
seen O
it O
held O
. O
The O
thing O
, O
however O
, O
was O
dead O
in O
his O
hands O

I O
I O
ON O
a O
hill O
by O
the B-LOC
Mississippi I-LOC
where O
Chippewas B-PER
camped O
two O
generations O
ago O
, O
a B-PER
girl I-PER
stood O
in O
relief O

the O
cornflower O

of O
Northern O

. O
She O
saw O
no B-PER
Indians I-PER
now O

she O
saw O
flour-mills B-FAC
and O
the O
blinking O
windows O
of O
skyscrapers O
in O
Minneapolis B-GPE
and O
St. B-PER
Paul O
. O
Nor O
was O
she O
thinking O

and O
the B-PER
Yankee I-PER
fur-traders I-PER
whose I-PER

were I-PER
all I-PER
about I-PER
her I-PER

She O
was O
meditating O
upon O
walnut O
fudge O
, O
the O
plays O
of O
Brieux B-PER
, O
the O
reasons O
why O
heels B-PER
run O

the O
fact O
that O
the B-PER
chemistry I-PER

had O
stared O
at O
the O
new O

which O
concealed O
her O

A O

a O
line O
so O
graceful O

so O
full O
of O
animation O
and O
moving O
beauty O
, O
that O
the O
heart O
of O
a B-PER
chance I-PER
watcher I-PER
on O
the B-FAC
lower I-FAC
road I-FAC
tightened O
to O
wistfulness O
over O
her O
quality O

freedom O

She O
lifted O
her O
arms O

she O
leaned O

and O
one O
lady O

who O
really O

Milton B-PER

Carlyle B-PER

So O
the O
four O
years O
which O
Carol B-PER
spent O
at O
Blodgett B-FAC
were O
not O
altogether O
wasted O
. O
The O
smallness O
of O
the B-FAC
school I-FAC
, O
the O
fewness O
of O
rivals B-PER
, O
permitted O
her O
to O
experiment O
with O
her O
perilous O

. O
She O
played O
tennis O
, O
gave O
chafing-dish O
parties O

took O
a O

in O
the O

went O

In O

were O
two B-PER

three I-PER
prettier I-PER
girls I-PER
, O
but O
none O
more O
eager O

She O
was O
noticeable O
equally O
in O
the O
classroom O

at O
dances O
, O
though O
out O
of O
the O
three O
hundred O
students O
of O
Blodgett B-FAC
, O
scores O
recited O
more O
accurately O

dozens O

more O

Every O

her O

was O
alive O
-- O
thin O

quince-blossom O
skin O
, O
ingenue O
eyes O
, O
black O

. O
The O
other O
girls O
in O
her B-FAC
dormitory I-FAC
marveled O
at O
the O
slightness O
of O
her O
body O
when O
they O
saw O
her O
in O
sheer O
negligee O
, O
or O
darting O
out O
wet O
from O
a O
shower-bath O
. O
She O
seemed O
then O
but O
half O
as O
large O
as O
they O
had O
supposed O
; O
a B-PER
fragile I-PER
child I-PER
who I-PER
must I-PER
be I-PER
cloaked I-PER
with I-PER
understanding I-PER
kindness I-PER
. O
“ O
Psychic O

” O
the B-PER
girls I-PER
whispered O
, O
and O
“ O
spiritual O

” O
Yet O
so O
radioactive O
were O
her O
nerves O
, O
so O
adventurous O
her O
trust O
in O
rather O
vaguely O
conceived O
sweetness O

light O
, O
that O
she O
was O
more O
energetic O
than O
any O
of O
the O
hulking O

with O

heavy-ribbed O

Even O
when O

her O
dark O

were O

She O
did O
not O
yet O
know O
the O
immense O

the B-LOC

to O
be O
casually O
cruel O

but O
if O
she O
should O
ever O
learn O
those O
dismaying O
powers O
, O
her O
eyes O
would O
never O
become O
sullen O

heavy O
or O
rheumily O

For O
all O
her O

for O
all O
the O

the O
“ O

which O
she O
inspired O
, O
Carol B-PER
’s O
acquaintances O
were O
shy O
of O
her O
. O
When O
she O
was O
most O
ardently O
singing O
hymns O
or O
planning O
deviltry O
she O
yet O
seemed O
gently O
aloof O
and O
critical O
. O
She O
was O
credulous O
, O
perhaps O
; O
a B-PER
born I-PER
hero-worshipper I-PER

yet O
she O
did O
question O

examine O
unceasingly O

Whatever O
she O
might O
become O
she O
would O
never O
be O
static O

Her O
versatility O
ensnared O

By O

As O
for O
Carol B-PER
, O
she O
was O
an B-PER
orphan I-PER
; O
her B-PER
only I-PER
near I-PER
relative I-PER
was O
a O
vanilla-flavored O
sister O
married O
to O
an O
optician O
in O
St. B-PER
Paul O
. O
She O
had O
used O
most O
of O
the O
money O
from O
her B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
estate O
. O
She O
was O
not O
in O
love O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
not O
often O
, O
nor O
ever O
long O
at O
a O
time O

She O
would O
earn O
her O
living O

But O
how O
she O
was O
to O
earn O
it O
, O
how O
she O
was O
to O
conquer O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
-- O
almost O
entirely O
for O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC

own O
good O
-- O
she O
did O
not O
see O

Most O
of O
the B-PER
girls I-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
not I-PER
betrothed I-PER
meant O
to O
be O
teachers B-PER
. O
Of O
these O
there O
were O
two O
sorts O
: O
careless O
young O
women O
who O
admitted O
that O
they O
intended O
to O
leave O
the O
“ O
beastly B-FAC
classroom I-FAC
and O
grubby B-PER
children I-PER
” O
the O
minute O
they O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
marry O
; O
and O
studious O
, O
sometimes O
bulbous-browed O
and O
pop-eyed O
maidens O
who O
at O
class O
prayer-meetings O
requested O
God B-PER
to O
“ O
guide O
their O
feet O
along O
the O
paths O
of O
greatest O
usefulness O
. O
” O
Neither O
sort O
tempted O
Carol B-PER
. O
The O
former O
seemed O
insincere O
( O
a O
favorite O
word O
of O
hers O
at O
this O
era O
) O
. O
The B-PER
earnest I-PER
virgins I-PER
were O
, O
she O
fancied O
, O
as O
likely O
to O
do O
harm O
as O
to O
do O
good O
by O
their O
faith O
in O
the O
value O
of O

Caesar B-PER

At O
various O
times O
during O
Senior O

Carol B-PER
finally O
decided O
upon O
studying O
law O

writing O
motion-picture O
scenarios O
, O
professional O
nursing O

and O
marrying O
an B-PER
unidentified I-PER

Then O
she O
found O
a O
hobby O
in O
sociology O
. O
The B-PER
sociology I-PER
instructor I-PER
was O
new O

He O
was O
married O

therefore O
taboo O

he O
had O
come O

millionaire B-PER
uplifters I-PER
at O
the O

and O
he O
had O
a O

He O
led O
a O

the O

Trailing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O

Carol B-PER
was O
indignant O
at O
the O
prodding O
curiosity O
of O
the O
others O
, O
their O
manner O
of O
staring O
at O
the B-PER
poor I-PER

She O
felt O
herself O
a B-PER
great I-PER
liberator I-PER

She O
put O
her O

to O
her O

her O

quite O
painfully O
pinching O
her O

an O
inference O
of O
this O
kind O
could O
not O
so O
indubitably O
be O
drawn O
. O
It O
might O
be O
that O
a B-PER
sluggish I-PER
bond-servant I-PER
, O
or O
an O
undutiful O
child O
, O
whom O
his B-PER
parents I-PER
had O
given O
over O
to O
the B-ORG
civil I-ORG
authority I-ORG
, O
was O
to O
be O
corrected O
at O
the O
whipping-post O

It O
might O
be O
that O
an B-PER
Antinomian I-PER
, O
a B-PER
Quaker I-PER
, O
or O
other B-PER
heterodox I-PER
religionist I-PER
, O
was O
to O
be O
scourged O
out O
of O
the B-GPE

an O
idle O

vagrant O
Indian O

whom O
the B-PER
white I-PER
man I-PER

made O
riotous O
about O
the B-FAC

, O
was O
to O
be O
driven O
with O

into O
the O
shadow O
of O
the B-LOC

It O
might O
be O
, O
too O
, O
that O
a B-PER
witch I-PER
, O
like O
old O
Mistress B-PER
Hibbins O
, O
the O
bitter-tempered O
widow O
of O
the B-PER
magistrate I-PER

was O
to O
die O
upon O
the O
gallows O

In O
either O
case O

there O
was O
very O
much O
the O
same O
solemnity O
of O
demeanour O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the B-PER
spectators I-PER
, O
as O
befitted O
a B-PER
people I-PER
among I-PER
whom I-PER
religion I-PER
and I-PER
law I-PER
were I-PER
almost I-PER
identical I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
in I-PER
whose I-PER
character I-PER
both I-PER
were I-PER
so I-PER
thoroughly I-PER
interfused I-PER
, I-PER
that I-PER
the I-PER
mildest I-PER

severest I-PER
acts I-PER
of I-PER
public I-PER
discipline I-PER
were I-PER
alike I-PER
made I-PER
venerable I-PER

awful I-PER

Meagre O
, O
indeed O
, O
and O
cold O
, O
was O
the O
sympathy O
that O
a B-PER
transgressor I-PER
might O
look O
for O
, O
from O
such B-PER
bystanders I-PER
, O
at O
the O
scaffold O

On O
the O
other O
hand O

a O
penalty O
which O
, O
in O
our O
days O
, O
would O
infer O
a O
degree O
of O
mocking O
infamy O
and O
ridicule O
, O
might O
then O
be O
invested O
with O
almost O
as O
stern O
a O
dignity O
as O
the O
punishment O
of O
death O
itself O
. O
It O
was O
a O
circumstance O
to O
be O
noted O
on O
the O
summer O
morning O
when O
our O
story O
begins O
its O
course O
, O
that O
the B-PER
women I-PER

of O
whom O
there O
were O
several O
in O
the O

appeared O
to O
take O
a O
peculiar O
interest O
in O
whatever O
penal O
infliction O
might O
be O
expected O
to O
ensue O
. O
The O
age O
had O
not O
so O
much O
refinement O

that O
any O
sense O
of O
impropriety O
restrained O
the B-PER
wearers I-PER
of I-PER
petticoat I-PER

farthingale I-PER
from O
stepping O
forth O
into O
the O
public O

their B-PER
not I-PER
unsubstantial I-PER
persons I-PER

if O

into O
the O

Morally O

as O
well O
as O

there O
was O
a O
coarser O

those B-PER
wives I-PER

of I-PER
old I-PER
English I-PER

for O

throughout O

The B-PER
women I-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
now I-PER
standing I-PER
about I-PER
the I-PER

within O
less O

half O
a O

of O
the O

when O
the B-PER
man-like I-PER

the O

herself O

" O
The O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
jail I-FAC

flung O
open O
from O
within O
there O
appeared O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
like O
a O
black O
shadow O
emerging O
into O
sunshine O
, O
the O
grim O
and O
grisly O
presence O
of O
the B-PER
town-beadle I-PER
, O
with O
a O
sword O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
his O
staff O
of O
office O
in O
his O
hand O
. O
This B-PER
personage I-PER
prefigured O
and O
represented O
in O
his O
aspect O
the O
whole O
dismal O
severity O
of O
the O
Puritanic O
code O
of O
law O
, O
which O
it O
was O
his O
business O
to O
administer O
in O
its O
final O
and O
closest O
application O
to O
the B-PER
offender I-PER
. O
Stretching O
forth O
the O
official O
staff O
in O
his O
left O
hand O
, O
he O
laid O
his O
right O
upon O
the O
shoulder O
of O
a B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
whom O
he O
thus O
drew O
forward O
, O
until O
, O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
prison-door O
, O
she O
repelled O
him O
, O
by O
an O
action O
marked O
with O
natural O
dignity O
and O
force O
of O
character O
, O
and O
stepped O
into O
the O
open O
air O
as O
if O
by O
her O
own O
free O
will O
. O
She O
bore O
in O
her O
arms O
a B-PER
child I-PER
, O
a B-PER
baby I-PER
of I-PER
some I-PER
three I-PER
months I-PER
old I-PER
, O
who O
winked O
and O
turned O
aside O
its O
little O
face O
from O
the O
too O
vivid O
light O
of O
day O
; O
because O
its O
existence O
, O
heretofore O
, O
had O
brought O
it O
acquaintance O
only O
with O
the O
grey O
twilight O
of O
a B-FAC
dungeon I-FAC
, O
or O
other B-FAC
darksome I-FAC
apartment I-FAC
of O
the B-FAC
prison I-FAC

When O
the B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
-- O
the O
mother O
of O
this B-PER
child I-PER
-- O
stood O
fully O
revealed O
before O
the O
crowd O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
her O
first O
impulse O
to O
clasp O
the B-PER
infant I-PER
closely O
to O
her O
bosom O
; O
not O
so O
much O
by O
an O
impulse O
of O
motherly O
affection O
, O
as O
that O
she O
might O
thereby O
conceal O
a O
certain O
token O
, O
which O
was O
wrought O
or O
fastened O
into O
her O
dress O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
wisely O
judging O
that O
one O
token O
of O
her O
shame O
would O
but O
poorly O
serve O
to O
hide O
another O
, O
she O
took O
the B-PER
baby I-PER
on O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
with O
a O
burning O
blush O
, O
and O
yet O
a O
haughty O
smile O
, O
and O
a O
glance O
that O
would O
not O
be O
abashed O
, O
looked O
around O
at O
her O
townspeople B-PER
and O
neighbours B-PER
. O
On O
the O
breast O
of O
her O
gown O
, O
in O
fine O
red O
cloth O
, O
surrounded O
with O
an O
elaborate O
embroidery O
and O
fantastic O
flourishes O
of O
gold O
thread O
, O
appeared O
the O
letter O
A O
. O
It O
was O
so O
artistically O
done O
, O
and O
with O
so O
much O
fertility O
and O
gorgeous O
luxuriance O
of O
fancy O
, O
that O
it O
had O
all O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
last O
and O
fitting O
decoration O
to O
the O
apparel O
which O
she O
wore O
, O
and O
which O
was O
of O
a O
splendour O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
age O
, O
but O
greatly O
beyond O
what O
was O
allowed O
by O
the O
sumptuary O
regulations O
of O
the B-GPE

CHAPTER O
I O
— O
START O
IN O
LIFE O
I O
was O
born O
in O
the O
year O
1632 O
, O
in O
the B-GPE
city I-GPE
of I-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
of O
a B-PER
good I-PER
family I-PER
, O
though O
not O
of O
that B-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
my B-PER
father I-PER
being O
a O
foreigner O
of O
Bremen B-GPE
, O
who O
settled O
first O
at O
Hull B-GPE
. O
He O
got O
a O
good O
estate O
by O
merchandise O
, O
and O
leaving O
off O
his O
trade O
, O
lived O
afterwards O
at O
York B-GPE
, O
from O
whence O
he O
had O
married O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
whose O
relations O
were O
named O
Robinson B-PER
, O
a B-PER
very I-PER
good I-PER
family I-PER
in O
that B-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
and O
from O
whom O
I O
was O
called O
Robinson B-PER
Kreutznaer I-PER
; O
but O
, O
by O
the O
usual O
corruption O
of O
words O
in O
England B-GPE
, O
we O
are O
now O
called O
— O
nay O
we O
call O
ourselves O
and O
write O
our O
name O
— O
Crusoe B-PER
; O
and O
so O
my B-PER
companions I-PER
always O
called O
me O
. O
I O
had O
two B-PER
elder I-PER
brothers I-PER
, O
one O
of O
whom O
was O
lieutenant-colonel O
to O
an O
English O
regiment O
of O
foot O
in O
Flanders B-GPE
, O
formerly O
commanded O
by O
the B-PER
famous I-PER
Colonel I-PER
Lockhart B-PER
, O
and O
was O
killed O
at O
the O
battle O
near O
Dunkirk B-GPE
against O
the B-GPE
Spaniards I-GPE
. O
What O
became O
of O
my B-PER
second I-PER
brother I-PER
I O
never O
knew O
, O
any O
more O
than O
my B-PER
father I-PER
or O
mother B-PER
knew O
what O
became O
of O
me O
. O
Being O
the B-PER
third I-PER
son I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
family I-PER
and O
not O
bred O
to O
any O
trade O
, O
my O
head O
began O
to O
be O
filled O
very O
early O
with O
rambling O
thoughts O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
very I-PER
ancient I-PER
, O
had O
given O
me O
a O
competent O
share O
of O
learning O
, O
as O
far O
as O
house-education O
and O
a B-FAC
country I-FAC
free I-FAC
school I-FAC
generally O
go O
, O
and O
designed O
me O
for O
the O
law O
; O
but O
I O
would O
be O
satisfied O
with O
nothing O
but O
going O
to O
sea B-LOC
; O
and O
my O
inclination O
to O
this O
led O
me O
so O
strongly O
against O
the O
will O
, O
nay O
, O
the O
commands O
of O
my B-PER
father I-PER
, O
and O
against O
all O
the O
entreaties O
and O
persuasions O
of O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
and O
other O
friends B-PER
, O
that O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
something O
fatal O
in O
that O
propensity O
of O
nature O
, O
tending O
directly O
to O
the O
life O
of O
misery O
which O
was O
to O
befall O
me O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
, O
a B-PER
wise I-PER
and I-PER
grave I-PER
man I-PER
, O
gave O
me O
serious O
and O
excellent O
counsel O
against O
what O
he O
foresaw O
was O
my O
design O
. O
He O
called O
me O
one O
morning O
into O
his B-FAC
chamber I-FAC
, O
where O
he O
was O
confined O
by O
the O
gout O
, O
and O
expostulated O
very O
warmly O
with O
me O
upon O
this O
subject O
. O
He O
asked O
me O
what O
reasons O
, O
more O
than O
a O
mere O
wandering O
inclination O
, O
I O
had O
for O
leaving O
father B-PER
’s O
house O
and O
my B-GPE
native I-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
where O
I O
might O
be O
well O
introduced O
, O
and O
had O
a O
prospect O
of O
raising O
my O
fortune O
by O
application O
and O
industry O
, O
with O
a O
life O
of O
ease O
and O
pleasure O
. O
He O
told O
me O
it O
was O
men B-PER
of I-PER
desperate I-PER
fortunes I-PER
on I-PER
one I-PER
hand I-PER
, I-PER
or I-PER
of I-PER
aspiring I-PER
, I-PER
superior I-PER
fortunes I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
other I-PER
, I-PER
who O
went O
abroad O
upon O
adventures O
, O
to O
rise O
by O
enterprise O
, O
and O
make O
themselves O
famous O
in O
undertakings O
of O
a O
nature O
out O
of O
the O
common O
road O
; O
that O
these O
things O
were O
all O
either O
too O
far O
above O
me O
or O
too O
far O
below O
me O
; O
that O
mine O
was O
the O
middle O
state O
, O
or O
what O
might O
be O
called O
the O
upper O
station O
of O
low O
life O
, O
which O
he O
had O
found O
, O
by O
long O
experience O
, O
was O
the O
best O
state O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
the O
most O
suited O
to O
human O
happiness O
, O
not O
exposed O
to O
the O
miseries O
and O
hardships O
, O
the O
labour O
and O
sufferings O
of O
the B-PER
mechanic I-PER
part I-PER
of I-PER
mankind I-PER
, O
and O
not O
embarrassed O
with O
the O
pride O
, O
luxury O
, O
ambition O
, O
and O
envy O
of O
the B-PER
upper I-PER
part I-PER
of I-PER
mankind I-PER
. O
He O
told O
me O
I O
might O
judge O
of O
the O
happiness O
of O
this O
state O
by O
this O
one O
thing O
— O
viz O
. O
that O
this O
was O
the O
state O
of O
life O
which O
all B-PER
other I-PER
people I-PER
envied O
; O
that O
kings B-PER
have O
frequently O
lamented O
the O
miserable O
consequence O
of O
being O
born O
to O
great O
things O
, O
and O
wished O
they O
had O
been O
placed O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
two O
extremes O
, O
between O
the O
mean O
and O
the O
great O
; O
that O
the B-PER
wise I-PER
man I-PER
gave O
his O
testimony O
to O
this O
, O
as O
the O
standard O
of O
felicity O
, O
when O
he O
prayed O
to O
have O
neither O
poverty O
nor O
riches O
. O
He O
bade O
me O
observe O
it O
, O
and O
I O
should O
always O
find O
that O
the O
calamities O
of O
life O
were O
shared O
among O
the B-PER
upper I-PER
and I-PER
lower I-PER
part I-PER
of I-PER
mankind I-PER
, O
but O
that O
the B-PER
middle I-PER
station I-PER
had O
the O
fewest O
disasters O
, O
and O
was O
not O
exposed O
to O
so O
many O
vicissitudes O
as O
the B-PER
higher I-PER
or I-PER
lower I-PER
part I-PER
of I-PER
mankind I-PER
; O
nay O
, O
they O
were O
not O
subjected O
to O
so O
many O
distempers O
and O
uneasinesses O
, O
either O
of O
body O
or O
mind O
, O
as O
those B-PER
were I-PER
who I-PER
, I-PER
by I-PER
vicious I-PER
living I-PER

luxury I-PER

and I-PER
extravagances I-PER
on I-PER

on I-PER
the I-PER

, O
bring O
distemper O
upon O
themselves O
by O
the O
natural O
consequences O
of O
their O
way O
of O
living O
; O
that O
the O
middle O
station O
of O
life O
was O
calculated O
for O
all O
kind O
of O
virtue O
and O
all O
kind O
of O
enjoyments O
; O
that O
peace O
and O
plenty O
were O
the O
handmaids O
of O
a O
middle O
fortune O
; O
that O
temperance O
, O
moderation O
, O
quietness O
, O
health O
, O
society O
, O
all O
agreeable O

, O
and O
all O
desirable O
pleasures O

were O
the O
blessings O
attending O
the O
middle O
station O
of O
life O
; O
that O
this O
way O
men B-PER
went O
silently O
and O
smoothly O
through O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
and O
comfortably O
out O
of O
it O
, O
not O
embarrassed O
with O
the O
labours O
of O
the O
hands O
or O
of O
the O
head O
, O
not O
sold O
to O
a O
life O
of O
slavery O
for O
daily O
bread O
, O
nor O
harassed O
with O
perplexed O
circumstances O
, O
which O
rob O
the O
soul O
of O
peace O
and O
the O
body O
of O
rest O
, O
nor O
enraged O
with O
the O
passion O
of O
envy O
, O
or O
the O
secret O
burning O
lust O
of O
ambition O
for O
great O
things O
; O
but O
, O
in O
easy O
circumstances O
, O
sliding O
gently O
through O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
and O
sensibly O
tasting O
the B-PER
sweets I-PER
of I-PER
living I-PER

without O
the O

; O
feeling O
that O

happy O

learning O
by O
every O

experience O
to O
know O
it O
more O
sensibly O

After O
this O
he O
pressed O
me O
earnestly O
, O
and O
in O
the O
most O
affectionate O
manner O
, O
not O
to O
play O
the B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
, O
nor O
to O
precipitate O
myself O
into O
miseries O
which O
nature O
, O
and O
the O
station O
of O
life O
I O
was O
born O
in O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
provided O
against O
; O
that O
I O
was O
under O
no O
necessity O
of O
seeking O
my O
bread O
; O
that O
he O
would O
do O
well O
for O
me O
, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
enter O
me O
fairly O
into O
the O
station O
of O
life O
which O
he O
had O
just O
been O
recommending O
to O
me O
; O
and O
that O
if O
I O
was O
not O
very O
easy O
and O
happy O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
it O
must O
be O
my O
mere O
fate O
or O
fault O
that O
must O
hinder O
it O
; O
and O
that O
he O
should O
have O
nothing O
to O
answer O
for O
, O
having O
thus O
discharged O
his O
duty O
in O
warning O
me O
against O
measures O
which O
he O
knew O
would O
be O
to O
my O
hurt O
; O
in O
a O
word O
, O
that O
as O
he O
would O
do O
very O
kind O
things O
for O
me O
if O
I O
would O
stay O
and O
settle O
at O
home B-FAC
as O
he O
directed O
, O
so O
he O
would O
not O
have O
so O
much O
hand O
in O
my O
misfortunes O
as O
to O
give O
me O
any O
encouragement O
to O
go O
away O
; O
and O
to O
close O
all O
, O
he O
told O
me O
I O
had O
my B-PER
elder I-PER
brother I-PER
for I-PER
an I-PER
example I-PER
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
used O
the O
same O
earnest O
persuasions O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
going O
into O
the B-LOC
Low I-LOC
Country I-LOC
wars O
, O
but O
could O
not O
prevail O
, O
his O
young O
desires O
prompting O
him O
to O
run O
into O
the O
army O
, O
where O
he O
was O
killed O
; O
and O
though O
he O
said O
he O
would O
not O
cease O
to O
pray O
for O
me O
, O
yet O
he O
would O
venture O
to O
say O
to O
me O
, O
that O
if O
I O
did O
take O
this O
foolish O
step O
, O
God B-PER
would O
not O
bless O
me O
, O
and O
I O
should O
have O
leisure O
hereafter O
to O
reflect O
upon O
having O
neglected O
his O
counsel O
when O
there O
might O
be O
none O
to O
assist O
in O
my O
recovery O
. O
I O
observed O
in O
this O
last O
part O
of O
his O
discourse O
, O
which O
was O
truly O
prophetic O
, O
though O
I O
suppose O
my B-PER
father I-PER
did O
not O
know O
it O
to O
be O
so O
himself O
— O
I O
say O
, O
I O
observed O
the O
tears O
run O
down O
his O
face O
very O
plentifully O
, O
especially O
when O
he O
spoke O
of O
my B-PER
brother I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
killed I-PER
: O
and O
that O
when O
he O
spoke O
of O
my O
having O
leisure O
to O
repent O
, O
and O
none O
to O
assist O
me O
, O
he O
was O
so O
moved O
that O
he O
broke O
off O
the O
discourse O
, O
and O
told O
me O
his O
heart O
was O
so O
full O
he O
could O
say O
no O
more O
to O
me O
. O
I O
was O
sincerely O
affected O
with O
this O
discourse O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
who O
could O
be O
otherwise O
? O
and O
I O
resolved O
not O
to O
think O
of O
going O
abroad O
any O
more O
, O
but O
to O
settle O
at O
home B-FAC
according O
to O
my B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
desire O
. O
But O
alas O
! O
a O
few O
days O
wore O
it O
all O
off O
; O
and O
, O
in O
short O
, O
to O
prevent O
any O
of O
my B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
further O
importunities O
, O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
after O
I O
resolved O
to O
run O
quite O
away O
from O
him O
. O
However O
, O
I O
did O
not O
act O
quite O
so O
hastily O
as O
the O
first O
heat O
of O
my O
resolution O
prompted O
; O
but O
I O
took O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
at O
a O
time O
when O
I O
thought O
her O
a O
little O
more O
pleasant O
than O
ordinary O
, O
and O
told O
her O
that O
my O
thoughts O
were O
so O
entirely O
bent O
upon O
seeing O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
that O
I O
should O
never O
settle O
to O
anything O
with O
resolution O
enough O
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
, O
and O
my B-PER
father I-PER
had O
better O
give O
me O
his O
consent O
than O
force O
me O
to O
go O
without O
it O
; O
that O
I O
was O
now O
eighteen O
years O
old O
, O
which O
was O
too O
late O
to O
go O
apprentice O
to O
a O
trade O
or O
clerk O
to O
an B-PER
attorney I-PER
; O
that O
I O
was O
sure O
if O
I O
did O
I O
should O
never O
serve O
out O
my O
time O
, O
but O
I O
should O
certainly O
run O
away O
from O
my B-PER
master I-PER
before O
my O
time O
was O
out O
, O
and O
go O
to O
sea B-LOC
; O
and O
if O
she O
would O
speak O
to O
my B-PER
father I-PER
to O
let O
me O
go O
one O
voyage O
abroad O
, O
if O
I O
came O
home B-FAC
again O
, O
and O
did O
not O
like O
it O
, O
I O
would O
go O
no O
more O
; O
and O
I O
would O
promise O
, O
by O
a O
double O
diligence O
, O
to O
recover O
the O
time O
that O
I O
had O
lost O
. O
This O
put O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
into O
a O
great O
passion O
; O
she O
told O
me O
she O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
to O
no O
purpose O
to O
speak O
to O
my B-PER
father I-PER
upon O
any O
such O
subject O
; O
that O
he O
knew O
too O
well O
what O
was O
my O
interest O
to O
give O
his O
consent O
to O
anything O
so O
much O
for O
my O
hurt O
; O
and O
that O
she O
wondered O
how O
I O
could O
think O
of O
any O
such O
thing O
after O
the O
discourse O
I O
had O
had O
with O
my B-PER
father I-PER
, O
and O
such O
kind O
and O
tender O
expressions O
as O
she O
knew O
my B-PER
father I-PER
had O
used O
to O
me O
; O
and O
that O
, O
in O
short O
, O
if O
I O
would O
ruin O
myself O
, O
there O
was O
no O
help O
for O
me O
; O
but O
I O
might O
depend O
I O
should O
never O
have O
their O
consent O
to O
it O
; O
that O
for O
her O
part O
she O
would O
not O
have O
so O
much O
hand O
in O
my O
destruction O
; O
and O
I O
should O
never O
have O
it O
to O
say O
that O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
willing O
when O
my B-PER
father I-PER
was O
not O
. O
Though O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
refused O
to O
move O
it O
to O
my B-PER
father I-PER
, O
yet O
I O
heard O
afterwards O
that O
she O
reported O
all O
the O
discourse O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
my B-PER
father I-PER
, O
after O
showing O
a O
great O
concern O
at O
it O
, O
said O
to O
her O
, O
with O
a O
sigh O
, O
“ O
That B-PER
boy I-PER
might O
be O
happy O
if O
he O
would O
stay O
at O
home B-FAC
; O
but O
if O
he O
goes O
abroad O
, O
he O
will O
be O
the B-PER
most I-PER
miserable I-PER
wretch I-PER
that I-PER
ever I-PER
was I-PER
born I-PER
: O
I O
can O
give O
no O
consent O
to O
it O
. O
” O
It O
was O
not O
till O
almost O
a O
year O
after O
this O
that O
I O
broke O
loose O
, O
though O
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
continued O
obstinately O
deaf O
to O
all O
proposals O
of O
settling O
to O
business O
, O
and O
frequently O
expostulated O
with O
my B-PER
father I-PER
and O
mother B-PER
about O
their O
being O
so O
positively O
determined O
against O
what O
they O
knew O
my O
inclinations O
prompted O
me O
to O
. O
But O
being O
one O
day O
at O
Hull B-GPE
, O
where O
I O
went O
casually O
, O
and O
without O
any O
purpose O
of O
making O
an O
elopement O
at O
that O
time O
; O
but O
, O
I O
say O
, O
being O
there B-GPE
, O
and O
one O
of O
my O
companions O
being O
about O
to O
sail O
to O
London B-GPE
in O
his B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
ship O
, O
and O
prompting O
me O
to O
go O
with O
them O
with O
the O
common O
allurement O
of O
seafaring B-PER
men I-PER
, O
that O
it O
should O
cost O
me O
nothing O
for O
my O
passage O
, O
I O
consulted O
neither O
father B-PER
nor O
mother B-PER
any O
more O
, O
nor O
so O
much O
as O
sent O
them O
word O
of O
it O
; O

leaving O
them O
to O
hear O
of O
it O
as O
they O
might O
, O
without O
asking O
God B-PER

blessing O

my O

without O

an O
ill O
hour O
, O
God B-PER

on O
the O
1st O
of O
September O
1651 O
, O
I O
went O
on O
board O
a O

for O
London B-GPE

Never O
any B-PER
young I-PER
adventurer I-PER

I O
believe O

mine O

The B-VEH

was O
no O
sooner O
out O
of O
the B-LOC
Humber I-LOC

the O
wind O
began O
to O
blow O
and O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
to O
rise O
in O
a O
most O
frightful O
manner O
; O
and O
, O
as O
I O
had O
never O
been O
at O
sea B-LOC
before O
, O
I O
was O
most O
inexpressibly O
sick O
in O
body O

terrified O
in O
mind O

I O
began O
now O
seriously O
to O
reflect O
upon O
what O
I O
had O
done O

and O
how O
justly O
I O
was O
overtaken O
by O
the O
judgment O
of O
Heaven B-FAC

my O
wicked O
leaving O
my B-PER

my B-PER

my B-PER

now O
fresh O
into O
my O

my O
conscience O

which O
was O
not O

come O
to O
the O
pitch O

hardness O

which O
it O

reproached O
me O

the O
contempt O

the O

my O

The B-FAC

summer O
wind O
stirred O
amidst O
the O
trees O
of O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
there O
came O
through O
the O
open O
door O
the O
heavy O
scent O
of O
the O
lilac O
, O
or O
the O
more O
delicate O
perfume O
of O
the O
pink-flowering O
thorn O
. O
From O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
divan O
of O
Persian O
saddle-bags O
on O
which O
he O
was O
lying O
, O
smoking O
, O
as O
was O
his O
custom O
, O
innumerable O
cigarettes O
, O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
Wotton O
could O
just O
catch O
the O
gleam O
of O
the O
honey-sweet O
and O
honey-coloured O
blossoms O
of O
a O
laburnum O
, O
whose O
tremulous O
branches O
seemed O
hardly O
able O
to O
bear O
the O
burden O
of O
a O
beauty O
so O
flamelike O
as O
theirs O
; O
and O
now O
and O
then O
the O
fantastic O
shadows O
of O
birds O
in O
flight O
flitted O
across O
the O
long O
tussore-silk O
curtains O
that O
were O
stretched O
in O
front O
of O
the O
huge O
window O
, O
producing O
a O
kind O
of O
momentary O
Japanese O
effect O
, O
and O
making O
him O
think O
of O
those O
pallid O
, O
jade-faced O
painters O
of O
Tokyo B-GPE
who O
, O
through O
the O
medium O
of O
an O
art O
that O
is O
necessarily O
immobile O
, O
seek O
to O
convey O
the O
sense O
of O
swiftness O
and O
motion O
. O
The O
sullen O
murmur O
of O
the O
bees O
shouldering O
their O
way O
through O
the O
long O
unmown O
grass O
, O
or O
circling O
with O
monotonous O
insistence O
round O
the O
dusty O
gilt O
horns O
of O
the O
straggling O
woodbine O
, O
seemed O
to O
make O
the O
stillness O
more O
oppressive O
. O
The O
dim O
roar O
of O
London B-GPE
was O
like O
the O
bourdon O
note O
of O
a O
distant O
organ O
. O
In O
the O
centre O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
clamped O
to O
an O
upright O
easel O
, O
stood O
the O
full-length O
portrait O
of O
a B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
extraordinary I-PER
personal I-PER
beauty I-PER
, O
and O
in O
front O
of O
it O
, O
some O
little O
distance O
away O
, O
was O
sitting O
the B-PER
artist I-PER
himself I-PER
, O
Basil B-PER
Hallward I-PER
, O
whose O
sudden O
disappearance O
some O
years O
ago O
caused O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
such O
public O
excitement O
and O
gave O
rise O
to O
so O
many O
strange O
conjectures O
. O
As O
the B-PER
painter I-PER
looked O
at O
the O
gracious O
and O
comely O
form O
he O
had O
so O
skilfully O
mirrored O
in O
his O
art O
, O
a O
smile O
of O
pleasure O
passed O
across O
his O
face O
, O
and O
seemed O
about O
to O
linger O
there O
. O
But O
he O
suddenly O
started O
up O
, O
and O
closing O
his O
eyes O
, O
placed O
his O
fingers O
upon O
the O
lids O
, O
as O
though O
he O
sought O
to O
imprison O
within O
his O
brain O
some O
curious O
dream O
from O
which O
he O
feared O
he O
might O
awake O
. O
" O
It O
is O
your O
best O
work O
, O
Basil B-PER
, O
the O
best O
thing O
you O
have O
ever O
done O
, O
" O
said O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
languidly O
. O
" O
You O
must O
certainly O
send O
it O
next O
year O
to O
the B-FAC
Grosvenor I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
Academy I-FAC
is O
too O
large O
and O
too O
vulgar O
. O
Whenever O
I O
have O
gone O
there B-FAC
, O
there O
have O
been O
either O
so B-PER
many I-PER
people I-PER
that O
I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
see O
the O
pictures O
, O
which O
was O
dreadful O
, O
or O
so O
many O
pictures O
that O
I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
see O
the B-PER
people I-PER
, O
which O
was O
worse O
. O
The B-FAC
Grosvenor I-FAC
is O
really O
the B-FAC
only I-FAC
place I-FAC
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
shall O
send O
it O
anywhere O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
tossing O
his O
head O
back O
in O
that O
odd O
way O
that O
used O
to O
make O
his B-PER
friends I-PER
laugh O
at O
him O
at O
Oxford B-FAC
. O
" O
No O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
send O
it O
anywhere O
. O
" O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
elevated O
his O
eyebrows O
and O
looked O
at O
him O
in O
amazement O
through O
the O
thin O
blue O
wreaths O
of O
smoke O
that O
curled O
up O
in O
such O
fanciful O
whorls O
from O
his O
heavy O
, O
opium-tainted O
cigarette O
. O
" O
Not O
send O
it O
anywhere O
? O
My B-PER
dear I-PER
fellow I-PER
, O
why O
? O
Have O
you O
any O
reason O
? O
What B-PER
odd I-PER
chaps I-PER
you B-PER
painters I-PER
are O
! O
You O
do O
anything O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
to O
gain O
a O
reputation O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
you O
have O
one O
, O
you O
seem O
to O
want O
to O
throw O
it O
away O
. O
It O
is O
silly O
of O
you O
, O
for O
there O
is O
only O
one O
thing O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
worse O
than O
being O
talked O
about O
, O
and O
that O
is O
not O
being O
talked O
about O
. O
A O
portrait O
like O
this O
would O
set O
you O
far O
above O
all O
the O
young O
men O
in O
England B-GPE
, O
and O
make O
the B-PER
old I-PER
men I-PER
quite O
jealous O
, O
if O
old B-PER
men I-PER
are O
ever O
capable O
of O
any O
emotion O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
you O
will O
laugh O
at O
me O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
but O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O
exhibit O
it O
. O
I O
have O
put O
too O
much O
of O
myself O
into O
it O
. O
" O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
stretched O
himself O
out O
on O
the O
divan O
and O
laughed O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
knew O
you O
would O
; O
but O
it O
is O
quite O
true O
, O
all O
the O

" O
" O
Too O
much O
of O
yourself O
in O
it O
! O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Basil B-PER
, O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
you O
were O
so O
vain O
; O
and O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O
see O
any O
resemblance O
between O
you O
, O
with O
your O
rugged O
strong O
face O
and O
your O
coal-black O
hair O
, O
and O
this B-PER
young I-PER
Adonis I-PER
, O
who O
looks O
as O
if O
he O
was O
made O
out O
of O
ivory O
and O
rose-leaves O
. O
Why O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
Basil B-PER
, O
he O
is O
a B-PER
Narcissus I-PER
, O
and O
you O
-- O
well O
, O
of O
course O
you O
have O
an O
intellectual O
expression O
and O
all O
that O
. O
But O
beauty O
, O
real O
beauty O
, O
ends O
where O
an O
intellectual O
expression O
begins O
. O
Intellect O
is O
in O
itself O
a O
mode O
of O
exaggeration O
, O
and O
destroys O
the O
harmony O
of O
any O
face O
. O
The O
moment O
one O
sits O
down O
to O
think O
, O
one O
becomes O
all O
nose O
, O
or O
all O
forehead O
, O
or O
something O
horrid O
. O
Look O
at O
the B-PER
successful I-PER
men I-PER
in O
any O
of O
the O
learned O
professions O
. O
How O
perfectly O
hideous O
they O
are O
! O
Except O
, O
of O
course O
, O
in O
the B-ORG
Church I-ORG
. O
But O
then O
in O
the B-ORG
Church I-ORG
they O
do O
n't O
think O
. O
A B-PER
bishop I-PER
keeps O
on O
saying O
at O
the O
age O
of O
eighty O
what O
he O
was O
told O
to O
say O
when O
he O
was O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
of I-PER
eighteen I-PER
, O
and O
as O
a O
natural O
consequence O
he O
always O
looks O
absolutely O
delightful O
. O
Your B-PER
mysterious I-PER
young I-PER
friend I-PER
, I-PER
whose I-PER
name I-PER
you I-PER
have I-PER
never I-PER
told I-PER
me I-PER
, I-PER
but I-PER
whose I-PER
picture I-PER
really I-PER
fascinates I-PER
me I-PER
, O
never O
thinks O

I O
feel O
quite O
sure O
of O
that O

He O
is O
some B-PER
brainless I-PER
beautiful I-PER
creature I-PER
who I-PER
should I-PER
be I-PER
always I-PER
here I-PER
in I-PER
winter I-PER
when I-PER
we I-PER
have I-PER
no I-PER

always I-PER
here I-PER

something I-PER

flatter O
yourself O

Basil B-PER
: O
you O
are O
not O

like O
him O

" O
" O
You O
do O

understand O
me O
, O
Harry B-PER

" O
answered O
the B-PER
artist I-PER

" O
Of O
course O
I O
am O
not O
like O
him O

I O
know O
that O
perfectly O
well O

Indeed O
, O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
to O
look O
like O
him O
. O
You O
shrug O
your O
shoulders O
? O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
the O
truth O
. O
There O
is O
a O
fatality O
about O
all O
physical O
and O
intellectual O
distinction O
, O
the O
sort O
of O
fatality O
that O
seems O
to O
dog O
through O
history O
the O
faltering O
steps O
of O
kings O
. O
It O
is O
better O
not O
to O
be O
different O
from O
one B-PER
's I-PER
fellows I-PER
. O
The B-PER
ugly I-PER
and O
the B-PER
stupid I-PER
have O
the O
best O
of O
it O
in O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
They O
can O
sit O
at O
their O
ease O
and O
gape O
at O
the O
play O
. O
If O
they O
know O
nothing O
of O
victory O
, O
they O
are O
at O
least O
spared O
the O
knowledge O
of O
defeat O
. O
They O
live O
as O
we O
all O
should O
live O
-- O
undisturbed O
, O
indifferent O
, O
and O
without O
disquiet O
. O
They O
neither O
bring O
ruin O
upon O
others O

receive O
it O

all O

what O
the B-PER

terribly O

" O
" O
Dorian B-PER
Gray I-PER
? O
Is O
that O
his O
name O
? O
" O
asked O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
, O
walking O
across O
the B-FAC
studio I-FAC
towards O
Basil B-PER
Hallward I-PER
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
that O
is O
his O
name O

I O
did O

intend O
to O
tell O
it O
to O
you O

" O
" O
But O
why O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
explain O
. O
When O
I O
like O
people B-PER
immensely O
, O
I O
never O
tell O
their O
names O
to O
any B-PER
one I-PER
. O
It O
is O
like O
surrendering O
a O
part O
of O
them O
. O
I O
have O
grown O
to O
love O
secrecy O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
one O
thing O
that O
can O
make O
modern O
life O
mysterious O
or O
marvellous O
to O
us O
. O
The O
commonest O
thing O
is O
delightful O
if O
one O
only O
hides O
it O
. O
When O
I O
leave O
town B-GPE
now O
I O
never O
tell O
my B-PER
people I-PER
where O
I O
am O
going O
. O
If O
I O
did O
, O
I O
would O
lose O
all O
my O
pleasure O

It O
is O
a O
silly O
habit O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
but O
somehow O
it O
seems O
to O
bring O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
romance O
into O
one O
's O
life O
. O
I O
suppose O
you O
think O
me O
awfully O
foolish O
about O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
at O
all O
, O
" O
answered O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
, O
" O
not O
at O
all O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
Basil B-PER
. O
You O
seem O
to O
forget O
that O
I O
am O
married O
, O
and O
the O
one O
charm O
of O
marriage O
is O
that O
it O
makes O
a O
life O
of O
deception O
absolutely O
necessary O
for O
both O
parties O
. O
I O
never O
know O
where O
my B-PER
wife I-PER
is O
, O
and O
my B-PER
wife I-PER
never O
knows O
what O
I O
am O
doing O

When O
we O

we O
do O
meet O
occasionally O

when O
we O
dine O
out O
together O
, O
or O
go O
down O
to O
the B-PER
Duke I-PER

-- O
we O
tell O
each O
other O
the O
most O
absurd O
stories O
with O
the O
most O
serious O
faces O

My B-PER
wife I-PER
is O
very O
good O
at O
it O
-- O
much O
better O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
than O
I O
am O
. O
She O
never O
gets O
confused O
over O
her O
dates O
, O
and O
I O
always O
do O
. O
But O
when O
she O
does O
find O
me O
out O
, O
she O
makes O
no O
row O
at O
all O
. O
I O
sometimes O
wish O
she O
would O
; O
but O
she O
merely O
laughs O
at O
me O
. O
" O
" O
I O
hate O
the O
way O
you O
talk O
about O
your O
married O
life O
, O
Harry B-PER
, O
" O
said O
Basil B-PER
Hallward I-PER
, O
strolling O
towards O
the O
door O
that O
led O
into O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC

" O
I O
believe O
that O
you O
are O
really O
a B-PER
very I-PER
good I-PER
husband I-PER

but O
that O
you O
are O
thoroughly O
ashamed O
of O
your O
own O
virtues O

You O
are O
an B-PER
extraordinary I-PER
fellow I-PER

You O
never O
say O
a O
moral O
thing O
, O
and O
you O
never O
do O
a O
wrong O
thing O

Your O
cynicism O
is O
simply O
a O
pose O

" O
" O
Being O
natural O
is O
simply O
a O
pose O

and O
the O
most O
irritating O
pose O
I O
know O

" O
cried O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
, O
laughing O
; O
and O
the B-PER
two I-PER
young I-PER
men I-PER
went O
out O
into O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
together O
and O
ensconced O
themselves O
on O
a O
long O
bamboo O
seat O
that O
stood O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
a O
tall O
laurel O
bush O
. O
The O
sunlight O
slipped O
over O
the O
polished O
leaves O
. O
In O
the O
grass O
, O
white O
daisies O
were O
tremulous O
. O
After O
a O
pause O
, O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
pulled O
out O
his O
watch O

" O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
must O
be O
going O

Basil B-PER
, O
" O
he O
murmured O
, O
" O
and O
before O
I O
go O
, O
I O
insist O
on O
your O
answering O
a O
question O
I O
put O
to O
you O
some O
time O

What O

said O
the B-PER
painter I-PER

I O
will O

why O
you O

the O
real O

" O
" O
No O
, O
you O
did O
not O

You O
said O
it O
was O
because O
there O
was O
too O
much O
of O
yourself O
in O
it O

Now O
, O
that O
is O
childish O

" O
" O
Harry B-PER

" O
said O
Basil B-PER
Hallward I-PER

looking O
him O
straight O
in O
the O
face O

every O

The B-PER

is O
revealed O
by O
the B-PER
painter I-PER
; O
it O
is O
rather O
the B-PER
painter I-PER
who I-PER
, I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
coloured I-PER
canvas I-PER
, I-PER
reveals I-PER
himself I-PER
. O
The O
reason O
I O
will O
not O
exhibit O
this O
picture O
is O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
I O
have O
shown O
in O
it O
the O
secret O
of O
my O
own O
soul O

" O
Lord B-PER
Henry O
laughed O

" O
And O
what O
is O
that O
? O
" O
he O
asked O

" O
I O
will O
tell O
you O

said O
Hallward B-PER

an O
expression O

came O
over O
his O
face O

CHAPTER O
I O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
, O
going O
out O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
left O
his B-FAC
shop I-FAC
nominally O
in O
charge O
of O
his B-PER
brother-in-law I-PER
. O
It O
could O
be O
done O
, O
because O
there O
was O
very O
little O
business O
at O
any O
time O
, O
and O
practically O
none O
at O
all O
before O
the O
evening O
. O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
cared O
but O
little O
about O
his O
ostensible O
business O
. O
And O
, O
moreover O
, O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
was O
in O
charge O
of O
his B-PER
brother-in-law I-PER
. O
The B-FAC
shop I-FAC
was O
small O
, O
and O
so O
was O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
It O
was O
one B-FAC
of I-FAC
those I-FAC
grimy I-FAC
brick I-FAC
houses I-FAC
which O
existed O
in O
large O
quantities O
before O
the O
era O
of O
reconstruction O
dawned O
upon O
London B-GPE
. O
The B-FAC
shop I-FAC
was O
a B-FAC
square I-FAC
box I-FAC
of I-FAC
a I-FAC
place I-FAC
, O
with O
the O
front O
glazed O
in O
small O
panes O
. O
In O
the O
daytime O
the O
door O
remained O
closed O
; O
in O
the O
evening O
it O
stood O
discreetly O
but O
suspiciously O
ajar O
. O
The O
window O
contained O
photographs O
of O
more B-PER
or I-PER
less I-PER
undressed I-PER
dancing I-PER
girls I-PER
; O
nondescript O
packages O
in O
wrappers O
like O
patent O
medicines O
; O
closed O
yellow O
paper O
envelopes O
, O
very O
flimsy O
, O
and O
marked O
two-and-six O
in O
heavy O
black O
figures O
; O
a O
few O
numbers O
of O
ancient O
French O
comic O
publications O
hung O
across O
a O
string O
as O
if O
to O
dry O
; O
a O
dingy O
blue O
china O
bowl O
, O
a O
casket O
of O
black O
wood O
, O
bottles O
of O
marking O
ink O
, O
and O
rubber O
stamps O
; O
a O
few O
books O
, O
with O
titles O
hinting O
at O
impropriety O
; O
a O
few O
apparently O
old O
copies O
of O
obscure O
newspapers O
, O
badly O
printed O
, O
with O
titles O
like O
_ O
The O
Torch O
_ O
, O
_ O
The O
Gong O
_ O
— O
rousing O
titles O
. O
And O
the O
two O
gas O
jets O
inside O
the O
panes O
were O
always O
turned O
low O
, O
either O
for O
economy O
’s O
sake O
or O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the B-PER
customers I-PER
. O
These B-PER
customers I-PER
were O
either O
very B-PER
young I-PER
men I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
hung I-PER
about I-PER
the I-PER
window I-PER
for I-PER
a I-PER
time I-PER
before I-PER
slipping I-PER
in I-PER
suddenly I-PER
; O
or O
men B-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
more I-PER
mature I-PER
age I-PER
, O
but O
looking O
generally O
as O
if O
they O
were O
not O
in O
funds O
. O
Some B-PER
of I-PER
that I-PER
last I-PER
kind I-PER
had O
the O
collars O
of O
their O
overcoats O
turned O
right O
up O
to O
their O
moustaches O
, O
and O
traces O
of O
mud O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
their O
nether O
garments O
, O
which O
had O
the O
appearance O
of O
being O
much O
worn O
and O
not O
very O
valuable O
. O
And O
the O
legs O
inside O
them O
did O
not O
, O
as O
a O
general O
rule O
, O
seem O
of O
much O
account O
either O
. O
With O
their O
hands O
plunged O
deep O
in O
the O
side O
pockets O
of O
their O
coats O
, O
they O
dodged O
in O
sideways O
, O
one O
shoulder O
first O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
to O
start O
the O
bell O
going O
. O
The O
bell O
, O
hung O
on O
the O
door O
by O
means O
of O
a O
curved O
ribbon O
of O
steel O
, O
was O
difficult O
to O
circumvent O
. O
It O
was O
hopelessly O
cracked O
; O
but O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
at O
the O
slightest O
provocation O
, O
it O
clattered O
behind O
the B-PER
customer I-PER
with O
impudent O
virulence O
. O
It O
clattered O
; O
and O
at O
that O
signal O
, O
through O
the O
dusty O
glass O
door O
behind O
the O
painted O
deal O
counter O
, O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
would O
issue O
hastily O
from O
the B-FAC
parlour I-FAC
at O
the O
back O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
naturally O
heavy O
; O
he O
had O
an O
air O
of O
having O
wallowed O
, O
fully O
dressed O
, O
all O
day O
on O
an O
unmade O
bed O
. O
Another B-PER
man I-PER
would O
have O
felt O
such O
an O
appearance O
a O
distinct O
disadvantage O
. O
In O
a O
commercial O
transaction O
of O
the O
retail O
order O
much O
depends O
on O
the B-PER
seller I-PER
’s O
engaging O
and O
amiable O
aspect O
. O
But O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
knew O
his O
business O
, O
and O
remained O
undisturbed O
by O
any O
sort O
of O
æsthetic O
doubt O
about O
his O
appearance O
. O
With O
a O
firm O
, O
steady-eyed O
impudence O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
hold O
back O
the O
threat O
of O
some O
abominable O
menace O
, O
he O
would O
proceed O
to O
sell O
over O
the O
counter O
some O
object O
looking O
obviously O
and O
scandalously O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
which O
passed O
in O
the O
transaction O
: O
a O
small O
cardboard O
box O
with O
apparently O
nothing O
inside O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
or O
one O
of O
those O
carefully O
closed O
yellow O
flimsy O
envelopes O
, O
or O
a O
soiled O
volume O
in O
paper O
covers O
with O
a O
promising O
title O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
it O
happened O
that O
one O
of O
the O
faded O
, O
yellow B-PER
dancing I-PER
girls I-PER
would O
get O
sold O
to O
an B-PER
amateur I-PER
, O
as O
though O
she O
had O
been O
alive O
and O
young O
. O
Sometimes O
it O
was O
Mrs B-PER
Verloc O
who O
would O
appear O
at O
the O
call O
of O
the O
cracked O
bell O
. O
Winnie B-PER
Verloc I-PER
was O
a B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
full I-PER
bust I-PER
, I-PER
in I-PER
a I-PER
tight I-PER
bodice I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
with I-PER
broad I-PER
hips I-PER
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
very O
tidy O
. O
Steady-eyed O
like O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
, O
she O
preserved O
an O
air O
of O
unfathomable O
indifference O
behind O
the O
rampart O
of O
the O
counter O
. O
Then O
the B-PER
customer I-PER
of I-PER
comparatively I-PER
tender I-PER
years I-PER
would O
get O
suddenly O
disconcerted O
at O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
, O
and O
with O
rage O
in O
his O
heart O
would O
proffer O
a O
request O
for O
a O
bottle O
of O
marking O
ink O
, O
retail O
value O
sixpence O
( O
price O
in O
Verloc B-PER
’s O
shop O
one-and-sixpence O
) O
, O
which O
, O
once O
outside O
, O
he O
would O
drop O
stealthily O
into O
the O
gutter O
. O
The B-PER
evening I-PER
visitors I-PER
— O
the B-PER
men I-PER
with I-PER
collars I-PER
turned I-PER
up I-PER
and I-PER
soft I-PER
hats I-PER
rammed I-PER
down I-PER
— O
nodded O
familiarly O
to O
Mrs B-PER
Verloc O
, O
and O
with O
a O
muttered O
greeting O
, O
lifted O
up O
the O
flap O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
counter O
in O
order O
to O
pass O
into O
the B-FAC
back I-FAC
parlour I-FAC
, O
which O
gave O
access O
to O
a B-FAC
passage I-FAC
and O
to O
a B-FAC
steep I-FAC
flight I-FAC
of I-FAC
stairs I-FAC
. O
The O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
shop I-FAC
was O
the O
only O
means O
of O
entrance O
to O
the O
house O
in O
which O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
carried O
on O
his O
business O
of O
a B-PER
seller I-PER
of I-PER
shady I-PER
wares I-PER
, O
exercised O
his O
vocation O
of O
a B-PER
protector I-PER
of I-PER
society I-PER
, O
and O
cultivated O
his O
domestic O
virtues O
. O
These O
last O
were O
pronounced O
. O
He O
was O
thoroughly O
domesticated O
. O
Neither O
his O
spiritual O
, O
nor O
his O
mental O
, O
nor O
his O
physical O
needs O
were O
of O
the O
kind O
to O
take O
him O
much O
abroad O
. O
He O
found O
at O
home B-FAC
the O
ease O
of O
his O
body O
and O
the O
peace O
of O
his O
conscience O
, O
together O
with O
Mrs B-PER
Verloc O
’s O
wifely O
attentions O
and O
Mrs B-PER
Verloc O
’s O
mother O
’s O
deferential O
regard O
. O
Winnie B-PER
’s O
mother O
was O
a B-PER
stout I-PER
, I-PER
wheezy I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
with O
a O
large O
brown O
face O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
black O
wig O
under O
a O
white O
cap O
. O
Her O
swollen O
legs O
rendered O
her O
inactive O
. O
She O
considered O
herself O
to O
be O
of O
French O
descent O
, O
which O
might O
have O
been O
true O
; O
and O
after O
a O
good O
many O
years O
of O
married O
life O
with O
a B-PER
licensed I-PER
victualler I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
more I-PER
common I-PER
sort I-PER
, O
she O
provided O
for O
the O
years O
of O
widowhood O
by O
letting O
furnished O
apartments O
for O
gentlemen B-PER
near O
Vauxhall B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
Road I-FAC
in O
a B-FAC
square I-FAC
once O
of O
some O
splendour O
and O
still O
included O
in O
the B-GPE
district I-GPE
of I-GPE
Belgravia I-GPE
. O
This O
topographical O
fact O
was O
of O
some O
advantage O
in O
advertising O
her B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
; O
but O
the O
patrons O
of O
the B-PER
worthy I-PER
widow I-PER
were O
not O
exactly O
of O
the O
fashionable O
kind O
. O
Such O
as O
they O
were O
, O
her B-PER
daughter I-PER
Winnie B-PER
helped O
to O
look O
after O
them O
. O
Traces O
of O
the O
French O
descent O
which O
the B-PER
widow I-PER
boasted O
of O
were O
apparent O
in O
Winnie B-PER
too O
. O
They O
were O
apparent O
in O
the O
extremely O
neat O
and O
artistic O
arrangement O
of O
her O
glossy O
dark O
hair O
. O
Winnie B-PER
had O
also O
other O
charms O
: O
her O
youth O
; O
her O
full O
, O
rounded O
form O
; O
her O
clear O
complexion O
; O
the O
provocation O
of O
her O
unfathomable O
reserve O
, O
which O
never O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
prevent O
conversation O
, O
carried O
on O
on O
the B-PER
lodgers I-PER
’ O
part O
with O
animation O
, O
and O
on O
hers O
with O
an O
equable O
amiability O
. O
It O
must O
be O
that O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
was O
susceptible O
to O
these O
fascinations O
. O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
was O
an B-PER
intermittent I-PER
patron I-PER
. O
He O
came O
and O
went O
without O
any O
very O
apparent O
reason O
. O
He O
generally O
arrived O
in O
London B-GPE
( O
like O
the O
influenza O
) O
from O
the B-GPE
Continent I-GPE
, O
only O
he O
arrived O
unheralded O
by O
the O
Press O
; O
and O
his O
visitations O
set O
in O
with O
great O
severity O
. O
He O
breakfasted O
in O
bed O
, O
and O
remained O
wallowing O
there O
with O
an O
air O
of O
quiet O
enjoyment O
till O
noon O
every O
day O
— O
and O
sometimes O
even O
to O
a O
later O
hour O
. O
But O
when O
he O
went O
out O
he O
seemed O
to O
experience O
a O
great O
difficulty O
in O
finding O
his O
way O
back O
to O
his O
temporary O
home O
in O
the B-FAC
Belgravian I-FAC
square I-FAC
. O
He O
left O
it O
late O
, O
and O
returned O
to O
it O
early O
— O
as O
early O
as O
three O
or O
four O
in O
the O
morning O
; O
and O
on O
waking O
up O
at O
ten O
addressed O
Winnie B-PER
, O
bringing O
in O
the O
breakfast O
tray O
, O
with O
jocular O
, O
exhausted O
civility O
, O
in O
the O
hoarse O
, O
failing O
tones O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
been I-PER
talking I-PER
vehemently I-PER
for I-PER
many I-PER
hours I-PER
together I-PER
. O
His O
prominent O
, O
heavy-lidded O
eyes O
rolled O
sideways O
amorously O
and O
languidly O
, O
the O
bedclothes O
were O
pulled O
up O
to O
his O
chin O
, O
and O
his O
dark O
smooth O
moustache O
covered O
his O
thick O
lips O
capable O
of O
much O
honeyed O
banter O
. O
In O
Winnie B-PER
’s O
mother O
’s O
opinion O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
was O
a B-PER
very I-PER
nice I-PER
gentleman I-PER
. O
From O
her O
life O
’s O
experience O
gathered O
in O
various O
“ B-FAC
business I-FAC
houses I-FAC
” I-FAC
the B-PER
good I-PER
woman I-PER
had O
taken O
into O
her O
retirement O
an O
ideal O
of O
gentlemanliness O
as O
exhibited O
by O
the O
patrons O
of O
private-saloon B-FAC
bars I-FAC
. O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
approached O
that O
ideal O
; O
he O
attained O
it O
, O
in O
fact O
. O
“ O
Of O
course O
, O
we O
’ll O
take O
over O
your O
furniture O
, O
mother B-PER
, O
” O
Winnie B-PER
had O
remarked O
. O
The B-FAC
lodging-house I-FAC
was O
to O
be O
given O
up O
. O
It O
seems O
it O
would O
not O
answer O
to O
carry O
it O
on O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
too O
much O
trouble O
for O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
. O
It O
would O
not O
have O
been O
convenient O
for O
his O
other O
business O
. O
What O
his O
business O
was O
he O
did O
not O
say O
; O
but O
after O
his O
engagement O
to O
Winnie B-PER
he O
took O
the O
trouble O
to O
get O
up O
before O
noon O
, O
and O
descending O
the B-FAC
basement I-FAC
stairs I-FAC
, O
make O
himself O
pleasant O
to O
Winnie B-PER
’s O
mother O
in O
the B-FAC
breakfast-room I-FAC
downstairs B-FAC
where O
she O
had O
her O
motionless O
being O
. O
He O
stroked O
the O
cat O
, O
poked O
the O
fire O
, O
had O
his O
lunch O
served O
to O
him O
there B-FAC
. O
He O
left O
its O
slightly O
stuffy O
cosiness O
with O
evident O
reluctance O
, O
but O
, O
all O
the O
same O
, O
remained O
out O
till O
the O
night O
was O
far O
advanced O
. O
He O
never O
offered O
to O
take O
Winnie B-PER
to O
theatres B-FAC
, O
as O
such B-PER
a I-PER
nice I-PER
gentleman I-PER
ought O
to O
have O
done O
. O
His O
evenings O
were O
occupied O
. O
His O
work O
was O
in O
a O
way O
political O
, O
he O
told O
Winnie B-PER
once O
. O
She O
would O
have O
, O
he O
warned O
her O
, O
to O
be O
very O
nice O
to O
his B-PER
political I-PER
friends I-PER
. O
And O
with O
her O
straight O
, O
unfathomable O
glance O
she O
answered O
that O
she O
would O
be O
so O
, O
of O
course O
. O
How O
much O
more O
he O
told O
her O
as O
to O
his O
occupation O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
Winnie B-PER
’s O
mother O
to O
discover O
. O
The B-PER
married I-PER
couple I-PER
took O
her O
over O
with O
the O
furniture O
. O
The O
mean O
aspect O
of O
the B-FAC
shop I-FAC
surprised O
her O
. O
The O
change O
from O
the B-FAC
Belgravian I-FAC
square I-FAC
to O
the O
narrow O
street O
in O
Soho B-FAC
affected O
her O
legs O
adversely O
. O
They O
became O
of O
an O
enormous O
size O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
she O
experienced O
a O
complete O
relief O
from O
material O
cares O
. O
Her B-PER
son-in-law I-PER
’s O
heavy O
good O
nature O
inspired O
her O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
absolute O
safety O
. O
Her B-PER
daughter I-PER
’s O
future O
was O
obviously O
assured O
, O
and O
even O
as O
to O
her B-PER
son I-PER
Stevie B-PER
she O
need O
have O
no O
anxiety O
. O
She O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
conceal O
from O
herself O
that O
he O
was O
a O
terrible O
encumbrance O
, O
that B-PER
poor I-PER
Stevie I-PER
. O
But O
in O
view O
of O
Winnie B-PER
’s O
fondness O
for O
her B-PER
delicate I-PER
brother I-PER
, O
and O
of O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
’s O
kind O
and O
generous O
disposition O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
the B-PER
poor I-PER
boy I-PER
was O
pretty O
safe O
in O
this B-LOC
rough I-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
And O
in O
her O
heart O
of O
hearts O
she O
was O
not O
perhaps O
displeased O
that O
the B-PER
Verlocs I-PER
had O
no B-PER
children I-PER
. O
As O
that O
circumstance O
seemed O
perfectly O
indifferent O
to O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
, O
and O
as O
Winnie B-PER
found O
an O
object O
of O
quasi-maternal O
affection O
in O
her B-PER
brother I-PER
, O
perhaps O
this O
was O
just O
as O
well O
for O
poor O
Stevie B-PER
. O
For O
he O
was O
difficult O
to O
dispose O
of O
, O
that B-PER
boy I-PER
. O
He O
was O
delicate O
and O
, O
in O
a O
frail O
way O
, O
good-looking O
too O
, O
except O
for O
the O
vacant O
droop O
of O
his O
lower O
lip O
. O
Under O
our O
excellent O
system O
of O
compulsory O
education O
he O
had O
learned O
to O
read O
and O
write O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
unfavourable O
aspect O
of O
the O
lower O
lip O
. O
But O
as O
errand-boy B-PER
he O
did O
not O
turn O
out O
a O
great O
success O
. O
He O
forgot O
his O
messages O
; O
he O
was O
easily O
diverted O
from O
the O
straight O
path O
of O
duty O
by O
the O
attractions O
of O
stray O
cats O
and O
dogs O
, O
which O
he O
followed O
down O
narrow B-FAC
alleys I-FAC
into O
unsavoury B-FAC
courts I-FAC
; O
by O
the O
comedies O
of O
the B-FAC
streets I-FAC
, O
which O
he O
contemplated O
open-mouthed O
, O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
his B-PER
employer I-PER
’s O
interests O
; O
or O
by O
the O
dramas O
of O
fallen O
horses O
, O
whose O
pathos O
and O
violence O
induced O
him O
sometimes O
to O
shriek O
pierceingly O
in O
a O
crowd O
, O
which O
disliked O
to O
be O
disturbed O
by O
sounds O
of O
distress O
in O
its O
quiet O
enjoyment O
of O
the O
national O
spectacle O
. O
When O
led O
away O
by O
a B-PER
grave I-PER
and I-PER
protecting I-PER
policeman I-PER
, O
it O
would O
often O
become O
apparent O
that O
poor O
Stevie B-PER
had O
forgotten O
his O
address O
— O
at O
least O
for O
a O
time O
. O
A O
brusque O
question O
caused O
him O
to O
stutter O
to O
the O
point O
of O
suffocation O
. O
When O
startled O
by O
anything O
perplexing O
he O
used O
to O
squint O
horribly O
. O
However O
, O
he O
never O
had O
any O
fits O
( O
which O
was O
encouraging O
) O
; O
and O
before O
the O
natural O
outbursts O
of O
impatience O
on O
the O
part O
of O
his B-PER
father I-PER
he O
could O
always O
, O
in O
his O
childhood O
’s O
days O
, O
run O
for O
protection O
behind O
the O
short O
skirts O
of O
his B-PER
sister I-PER
Winnie B-PER
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
might O
have O
been O
suspected O
of O
hiding O
a O
fund O
of O
reckless O
naughtiness O
. O
When O
he O
had O
reached O
the O
age O
of O
fourteen O
a O
friend O
of O
his B-PER
late I-PER
father I-PER
, O
an O
agent O
for O
a B-ORG
foreign I-ORG
preserved I-ORG
milk I-ORG
firm I-ORG
, O
having O
given O
him O
an O
opening O
as O
office-boy B-PER
, O
he O
was O
discovered O
one O
foggy O
afternoon O
, O
in O
his B-PER
chief I-PER
’s O
absence O
, O
busy O
letting O
off O
fireworks O
on O
the B-FAC
staircase I-FAC
. O
He O
touched O
off O
in O
quick O
succession O
a O
set O
of O
fierce O
rockets O
, O
angry O
catherine O
wheels O
, O
loudly O
exploding O
squibs O
— O
and O
the O
matter O
might O
have O
turned O
out O
very O
serious O
. O
An O
awful O
panic O
spread O
through O
the B-FAC
whole I-FAC
building I-FAC
. O
Wild-eyed B-PER
, I-PER
choking I-PER
clerks I-PER
stampeded O
through O
the B-FAC
passages I-FAC
full O
of O
smoke O
, O
silk O
hats O
and O
elderly B-PER
business I-PER
men I-PER
could O
be O
seen O
rolling O
independently O
down O
the B-FAC
stairs I-FAC
. O
Stevie B-PER
did O
not O
seem O
to O
derive O
any O
personal O
gratification O
from O
what O
he O
had O
done O
. O
His O
motives O
for O
this O
stroke O
of O
originality O
were O
difficult O
to O
discover O
. O
It O
was O
only O
later O
on O
that O
Winnie B-PER
obtained O
from O
him O
a O
misty O
and O
confused O
confession O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
two O
other O
office-boys O
in O
the B-FAC
building I-FAC
had O
worked O
upon O
his O
feelings O
by O
tales O
of O
injustice O
and O
oppression O
till O
they O
had O
wrought O
his O
compassion O
to O
the O
pitch O
of O
that O
frenzy O
. O
But O
his B-PER
father I-PER
’s O
friend O
, O
of O
course O
, O
dismissed O
him O
summarily O
as O
likely O
to O
ruin O
his B-ORG
business I-ORG
. O
After O
that O
altruistic O
exploit O
Stevie B-PER
was O
put O
to O
help O
wash O
the O
dishes O
in O
the B-FAC
basement I-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
, O
and O
to O
black O
the O
boots O
of O
the O
gentlemen O
patronising O
the B-FAC
Belgravian I-FAC
mansion I-FAC
. O
There O
was O
obviously O
no O
future O
in O
such O
work O
. O
The B-PER
gentlemen I-PER
tipped O
him O
a O
shilling O
now O
and O
then O
. O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
showed O
himself O
the O
most O
generous O
of O
lodgers B-PER
. O
But O
altogether O
all O
that O
did O
not O
amount O
to O
much O
either O
in O
the O
way O
of O
gain O
or O
prospects O
; O
so O
that O
when O
Winnie B-PER
announced O
her O
engagement O
to O
Mr B-PER
Verloc O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
could O
not O
help O
wondering O
, O
with O
a O
sigh O
and O
a O
glance O
towards O
the O
scullery O
, O
what O
would O
become O
of O
poor B-PER
Stephen I-PER
now O

It O

such O

“ O

Holmes B-PER

sitting O

I O

no O

no O

me O

the B-PER

by O
an O
examination O
of O
it O

” O
“ O
I O
think O

said O
I O
, O
following O
as O
far O
as O
I O
could O
the O
methods O
of O
my B-PER

” O
“ O
Good O
! O

Holmes B-PER

“ O
Excellent O
! O
” O
“ O
I O
think O
also O
that O
the O
probability O
is O
in O
favour O
of O
his O
being O
a B-PER
country I-PER
practitioner I-PER
who I-PER
does I-PER
a I-PER
great I-PER
deal I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
visiting I-PER
on I-PER
foot I-PER

” O
“ O
Why O
so O
? O
” O
“ O
Because O
this O
stick O
, O
though O
originally O
a O
very O
handsome O
one O
has O
been O
so O
knocked O
about O
that O
I O
can O
hardly O
imagine O
a O
town B-GPE
practitioner O
carrying O
it O
. O
The O
thick-iron O
ferrule O
is O
worn O
down O
, O
so O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
he O
has O
done O
a O
great O
amount O
of O
walking O
with O
it O

“ O
Perfectly O

Holmes B-PER

“ O

then O
again O
, O

” O
“ O
Really O
, O
Watson B-PER
, O
you O
excel O
yourself O

said O
Holmes B-PER

pushing O
back O
his O
chair O

lighting O
a O
cigarette O

“ O
I O

of O

It O
may O
be O
that O
you O

you O

Some B-PER
people I-PER

power O

it O

I O
confess O
, O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
fellow I-PER
, O
that O
I O
am O
very O
much O
in O
your O
debt O

” O
He O
had O
never O
said O
as O
much O
before O
, O
and O
I O
must O
admit O
that O
his O
words O
gave O
me O
keen O
pleasure O
, O
for O
I O
had O
often O
been O
piqued O
by O
his O
indifference O
to O
my O
admiration O
and O
to O
the O
attempts O
which O
I O
had O
made O
to O
give O
publicity O
to O
his O
methods O
. O
I O
was O
proud O
, O
too O
, O
to O
think O
that O
I O
had O
so O
far O
mastered O
his O
system O
as O
to O
apply O
it O
in O
a O
way O
which O
earned O
his O
approval O
. O
He O
now O
took O
the O
stick O
from O
my O
hands O
and O
examined O
it O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
with O
his O
naked O
eyes O
. O
Then O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
interest O
he O
laid O
down O
his O
cigarette O
, O
and O
carrying O
the O
cane O
to O
the O
window O
, O
he O
looked O
over O
it O
again O
with O
a O
convex O
lens O
. O
“ O
Interesting O
, O
though O
elementary O
, O
” O
said O
he O
as O
he O
returned O
to O
his O
favourite O
corner O
of O
the O
settee O
. O
“ O
There O
are O
certainly O
one O
or O
two O
indications O
upon O
the O

gives O
us O
the O
basis O
for O
several O
deductions O

” O
“ O
Has O
anything O
escaped O
me O
? O
” O
I O
asked O
with O
some O
self-importance O

“ O
I O
trust O
that O

nothing O

“ O
I O
am O
afraid O

my B-PER

that O
most O
of O
your O
conclusions O

erroneous O

When O
I O
said O
that O
you O
stimulated O
me O
I O
meant O
, O
to O
be O
frank O

that O
in O
noting O
your O
fallacies O
I O
was O
occasionally O
guided O
towards O
the O
truth O

Not O
that O
you O
are O
entirely O
wrong O

The B-PER

I O

would O
suggest O

for O
example O

more O
likely O
to O

themselves O

if O
we O
take O
this O
as O
a O

we O
have O
a O
fresh O
basis O
from O

to O
start O
our O
construction O
of O
this B-PER

does O
stand O
for O
‘ O

what O

them O

“ O
I O
can O
only O
think O
of O
the O
obvious O
conclusion O
that O
the B-PER
man I-PER
has O
practised O
in O
town B-GPE
before O
going O
to O
the B-LOC

” O
“ O
I O
think O
that O
we O
might O
venture O
a O
little O
farther O
than O
this O

Look O
at O
it O
in O
this O
light O

On O
what O
occasion O
would O
it O
be O
most O
probable O
that O
such O
a O
presentation O
would O
be O
made O
? O
When O
would O
his B-PER
friends I-PER
unite O
to O
give O
him O
a O
pledge O
of O
their O
good O
will O
? O
Obviously O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
Dr. B-PER
Mortimer O
withdrew O
from O
the O
service O
of O
the B-ORG
hospital I-ORG
in O
order O
to O
start O
a O
practice O
for O
himself O

We O
know O
there O
has O
been O
a O
presentation O

We O
believe O
there O
has O
been O
a O
change O
from O
a O
town B-GPE
hospital O
to O
a O
country O
practice O

Is O
it O
, O
then O
, O
stretching O
our O
inference O
too O
far O
to O
say O
that O
the O
presentation O
was O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
change O
? O
” O
“ O
It O
certainly O
seems O
probable O

“ O
Now O

you O
will O
observe O

If O

could O
only O

The O
appearance O
of O
our B-PER

a O
surprise O
to O
me O
, O
since O
I O
had O
expected O
a B-PER
typical I-PER
country I-PER
practitioner I-PER

He O

a B-PER
very I-PER
tall I-PER

thin I-PER
man I-PER

with I-PER
a I-PER
long I-PER

jutted I-PER
out I-PER

sparkling I-PER
brightly I-PER
from I-PER
behind I-PER
a I-PER
pair I-PER
of I-PER
gold-rimmed I-PER
glasses I-PER

He O
was O
clad O
in O
a O
professional O

rather O
slovenly O
fashion O

for O
his O
frock-coat O
was O
dingy O

his O

frayed O

Though O
young O

his O
long O
back O
was O
already O
bowed O

he O
walked O
with O
a O
forward O
thrust O
of O
his O
head O

a O
general O
air O
of O
peering O
benevolence O

As O
he O
entered O

fell O
upon O
the O

ran O

an O
exclamation O

glad O

The B-PER
Rassendylls I-PER
-- O
With O
a O
Word O
on O
the B-PER
Elphbergs I-PER
“ O
I O
wonder O
when O
in O

you O
’re O
going O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
Rudolf B-PER

” O
said O
my B-PER
brother I-PER

wife O
. O
“ O
My B-PER
dear I-PER
Rose B-PER
, O
” O
I O
answered O
, O
laying O
down O
my O
egg-spoon O
, O
“ O
why O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
should O
I O
do O
anything O
? O
My O
position O
is O
a O
comfortable O
one O
. O
I O
have O
an O
income O
nearly O
sufficient O
for O
my O
wants O
( O
no B-PER
one I-PER
’s O
income O
is O
ever O
quite O
sufficient O
, O
you O
know O
) O
, O
I O
enjoy O
an O
enviable O
social O
position O
: O
I O
am O
brother O
to O
Lord B-PER
Burlesdon O
, O
and O
brother-in-law O
to O
that B-PER
charming I-PER
lady I-PER
, O
his B-PER
countess I-PER
. O
Behold O
, O
it O
is O
enough O
! O
” O
“ O
You O
are O
nine-and-twenty O
, O
” O
she O
observed O
, O
“ O
and O
you O
’ve O
done O
nothing O
but O
-- O
” O
“ O
Knock O
about O
? O
It O
is O
true O
. O
Our B-PER
family I-PER
does O
n’t O
need O
to O
do O
things O
. O
” O
This O
remark O
of O
mine O
rather O
annoyed O
Rose B-PER
, O
for O
everybody B-PER
knows O
( O
and O
therefore O
there O
can O
be O
no O
harm O
in O
referring O
to O
the O
fact O
) O
that O
, O
pretty O
and O
accomplished O
as O
she O
herself O
is O
, O
her B-PER
family I-PER
is O
hardly O
of O
the O
same O
standing O
as O
the B-PER
Rassendylls I-PER
. O
Besides O
her O
attractions O
, O
she O
possessed O
a O
large O
fortune O
, O
and O
my B-PER
brother I-PER
Robert B-PER
was O
wise O
enough O
not O
to O
mind O
about O
her O
ancestry O
. O
Ancestry O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
matter O
concerning O
which O
the O
next O
observation O
of O
Rose B-PER
’s O
has O
some O
truth O
. O
“ O
Good B-PER
families I-PER
are O
generally O
worse O
than O
any O
others O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
Upon O
this O
I O
stroked O
my O
hair O
: O
I O
knew O
quite O
well O
what O
she O
meant O
. O
“ O
I O
’m O
so O
glad O
Robert B-PER
’s O
is O
black O
! O
” O
she O
cried O
. O
At O
this O
moment O
Robert B-PER
( O
who O
rises O
at O
seven O
and O
works O
before O
breakfast O
) O
came O
in O
. O
He O
glanced O
at O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
: O
her O
cheek O
was O
slightly O
flushed O
; O
he O
patted O
it O
caressingly O
. O
“ O
What O
’s O
the O
matter O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
” O
he O
asked O
. O
“ O
She O
objects O
to O
my O
doing O
nothing O
and O
having O
red O
hair O
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
in O
an O
injured O
tone O
. O
“ O
Oh O
! O
of O
course O
he O
ca O
n’t O
help O
his O
hair O
, O
” O
admitted O
Rose B-PER
. O
“ O
It O
generally O
crops O
out O
once O
in O
a O
generation O
, O
” O
said O
my B-PER
brother I-PER
. O
“ O
So O
does O
the O
nose O

Rudolf B-PER
has O
got O
them O
both O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
wish O
they O
did O
n’t O
crop O
out O

” O
said O
Rose B-PER
, O
still O
flushed O
. O
“ O
I O
rather O
like O
them O
myself O
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
and O
, O
rising O
, O
I O
bowed O
to O
the O
portrait O
of O
Countess B-PER
Amelia O
. O
My B-PER
brother I-PER

wife O
uttered O
an O
exclamation O
of O
impatience O
. O
“ O
I O
wish O
you O
’d O
take O
that O
picture O
away O
, O
Robert B-PER

” O
said O
she O
. O
“ O
My O

” O
he O
cried O
. O
“ O
Good O
heavens O
! O
” O
I O
added O
. O
“ O
Then O
it O
might O
be O
forgotten O

” O
she O
continued O
. O
“ O
Hardly O
-- O
with O
Rudolf B-PER
about O

” O
said O
Robert B-PER
, O
shaking O
his O
head O

“ O
Why O
should O
it O

” O
I O
asked O

“ O

exclaimed O
my B-PER
brother I-PER

wife O
, O
blushing O
very O
prettily O
. O
I O
laughed O
, O
and O
went O
on O
with O
my O
egg O
. O
At O
least O
I O
had O
shelved O
the O
question O
of O
what O
( O
if O
anything O
) O
I O
ought O
to O
do O
. O
And O
, O
by O
way O
of O
closing O
the O
discussion O
-- O
and O
also O
, O
I O
must O
admit O
, O
of O
exasperating O
my B-PER
strict I-PER
little I-PER
sister-in-law I-PER
a O
trifle O
more O
-- O
I O
observed O
: O
“ O
I O
rather O
like O
being O
an B-PER
Elphberg I-PER
myself O
. O
” O
When O
I O
read O
a O
story O
, O
I O
skip O
the O
explanations O
; O
yet O
the O
moment O
I O
begin O
to O
write O
one O
, O
I O
find O
that O
I O
must O
have O
an O
explanation O
. O
For O
it O
is O
manifest O
that O
I O
must O
explain O
why O
my B-PER
sister-in-law I-PER
was O
vexed O
with O
my O
nose O
and O
hair O
, O
and O
why O
I O
ventured O
to O
call O
myself O
an B-PER
Elphberg I-PER
. O
For O
eminent O
as O
, O
I O
must O
protest O
, O
the B-PER
Rassendylls I-PER
have O
been O
for O
many O
generations O
, O
yet O
participation O
in O
their O
blood O
of O
course O
does O
not O
, O
at O
first O
sight O
, O
justify O
the O
boast O
of O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
grander O
stock O
of O
the B-PER
Elphbergs I-PER
or O
a O
claim O
to O
be O
one O
of O
that B-PER
Royal I-PER
House I-PER
. O
For O
what O
relationship O
is O
there O
between O
Ruritania B-GPE
and O
Burlesdon B-GPE
, O
between O
the O
Palace O
at O

Well O
then O
-- O
and O
I O
must O
premise O
that O
I O
am O
going O
, O
perforce O
, O
to O
rake O
up O
the O
very O
scandal O
which O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
Lady B-PER
Burlesdon O
wishes O
forgotten O

in O

year O
1733 O

King I-PER

the B-PER
Prince I-PER

Wales I-PER
being O
not O
yet O
at O

there O
came O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
the B-FAC

certain O
prince O

was O
afterwards O
known O

Third O
of O
Ruritania B-GPE

The B-PER
prince I-PER
was O
a B-PER
tall I-PER

handsome I-PER
young I-PER
fellow I-PER

marked I-PER
( I-PER
maybe I-PER
marred I-PER

it I-PER
is I-PER
not I-PER
for I-PER
me I-PER
to I-PER
say I-PER
) I-PER
by I-PER
a I-PER
somewhat I-PER
unusually I-PER
long I-PER

sharp I-PER

straight I-PER
nose I-PER

a I-PER
mass I-PER
of I-PER
dark-red I-PER
hair I-PER
-- O
in O

, O
the O
nose O
and O
the O
hair O
which O
have O
stamped O
the B-PER
Elphbergs I-PER
time O
out O
of O
mind O
. O
He O
stayed O
some O
months O
in O
England B-GPE

he I-GPE
was I-GPE
most I-GPE
courteously I-GPE

; O
yet O
, O
in O
the O
end O

he O
left O
rather O
under O
a O
cloud O

For O
he O
fought O
a O
duel O
( O
it O
was O
considered O
highly O

waive O
all O
question O

with O
a B-PER

well O
known O
in O

not O

for O

the O
husband O
of O
a B-PER
very I-PER
beautiful I-PER
wife I-PER
. O
In O
that O
duel O
Prince B-PER
Rudolf I-PER
received O
a O
severe O
wound O
, O
and O
, O
recovering O
therefrom O
, O
was O
adroitly O
smuggled O
off O
by O
the B-PER
Ruritanian I-PER
ambassador I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
found I-PER
him I-PER
a I-PER
pretty I-PER
handful I-PER
. O
The B-PER
nobleman I-PER
was O
not O
wounded O
in O
the O
duel O
; O
but O
the O
morning O
being O
raw O
and O
damp O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
meeting O
, O
he O
contracted O
a O
severe O
chill O
, O
and O
, O
failing O
to O
throw O
it O
off O
, O
he O
died O
some O
six O
months O
after O
the O
departure O
of O
Prince B-PER
Rudolf I-PER
, O
without O
having O
found O
leisure O
to O
adjust O
his O
relations O
with O
his O
wife O
-- O
who O
, O
after O
another O
two O
months O
, O
bore O
an B-PER
heir I-PER
to O
the O
title O
and O
estates O
of O
the O
family O
of O
Burlesdon B-GPE
. O
This B-PER
lady I-PER
was O
the B-PER
Countess I-PER
Amelia I-PER
, O
whose O
picture O
my B-PER
sister-in-law I-PER
wished O
to O
remove O
from O
the O
drawing-room O
in O
Park B-FAC
Lane I-FAC
; O
and O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
was O
James B-PER
, O
fifth O
Earl O
of O
Burlesdon B-PER
and O
twenty-second O
Baron B-PER
Rassendyll O
, O
both O
in O
the O
peerage O
of O
England B-GPE
, O
and O
a B-PER
Knight I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
Garter I-PER
. O
As O
for O
Rudolf B-PER
, O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Ruritania B-GPE
, O
married O
a B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
and O
ascended O
the O
throne O
, O
whereon O
his B-PER
progeny I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
direct I-PER
line I-PER
have O
sat O
from O
then O
till O
this O
very O
hour O
-- O
with O
one O
short O
interval O
. O
And O
, O
finally O
, O
if O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
picture O
galleries O
at O
Burlesdon B-GPE
, O
among O
the O
fifty O
portraits O
or O
so O
of O
the O
last O
century O
and O
a O
half O
, O
you O
will O
find O
five O
or O
six O
, O
including O
that O
of O
the B-PER
sixth I-PER
earl I-PER
, O
distinguished O
by O
long O
, O
sharp O
, O
straight O
noses O
and O
a O
quantity O
of O
dark-red O
hair O
; O
these O
five O
or O
six O
have O
also O
blue O
eyes O
, O
whereas O
among O
the B-PER
Rassendylls I-PER
dark O
eyes O
are O
the O
commoner O
. O
That O
is O
the O
explanation O
, O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
have O
finished O
it O
: O
the O
blemishes O
on O
honourable O
lineage O
are O
a O
delicate O
subject O
, O
and O
certainly O
this O
heredity O
we O
hear O
so O
much O
about O
is O
the O
finest O
scandalmonger O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
; O
it O
laughs O
at O
discretion O
, O
and O
writes O
strange O
entries O
between O
the O
lines O
of O
the O
“ O
Peerages O
” O
. O
It O
will O
be O
observed O
that O
my B-PER
sister-in-law I-PER
, O
with O
a O
want O
of O
logic O
that O
must O
have O
been O
peculiar O
to O
herself O
( O
since O
we O
are O
no O
longer O
allowed O
to O
lay O
it O
to O
the O
charge O
of O
her O
sex O
) O
, O
treated O
my O
complexion O
almost O
as O
an O
offence O
for O
which O
I O
was O
responsible O
, O
hastening O
to O
assume O
from O
that O
external O
sign O
inward O
qualities O
of O
which O
I O
protest O
my O
entire O
innocence O
; O
and O
this O
unjust O
inference O
she O
sought O
to O
buttress O
by O
pointing O
to O
the O
uselessness O
of O
the O
life O
I O
had O
led O
. O
Well O
, O
be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
I O
had O
picked O
up O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
pleasure O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
knowledge O
. O
I O
had O
been O
to O
a B-ORG
German I-ORG
school I-ORG
and O
a B-ORG
German I-ORG
university I-ORG
, O
and O
spoke O
German O
as O
readily O
and O
perfectly O
as O
English O
; O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
at O
home O
in O
French O
; O
I O
had O
a O
smattering O
of O
Italian O
and O
enough O
Spanish O
to O
swear O
by O
. O
I O
was O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
a B-PER
strong I-PER
, I-PER
though I-PER
hardly I-PER
fine I-PER
swordsman I-PER
and O
a B-PER
good I-PER
shot I-PER
. O
I O
could O
ride O
anything O
that O
had O
a O
back O
to O
sit O
on O
; O
and O
my O
head O
was O
as O
cool O
a O
one O
as O
you O
could O
find O
, O
for O
all O
its O
flaming O
cover O
. O
If O
you O
say O
that O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
spent O
my O
time O
in O
useful O
labour O
, O
I O
am O
out O
of O
Court B-FAC
and O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
, O
save O
that O
my B-PER
parents I-PER
had O
no O
business O
to O
leave O
me O
two O
thousand O
pounds O
a O
year O
and O
a O
roving O
disposition O
. O
“ O
The O
difference O

you O

Robert B-PER

” O
said O
my O
sister-in-law O
, O
who O
often O
( O
bless O
her O
! O
) O
speaks O
on O
a O
platform O
, O
and O
oftener O
still O
as O
if O
she O
were O
on O
one O
, O
“ O
is O
that O

recognizes O
the O

“ O
To O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
spirit I-PER

my B-PER
dear I-PER
Rose B-PER

” O
I O
answered O
, O
“ O

are O
duties O

” O
“ O
Nonsense O
! O
” O
said O
she O
, O
tossing O
her O
head O
; O
and O
after O
a O
moment O
she O
went O
on O
: O
“ O
Now O
, O
here O

Sir B-PER
Jacob O
Borrodaile O
offering O
you O
exactly O
what O
you O
might O

” O
“ O
A O
thousand O
thanks O

” O
I O
murmured O
. O
“ O
He O
’s O
to O
have O
an B-FAC
Embassy I-FAC
in O
six O

, O
and O
Robert B-PER
says O
he O
is O
sure O
that O
he O
’ll O
take O
you O
as O
an B-PER
attache I-PER
. O
Do O
take O
it O
, O
Rudolf B-PER
-- O
to O
please O
me O
. O
” O
Now O
, O
when O
my B-PER
sister-in-law I-PER
puts O
the O
matter O
in O
that O
way O
, O
wrinkling O
her O
pretty O
brows O
, O
twisting O
her O
little O
hands O
, O
and O
growing O
wistful O
in O
the O
eyes O
, O
all O
on O
account O
of O
an B-PER
idle I-PER
scamp I-PER
like I-PER
myself I-PER
, I-PER
for I-PER
whom I-PER
she I-PER
has I-PER
no I-PER
natural I-PER
responsibility I-PER
, O
I O
am O
visited O
with O
compunction O
. O
Moreover O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
possible O
that O
I O
could O
pass O
the O
time O
in O
the O
position O
suggested O
with O
some O
tolerable O
amusement O
. O
Therefore O
I O
said O
: O
“ O
My B-PER
dear I-PER
sister I-PER
, O
if O
in O

no O

Sir B-PER

hang O
me O

I O
do O

go O

Sir B-PER
Jacob O

” O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Rudolf B-PER
, O
how O
good O
of O
you O
! O
I O
am O
glad O
! O
” O
“ O
Where O

he O
going O

? O
” O
“ O
He O
does O
n’t O
know O
yet O
; O
but O
it O
’s O
sure O
to O
be O
a B-FAC
good I-FAC
Embassy I-FAC
. O
” O
“ O
Madame B-PER
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
“ O
for O
your O
sake O
I O
’ll O
go O
, O
if O
it O
’s O
no O
more O
than O
a O

Legation O
. O
When O
I O
do O
a O
thing O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
do O
it O
by O

. O
” O
My O
promise O
, O
then O
, O
was O
given O
; O
but O
six O
months O
are O
six O
months O
, O
and O
seem O
an O
eternity O
, O
and O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
they O
stretched O
between O
me O
and O
my O
prospective O
industry O
( O
I O
suppose O
attaches B-PER
are O
industrious O
; O
but O
I O
know O
not O
, O
for O
I O
never O
became O
attache O
to O
Sir B-PER
Jacob O
or O
anybody O
else O
) O
, O
I O
cast O
about O
for O
some O
desirable O
mode O
of O
spending O
them O
. O
And O
it O
occurred O
to O
me O
suddenly O
that O
I O
would O
visit O
Ruritania B-GPE
. O
It O
may O
seem O
strange O
that O
I O
had O
never O
visited O
that B-GPE
country I-GPE
yet O
; O
but O
my B-PER
father I-PER
( O
in O
spite O
of O
a O
sneaking O
fondness O
for O
the B-PER
Elphbergs I-PER
, O
which O
led O
him O
to O
give O
me O
, O
his B-PER
second I-PER
son I-PER
, O
the O
famous O
Elphberg B-PER
name O
of O
Rudolf B-PER
) O
had O
always O
been O
averse O
from O
my O
going O
, O
and O
, O
since O
his O
death O
, O
my O
brother O
, O
prompted O
by O
Rose B-PER
, O
had O
accepted O
the B-PER
family I-PER
tradition O
which O
taught O
that O
a O
wide O
berth O
was O
to O
be O
given O
to O
that B-GPE
country I-GPE
. O
But O
the O
moment O
Ruritania B-GPE
had O
come O
into O
my O
head O
I O
was O
eaten O
up O
with O
a O
curiosity O
to O
see O
it O
. O
After O
all O
, O
red O
hair O
and O
long O
noses O
are O
not O
confined O
to O
the O
House O
of O
Elphberg B-PER
, O
and O
the O
old O
story O
seemed O
a O
preposterously O
insufficient O
reason O
for O
debarring O
myself O
from O
acquaintance O
with O
a B-GPE
highly I-GPE
interesting I-GPE
and I-GPE
important I-GPE
kingdom I-GPE
, O
one O
which O
had O
played O
no O
small O
part O
in O
European O
history O
, O
and O
might O
do O
the O
like O
again O
under O
the O
sway O
of O
a O
young O
and O
vigorous O
ruler O
, O
such O
as O
the B-PER
new I-PER
King I-PER
was O
rumoured O
to O
be O
. O
My O
determination O
was O
clinched O
by O
reading O
in O
_ O
The O
Times O
_ O
that O
Rudolf B-PER
the I-PER
Fifth I-PER

to O

that O

was O

At O
once O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
to O
be O
present O

and O
began O
my O
preparations O

But O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
has O
never O
been O
my O
practice O
to O
furnish O
my B-PER

an O

in O
this O

I O
anticipated O

I O
gave O
out O

When O
Newland B-PER
Archer I-PER
opened O
the O
door O
at O
the B-FAC
back I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
club I-FAC
box I-FAC
the O
curtain O
had O
just O
gone O
up O
on O
the O
garden O
scene O
. O
There O
was O
no O
reason O
why O
the B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
should O
not O
have O
come O
earlier O
, O
for O
he O
had O
dined O
at O
seven O
, O
alone O
with O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
and O
sister B-PER
, O
and O
had O
lingered O
afterward O
over O
a O
cigar O
in O
the B-FAC
Gothic I-FAC
library I-FAC
with O
glazed O
black-walnut O
bookcases O
and O
finial-topped O
chairs O
which O
was O
the O
only O
room O
in O
the O
house O
where O
Mrs. B-PER
Archer O
allowed O
smoking O
. O
But O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
was O
a B-GPE
metropolis I-GPE
, O
and O
perfectly O
aware O
that O
in O
metropolises B-GPE
it O
was O
" O
not O
the O
thing O
" O
to O
arrive O
early O
at O
the B-FAC
opera I-FAC
; O
and O
what O
was O
or O
was O
not O
" O
the O
thing O
" O
played O
a O
part O
as O
important O
in O
Newland B-PER
Archer I-PER
's O
New O
York O
as O
the O
inscrutable O
totem O
terrors O
that O
had O
ruled O
the O
destinies O
of O
his B-PER
forefathers I-PER
thousands O
of O
years O
ago O
. O
The O
second O
reason O
for O
his O
delay O
was O
a O
personal O
one O
. O
He O
had O
dawdled O
over O
his O
cigar O
because O
he O
was O
at O
heart O
a B-PER
dilettante I-PER
, O
and O
thinking O
over O
a O
pleasure O
to O
come O
often O
gave O
him O
a O
subtler O
satisfaction O
than O
its O
realisation O
. O
This O
was O
especially O
the O
case O
when O
the O
pleasure O
was O
a O
delicate O
one O
, O
as O
his O
pleasures O
mostly O
were O
; O
and O
on O
this O
occasion O
the O
moment O
he O
looked O
forward O
to O
was O
so O
rare O
and O
exquisite O
in O
quality O
that O
-- O
well O
, O
if O
he O
had O
timed O
his O
arrival O
in O
accord O
with O
the B-PER
prima I-PER
donna I-PER
's O
stage-manager O
he O
could O
not O
have O
entered O
the B-FAC
Academy I-FAC
at O
a O
more O
significant O
moment O
than O
just O
as O
she O
was O
singing O
: O
" O
He O
loves O
me O
-- O
he O
loves O
me O
not O
-- O
HE O
LOVES O
ME O
! O
-- O
" O
and O
sprinkling O
the O
falling O
daisy O
petals O
with O
notes O
as O
clear O
as O
dew O
. O
She O
sang O
, O
of O
course O
, O
" O
M'ama O
! O
" O
and O
not O
" O
he O
loves O
me O
, O
" O
since O
an O
unalterable O
and O
unquestioned O
law O
of O
the O
musical O
world O
required O
that O
the O
German O
text O
of O
French O
operas O
sung O
by O
Swedish B-PER
artists I-PER
should O
be O
translated O
into O
Italian O
for O
the O
clearer O
understanding O
of O
English-speaking B-PER
audiences I-PER
. O
This O
seemed O
as O
natural O
to O
Newland B-PER
Archer I-PER
as O
all O
the O
other O
conventions O
on O
which O
his O
life O
was O
moulded O
: O
such O
as O
the O
duty O
of O
using O
two O
silver-backed O
brushes O
with O
his O
monogram O
in O
blue O
enamel O
to O
part O
his O
hair O
, O
and O
of O
never O
appearing O
in O
society O
without O
a O
flower O
( O
preferably O
a O
gardenia O
) O
in O
his O
buttonhole O
. O
" O
M'ama O

" O
the B-PER

sang O
, O
and O
" O
M'ama O
! O
" O
, O
with O
a O
final O
burst O
of O
love O
triumphant O
, O
as O
she O
pressed O
the O
dishevelled O
daisy O
to O
her O
lips O
and O
lifted O
her O
large O
eyes O
to O
the O
sophisticated O
countenance O
of O
the B-PER
little I-PER
brown I-PER
Faust-Capoul I-PER
, O
who O
was O
vainly O
trying O
, O
in O
a O
tight O
purple O
velvet O
doublet O
and O
plumed O
cap O
, O
to O
look O
as O
pure O
and O
true O
as O
his B-PER
artless I-PER
victim I-PER
. O
Newland B-PER
Archer I-PER
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
wall O
at O
the B-FAC
back I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
club I-FAC
box I-FAC
, O
turned O
his O
eyes O
from O
the O
stage O
and O
scanned O
the B-FAC
opposite I-FAC
side I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
Directly O
facing O
him O
was O
the O
box O
of O
old O
Mrs. B-PER
Manson O
Mingott O
, O
whose O
monstrous O
obesity O
had O
long O
since O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
attend O
the B-FAC
Opera I-FAC
, O
but O
who O
was O
always O
represented O
on O
fashionable O
nights O
by O
some O
of O
the B-PER
younger I-PER
members I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
family I-PER
. O
On O
this O
occasion O
, O
the B-FAC
front I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
box I-FAC
was O
filled O
by O
her B-PER
daughter-in-law I-PER

Mrs. B-PER
Lovell O
Mingott O

her B-PER
daughter I-PER
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Welland O
; O
and O
slightly O
withdrawn O
behind O
these B-PER
brocaded I-PER
matrons I-PER
sat O
a O
young O
girl O
in O
white O
with O
eyes O
ecstatically O
fixed O
on O
the B-PER
stagelovers I-PER
. O
As O
Madame B-PER
Nilsson O
's O
" O
M'ama O

" O
thrilled O
out O
above O
the B-FAC
silent I-FAC
house I-FAC
( O
the B-PER
boxes I-PER
always O
stopped O
talking O
during O
the O
Daisy O

) O
a O
warm O
pink O
mounted O
to O
the B-PER
girl I-PER

cheek O
, O
mantled O
her O
brow O
to O
the O
roots O
of O
her O
fair O
braids O
, O
and O
suffused O
the O
young O
slope O
of O
her O
breast O
to O
the O
line O
where O
it O
met O
a O
modest O
tulle O
tucker O
fastened O
with O
a O
single O
gardenia O
. O
She O
dropped O
her O
eyes O
to O
the O
immense O
bouquet O
of O
lilies-of-the-valley O
on O
her O
knee O
, O
and O
Newland B-PER
Archer I-PER
saw O
her O
white-gloved O
finger-tips O
touch O
the O
flowers O
softly O
. O
He O
drew O
a O
breath O
of O
satisfied O
vanity O
and O
his O
eyes O
returned O
to O
the O
stage O
. O
No O
expense O
had O
been O
spared O
on O
the O
setting O
, O
which O
was O
acknowledged O
to O
be O
very O
beautiful O
even O
by O
people O
who O
shared O
his O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
Opera O
houses O
of O
Paris B-GPE
and O
Vienna B-GPE
. O
The O
foreground O
, O
to O
the O
footlights O

was O
covered O
with O
emerald O
green O
cloth O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
distance O
symmetrical O
mounds O
of O
woolly O
green O
moss O
bounded O
by O
croquet O
hoops O
formed O
the O
base O
of O
shrubs O
shaped O
like O
orange-trees O
but O
studded O
with O
large O
pink O
and O
red O
roses O
. O
Gigantic O
pansies O
, O
considerably O
larger O
than O
the O
roses O
, O
and O
closely O
resembling O
the O
floral O
pen-wipers O
made O
by O
female B-PER
parishioners I-PER
for O
fashionable B-PER
clergymen I-PER
, O
sprang O
from O
the O
moss O
beneath O
the O
rose-trees O
; O
and O
here O

there O
a O
daisy O
grafted O
on O

flowered O
with O
a O

of O

In O

listened O
with O
downcast O
eyes O
to O
M. B-PER
Capoul I-PER

impassioned O
wooing O
, O
and O
affected O
a O
guileless O
incomprehension O
of O
his O

by O

he O
persuasively O
indicated O

" O
The O

thought O
Newland B-PER

his O

flitting O
back O
to O
the B-PER

with I-PER

. O
" O
She O
does O
n't O
even O
guess O
what O
it O

all O
about O

" O
And O
he O
contemplated O
her O
absorbed O
young O
face O
with O
a O
thrill O
of O
possessorship O
in O
which O
pride O
in O
his O
own O
masculine O
initiation O
was O
mingled O
with O
a O
tender O
reverence O
for O

abysmal O
purity O

" O
We O
'll O
read O

" O
he O
thought O

somewhat O
hazily O
confusing O
the O
scene O
of O
his O
projected O
honey-moon O
with O
the O
masterpieces O
of O
literature O
which O
it O
would O
be O
his O
manly O
privilege O
to O
reveal O
to O
his B-PER

It O
was O
only O
that O
afternoon O
that O
May B-PER

had O
let O
him O
guess O
that O

( O
New B-GPE

and O
already O

leaping O
ahead O
of O
the O
engagement O

the O

the O
march O
from O

pictured O
her O

He O
did O
not O

least O
wish O
the O
future O
Mrs. B-PER
Newland B-PER
Archer I-PER
to O
be O
a B-PER
simpleton I-PER

He O
meant O
her O
( O
thanks O
to O
his O
enlightening O
companionship O
) O
to O
develop O
a O
social O
tact O
and O
readiness O
of O
wit O
enabling O
her O
to O
hold O
her O
own O
with O
the B-PER
most I-PER
popular I-PER

women I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
" I-PER
younger I-PER
set I-PER

" O
in O
which O
it O
was O
the O
recognised O
custom O
to O
attract O
masculine O
homage O
while O
playfully O
discouraging O
it O

If O
he O
had O
probed O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
vanity O
( O
as O
he O
sometimes O
nearly O
did O
) O
he O
would O
have O
found O
there O
the O
wish O
that O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
should O
be O
as O
worldly-wise O
and O
as O
eager O
to O
please O
as O
the B-PER
married I-PER
lady I-PER
whose I-PER
charms I-PER
had I-PER
held I-PER
his I-PER
fancy I-PER
through I-PER
two I-PER
mildly I-PER
agitated I-PER
years I-PER
; O
without O
, O
of O

any O

of O
the O
frailty O

had O
so O
nearly O
marred O
that B-PER
unhappy I-PER

life I-PER
, O
and O
had O
disarranged O
his O

plans O
for O

How O
this O
miracle O
of O
fire O

was O
to O
be O
created O
, O
and O
to O
sustain O
itself O
in O
a B-LOC
harsh I-LOC

, O
he O
had O
never O
taken O
the O
time O
to O
think O
out O

but O
he O
was O
content O
to O
hold O
his O

of O
all B-PER
the I-PER

white-waistcoated I-PER

exchanged O

turned O
their O
opera-glasses O
critically O
on O
the B-PER
circle I-PER

were I-PER
the I-PER
product I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
system I-PER

In O
matters O
intellectual O

artistic O
Newland B-PER
Archer I-PER
felt O
himself O
distinctly O
the B-PER
superior I-PER
of I-PER
these I-PER
chosen I-PER
specimens I-PER
of I-PER
old I-PER
New I-PER

gentility I-PER
; O
he O
had O
probably O
read O
more O

thought O
more O
, O
and O
even O
seen O
a O
good O
deal O
more O
of O
the B-LOC

than O
any B-PER
other I-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
number I-PER

Singly O
they O
betrayed O
their O
inferiority O
; O
but O
grouped O
together O
they O
represented O
" O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
" O
and O
the O
habit O
of O
masculine O
solidarity O
made O
him O
accept O
their O
doctrine O
on O
all O
the O
issues O
called O
moral O
. O
He O
instinctively O
felt O
that O
in O
this O
respect O
it O
would O
be O
troublesome O
-- O
and O
also O
rather O
bad O
form O
-- O
to O
strike O
out O
for O
himself O
. O
" O
Well O

" O
exclaimed O
Lawrence B-PER

turning O
his O

abruptly O
away O

Lawrence B-PER

on O
the O
whole O
, O
the O
foremost O
authority O
on O

in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O
He O
had O
probably O
devoted O
more O
time O
than O
any B-PER
one I-PER
else I-PER
to O
the O
study O
of O
this O
intricate O
and O
fascinating O
question O
; O
but O
study O
alone O
could O
not O
account O
for O
his O
complete O
and O
easy O
competence O
. O
One O
had O
only O
to O
look O
at O
him O
, O
from O
the O
slant O
of O
his O
bald O
forehead O
and O
the O
curve O
of O
his O
beautiful O
fair O

to O
the O
long O
patent-leather O

The B-VEH

swung O
to O
her O
anchor O
without O
a O
flutter O
of O
the O
sails O
, O
and O
was O
at O
rest O
. O
The O
flood O
had O
made O
, O
the O
wind O
was O
nearly O
calm O
, O
and O
being O
bound O
down O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
the O
only O
thing O
for O
it O
was O
to O
come O
to O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
tide O
. O
The O
sea-reach O
of O
the B-LOC
Thames I-LOC
stretched O
before O
us O
like O
the O
beginning O
of O
an B-LOC
interminable I-LOC
waterway I-LOC
. O
In O
the O
offing O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
and O
the O
sky O
were O
welded O
together O
without O
a O
joint O
, O
and O
in O
the O
luminous O
space O
the O
tanned O
sails O
of O
the B-VEH
barges I-VEH
drifting O
up O
with O
the O

seemed O
to O
stand O
still O
in O
red O
clusters O
of O
canvas O
sharply O
peaked O

with O
gleams O
of O
varnished O

A O
haze O
rested O
on O
the O
low O
shores O
that O
ran O
out O
to O
sea B-LOC
in O
vanishing O
flatness O
. O
The O
air O
was O
dark O
above O
Gravesend B-GPE
, O
and O
farther O
back O
still O
seemed O
condensed O
into O
a O
mournful O
gloom O
, O
brooding O
motionless O
over O
the O

the O

The B-PER
Director I-PER
of I-PER
Companies I-PER
was O
our B-PER
captain I-PER
and O
our B-PER
host I-PER
. O
We B-PER
four I-PER
affectionately O
watched O
his B-PER
back I-PER
as O
he O
stood O
in O
the O
bows O
looking O
to O
seaward O
. O
On O
the B-LOC
whole I-LOC
river I-LOC
there O
was O
nothing O
that O
looked O
half O
so O
nautical O
. O
He O
resembled O
a B-PER
pilot I-PER
, O
which O
to O
a B-PER
seaman I-PER
is O
trustworthiness O
personified O
. O
It O
was O
difficult O
to O
realize O
his O
work O
was O
not O
out O
there B-LOC
in O
the B-LOC
luminous I-LOC
estuary I-LOC
, O
but O
behind O
him O
, O
within O
the O
brooding O
gloom O

Between O
us O
there O
was O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
said O
somewhere O
, O
the O
bond O
of O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
. O
Besides O
holding O
our B-PER
hearts I-PER
together O
through O
long O
periods O
of O
separation O
, O
it O
had O
the O
effect O
of O
making O
us O
tolerant O
of O
each O
other O
's O
yarns O
-- O
and O
even O
convictions O
. O
The B-PER
Lawyer I-PER
-- O
the O
best O
of O
old B-PER
fellows I-PER
-- O
had O
, O
because O
of O
his O
many O
years O

many O
virtues O
, O
the O
only O
cushion O
on O
deck B-FAC
, O
and O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
only O
rug O
. O
The B-PER
Accountant I-PER
had O
brought O
out O
already O
a O
box O
of O
dominoes O
, O
and O
was O
toying O
architecturally O
with O
the O
bones O
. O
Marlow B-PER
sat O
cross-legged O
right O
aft O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
mizzen-mast O
. O
He O
had O
sunken O
cheeks O
, O
a O
yellow O
complexion O
, O
a O
straight O
back O
, O
an O
ascetic O
aspect O
, O
and O
, O
with O
his O
arms O
dropped O
, O
the O
palms O
of O
hands O
outwards O
, O
resembled O
an B-PER
idol I-PER
. O
The B-PER
director I-PER
, O
satisfied O
the O
anchor O
had O
good O
hold O
, O
made O
his O
way O
aft O
and O
sat O
down O
amongst O
us O
. O
We O
exchanged O
a O
few O
words O
lazily O
. O
Afterwards O
there O
was O
silence O
on O
board O
the B-VEH
yacht I-VEH
. O
For O
some O
reason O
or O
other O
we O
did O
not O
begin O
that O
game O
of O
dominoes O
. O
We O
felt O
meditative O
, O
and O
fit O
for O
nothing O
but O
placid O
staring O
. O
The O
day O
was O
ending O
in O
a O
serenity O
of O
still O
and O
exquisite O
brilliance O
. O
The O
water B-LOC
shone O
pacifically O
; O
the O
sky O
, O
without O
a O
speck O
, O
was O
a O
benign O
immensity O
of O
unstained O
light O
; O
the O
very O
mist O
on O
the B-LOC
Essex I-LOC
marsh I-LOC
was O
like O
a O
gauzy O
and O
radiant O
fabric O
, O
hung O
from O
the B-LOC
wooded I-LOC
rises I-LOC
inland I-LOC
, O
and O
draping O
the B-LOC
low I-LOC
shores I-LOC
in O
diaphanous O
folds O
. O
Only O
the O
gloom O
to O
the O
west O
, O
brooding O
over O
the B-LOC
upper I-LOC
reaches I-LOC
, O
became O
more O
sombre O
every O
minute O
, O
as O
if O
angered O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
sun O
. O
And O
at O
last O
, O
in O
its O
curved O
and O
imperceptible O
fall O
, O
the O
sun O
sank O
low O
, O
and O
from O
glowing O
white O
changed O
to O
a O
dull O
red O
without O
rays O
and O
without O
heat O
, O
as O
if O
about O
to O
go O
out O
suddenly O
, O
stricken O
to O
death O
by O
the O
touch O
of O
that O
gloom O
brooding O
over O
a B-PER
crowd I-PER
of I-PER
men I-PER
. O
Forthwith O
a O
change O
came O
over O
the B-LOC
waters I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
serenity O
became O
less O
brilliant O
but O
more O
profound O
. O
The B-LOC
old I-LOC
river I-LOC
in I-LOC
its I-LOC
broad I-LOC
reach I-LOC
rested O
unruffled O
at O
the O
decline O
of O
day O
, O
after O
ages O
of O
good O
service O
done O
to O
the B-PER
race I-PER
that I-PER
peopled I-PER
its I-PER
banks I-PER

spread O
out O
in O
the O
tranquil O
dignity O
of O
a O
waterway O
leading O
to O
the O
uttermost O
ends O
of O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC

We O
looked O
at O
the B-LOC
venerable I-LOC
stream I-LOC
not O
in O
the O
vivid O
flush O
of O
a O
short O
day O
that O
comes O
and O
departs O
for O
ever O
, O
but O
in O
the O
august O
light O
of O

And O
indeed O
nothing O
is O
easier O
for O
a O
man O
who O
has O

the O
phrase O
goes O

“ O

with O

the O

“ O

“ O

” O
He O

the O
only O

still O
“ O
followed O

” O
The O
worst O
that O
could O
be O
said O
of O
him O
was O
that O
he O
did O
not O
represent O
his B-PER
class I-PER
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
seaman I-PER
, O
but O
he O
was O
a B-PER
wanderer I-PER
, O
too O
, O
while O
most O
seamen B-PER
lead O
, O
if O
one O
may O
so O
express O
it O
, O
a O
sedentary O
life O
. O
Their O
minds O
are O
of O
the O
stay-at-home O
order O
, O
and O
their B-FAC
home I-FAC
is O
always O
with O
them O
-- O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
; O
and O
so O
is O
their O
country O
-- O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
. O
One B-VEH
ship I-VEH
is O
very O
much O
like O
another O
, O
and O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
is O
always O
the O
same O
. O
In O
the O
immutability O
of O
their O
surroundings O
the B-LOC
foreign I-LOC

the B-PER
foreign I-PER
faces I-PER

the O
changing O
immensity O
of O

, O
glide O
past O
, O
veiled O
not O
by O
a O
sense O
of O
mystery O
but O
by O
a O
slightly O
disdainful O
ignorance O
; O
for O
there O
is O
nothing O
mysterious O
to O
a B-PER
seaman I-PER
unless O
it O
be O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
itself O
, O
which O
is O
the O
mistress O
of O
his O
existence O
and O
as O
inscrutable O
as O
Destiny O
. O
For O
the O
rest O
, O
after O
his O
hours O
of O
work O
, O
a O
casual O
stroll O
or O
a O
casual O
spree O
on O
shore B-LOC
suffices O
to O
unfold O
for O
him O
the O
secret O
of O
a O
whole O
continent O
, O
and O
generally O
he O
finds O
the O
secret O
not O
worth O
knowing O
. O
The O
yarns O
of O
seamen B-PER
have O
a O
direct O
simplicity O
, O
the O
whole O
meaning O
of O
which O
lies O
within O
the O
shell O
of O
a O
cracked O
nut O
. O
But O
Marlow B-PER
was O
not O
typical O
( O
if O
his O
propensity O
to O
spin O
yarns O
be O
excepted O
) O
, O
and O
to O
him O
the O
meaning O
of O
an O
episode O
was O
not O
inside O
like O
a O
kernel O
but O
outside O
, O
enveloping O
the O
tale O
which O
brought O
it O
out O
only O
as O
a O
glow O
brings O
out O
a O
haze O
, O
in O
the O
likeness O
of O
one O
of O
these O
misty O
halos O
that O
sometimes O
are O
made O
visible O
by O
the O
spectral O
illumination O
of O
moonshine O
. O
His O
remark O
did O
not O
seem O
at O
all O
surprising O
. O
It O
was O
just O
like O
Marlow B-PER
. O
It O
was O
accepted O
in O
silence O
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
took O
the O
trouble O
to O
grunt O
even O
; O
and O
presently O
he O
said O
, O
very O
slow O

“ O
I O

in O

about O
two O

A B-LOC
small I-LOC

glides O
through O
it O

with O
just O
murmur O
enough O

lull O
one O
to O
repose O
; O
and O
the O
occasional O
whistle O
of O
a O
quail O

tapping O
of O
a O
woodpecker O
is O
almost O
the O
only O
sound O
that O
ever O
breaks O
in O
upon O
the O
uniform O
tranquillity O

I O
recollect O
that O
, O
when O
a B-PER
stripling I-PER
, O
my O
first O
exploit O
in O
squirrel-shooting O
was O
in O
a O
grove O
of O
tall O
walnut-trees O
that O
shades O
one O
side O
of O
the B-LOC

I O
had O
wandered O
into O
it O
at O
noontime O
, O
when O
all O
nature O
is O
peculiarly O
quiet O
, O
and O
was O
startled O
by O
the O
roar O
of O
my O
own O
gun O
, O
as O
it O
broke O
the O
Sabbath O
stillness O
around O
and O
was O
prolonged O
and O
reverberated O
by O
the O
angry O
echoes O
. O
If O
ever O
I O
should O
wish O
for O
a O
retreat O
whither O
I O
might O
steal O
from O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC

its O

dream O
quietly O
away O
the O

none O
more O

this B-LOC

the O

the B-LOC

under O
the O

some O

power O

that O
holds O
a O
spell O
over O
the O
minds O
of O
the B-PER
good I-PER
people I-PER

causing O
them O

the O

The O

seems O
to O
be O
commander-in-chief O
of O
all O
the O
powers O
of O

is O
the O
apparition O
of O
a B-PER
figure I-PER
on I-PER
horseback I-PER
, I-PER
without I-PER
a I-PER
head I-PER
. O
It O
is O
said O
by O
some O
to O
be O
the O
ghost O
of O
a O
Hessian O
trooper O
, O
whose O
head O
had O
been O
carried O
away O
by O
a O
cannon-ball O
, O
in O
some O
nameless O
battle O
during O
the O
Revolutionary O
War O
, O
and O
who O
is O
ever O
and O
anon O
seen O
by O
the B-PER
country I-PER
folk I-PER
hurrying O
along O
in O
the O
gloom O
of O
night O
, O
as O
if O
on O
the O
wings O
of O
the O

His O
haunts O
are O
not O
confined O
to O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC

but O
extend O
at O
times O
to O
the B-FAC
adjacent I-FAC
roads I-FAC
, O
and O
especially O
to O
the O
vicinity O
of O
a B-FAC
church I-FAC
at O
no O
great O
distance O
. O
Indeed O
, O
certain O
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
historians O
of O
those B-LOC
parts I-LOC
, O
who O
have O
been O
careful O
in O
collecting O
and O
collating O
the O
floating O
facts O
concerning O
this B-PER
spectre I-PER
, O
allege O
that O
the O
body O
of O
the B-PER
trooper I-PER
having O
been O
buried O
in O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
, O
the B-PER
ghost I-PER
rides O
forth O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
battle O
in O
nightly O
quest O
of O
his O
head O
, O
and O
that O
the O
rushing O
speed O
with O
which O
he O
sometimes O
passes O
along O
the B-LOC
Hollow I-LOC
, O
like O
a O
midnight O
blast O
, O
is O
owing O
to O
his O
being O
belated O
, O
and O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
before O
daybreak O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
general O
purport O
of O
this O
legendary O
superstition O
, O
which O
has O
furnished O
materials O
for O
many O
a O
wild O
story O
in O
that B-LOC
region I-LOC

the B-PER

by O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Headless O

of O
Sleepy B-LOC

It O
is O
remarkable O
that O
the O
visionary O

I O
have O
mentioned O
is O
not O
confined O
to O
the O
native O
inhabitants O
of O
the B-LOC

is O
unconsciously O
imbibed O
by O
every O
one O
who O

there B-LOC
for O
a O

However O
wide O
awake O
they O
may O
have O

before O
they O
entered O
that B-LOC
sleepy I-LOC
region I-LOC

they O
are O
sure O
, O
in O
a O
little O
time O
, O
to O
inhale O
the O
witching O
influence O
of O
the O
air O
, O
and O
begin O
to O
grow O
imaginative O

to O

dreams O

I O
mention O
this B-LOC
peaceful I-LOC
spot I-LOC
with O
all O
possible O
laud O
, O
for O
it O
is O
in O
such O
little O

there O
embosomed O
in O
the B-GPE

while O
the O

such O
incessant O
changes O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
this B-GPE
restless I-GPE

sweeps O
by O
them O

They O
are O

yet O
I O
question O
whether O
I O

not O
still O
find O
the O

the O

families O
vegetating O
in O
its O

In O
this O
by-place O
of O
nature O
there O
abode O
, O
in O
a O
remote O
period O
of O
American O
history O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
some O
thirty O
years O
since O
, O
a O
worthy O
wight O
of O
the O
name O
of O
Ichabod B-PER
Crane I-PER
, O
who O
sojourned O
, O
or O
, O
as O
he O
expressed O
it O
, O
“ O
tarried O
, O
” O
in O
Sleepy B-LOC
Hollow I-LOC
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
instructing O
the O
children O
of O
the B-LOC
vicinity I-LOC
. O
He O
was O
a O
native O
of O
Connecticut B-GPE
, O
a O
State O
which O
supplies O
the B-GPE
Union I-GPE
with O
pioneers B-PER
for I-PER
the I-PER
mind I-PER
as O
well O
as O
for O
the B-LOC
forest I-LOC
, O
and O
sends O
forth O
yearly O
its O
legions O
of O
frontier B-PER
woodmen I-PER
and O
country B-PER
schoolmasters I-PER
. O
The O
cognomen O
of O
Crane B-PER
was O
not O
inapplicable O
to O
his B-PER
person I-PER
. O
He O
was O
tall O
, O
but O
exceedingly O
lank O
, O
with O
narrow O
shoulders O
, O
long O
arms O
and O
legs O
, O
hands O
that O
dangled O
a O
mile O
out O
of O
his O
sleeves O
, O
feet O
that O
might O
have O
served O
for O
shovels O
, O
and O
his O
whole O
frame O
most O
loosely O
hung O
together O
. O
His O
head O
was O
small O
, O
and O
flat O
at O
top O
, O
with O
huge O
ears O
, O
large O
green O
glassy O
eyes O
, O
and O
a O
long O
snipe O
nose O
, O
so O
that O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
weather-cock O
perched O
upon O
his O
spindle O
neck O
to O
tell O
which O
way O
the O
wind O
blew O
. O
To O
see O
him O
striding O
along O
the O
profile O
of O
a B-LOC
hill I-LOC
on O
a O
windy O
day O
, O
with O
his O
clothes O
bagging O
and O
fluttering O
about O
him O
, O
one O
might O
have O
mistaken O
him O
for O
the O
genius O
of O
famine O
descending O
upon O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
, O
or O
some O
scarecrow O
eloped O
from O
a B-LOC
cornfield I-LOC
. O
His B-FAC
schoolhouse I-FAC
was O
a O
low O
building O
of O
one B-FAC
large I-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
rudely O
constructed O
of O
logs O
; O
the O
windows O
partly O
glazed O
, O
and O
partly O
patched O
with O
leaves O
of O
old O
copybooks O
. O
It O
was O
most O
ingeniously O
secured O
at O
vacant O
hours O
, O
by O
a O
withe O
twisted O
in O
the O
handle O
of O
the O
door O
, O
and O
stakes O
set O
against O
the O
window O
shutters O
; O
so O
that O
though O
a B-PER
thief I-PER
might O
get O
in O
with O
perfect O
ease O
, O
he O
would O
find O
some O
embarrassment O
in O
getting O
out O
, O
-- O
an O
idea O
most O
probably O
borrowed O
by O
the B-PER
architect I-PER
, O
Yost B-PER
Van I-PER
Houten I-PER
, O
from O
the O
mystery O
of O
an O
eelpot O
. O
The B-FAC
schoolhouse I-FAC
stood O
in O
a O
rather O
lonely O
but O
pleasant O
situation O
, O
just O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a B-LOC
woody I-LOC
hill I-LOC
, O
with O
a B-LOC
brook I-LOC
running O
close O
by O
, O
and O
a O
formidable O
birch-tree O
growing O
at O
one O
end O
of O
it O
. O
From O
hence O
the O
low O
murmur O
of O
his B-PER
pupils I-PER
’ O
voices O
, O
conning O
over O
their O
lessons O
, O
might O
be O
heard O
in O
a O
drowsy O
summer O
’s O
day O
, O
like O
the O
hum O
of O
a O
beehive O
; O
interrupted O
now O
and O
then O
by O
the O
authoritative O
voice O
of O
the B-PER
master I-PER
, O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
menace O
or O
command O
, O
or O
, O
peradventure O
, O
by O
the O
appalling O
sound O
of O
the O
birch O
, O
as O
he O
urged O
some B-PER
tardy I-PER
loiterer I-PER
along O
the O
flowery O
path O
of O
knowledge O
. O
Truth O
to O
say O
, O
he O
was O
a B-PER
conscientious I-PER
man I-PER
, O
and O
ever O
bore O
in O
mind O
the O
golden O
maxim O
, O
“ O
Spare O
the O
rod O
and O
spoil O
the B-PER
child I-PER
. O
” O
Ichabod B-PER
Crane I-PER
’s O
scholars O
certainly O
were O
not O
spoiled O
. O
I O
would O
not O
have O
it O
imagined O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
was O
one O
of O
those O
cruel O
potentates O
of O
the B-ORG
school I-ORG
who O
joy O
in O
the O
smart O
of O
their B-PER
subjects I-PER
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
administered O
justice O
with O
discrimination O
rather O
than O
severity O
; O
taking O
the O
burden O
off O
the O
backs O
of O
the B-PER
weak I-PER
, O
and O
laying O
it O
on O
those O
of O
the B-PER
strong I-PER
. O
Your B-PER
mere I-PER
puny I-PER
stripling I-PER
, I-PER
that I-PER
winced I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
least I-PER
flourish I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
rod I-PER
, O
was O
passed O
by O
with O
indulgence O
; O
but O
the O
claims O
of O
justice O
were O
satisfied O
by O
inflicting O
a O
double O
portion O
on O
some B-PER
little I-PER
tough I-PER
wrong-headed I-PER
, I-PER
broad-skirted I-PER
Dutch I-PER
urchin I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
sulked I-PER
and I-PER
swelled I-PER
and I-PER
grew I-PER
dogged I-PER
and I-PER
sullen I-PER
beneath I-PER
the I-PER
birch I-PER
. O
All O
this O
he O
called O
“ O
doing O
his O
duty O
by O
their B-PER
parents I-PER
; O
” O
and O
he O
never O
inflicted O
a O
chastisement O
without O
following O
it O
by O
the O
assurance O
, O
so O
consolatory O
to O
the B-PER
smarting I-PER
urchin I-PER
, O
that O
“ O
he O
would O
remember O
it O
and O
thank O
him O
for O
it O
the O
longest O
day O
he O
had O
to O
live O
. O
” O
When O
school O
hours O
were O
over O
, O
he O
was O
even O
the O
companion O
and O
playmate O
of O
the B-PER
larger I-PER
boys I-PER
; O
and O
on O
holiday O
afternoons O
would O
convoy O
some O
of O
the B-PER
smaller I-PER
ones I-PER
home B-FAC
, O
who O
happened O
to O
have O
pretty B-PER
sisters I-PER
, O
or O
good B-PER
housewives I-PER
for O
mothers B-PER
, O
noted O
for O
the O
comforts O
of O
the O
cupboard O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
behooved O
him O
to O
keep O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
his B-PER
pupils I-PER
. O
The O
revenue O
arising O
from O
his B-ORG
school I-ORG
was O
small O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
scarcely O
sufficient O
to O
furnish O
him O
with O
daily O
bread O
, O
for O
he O
was O
a O
huge O
feeder O
, O
and O
, O
though O
lank O
, O
had O
the O
dilating O
powers O
of O
an O
anaconda O
; O
but O
to O
help O
out O
his O
maintenance O
, O
he O
was O
, O
according O
to O
country O
custom O
in O
those O
parts O
, O
boarded O
and O
lodged O
at O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
farmers O
whose O
children B-PER
he O
instructed O
. O
With O
these O
he O
lived O
successively O
a O
week O
at O
a O
time O
, O
thus O
going O
the O
rounds O
of O
the B-FAC
neighborhood I-FAC
, O
with O
all O
his O
worldly O
effects O
tied O
up O
in O
a O
cotton O
handkerchief O
. O
That O
all O
this O
might O
not O
be O
too O
onerous O
on O
the O
purses O
of O
his O
rustic O
patrons O
, O
who O
are O
apt O
to O
consider O
the O
costs O
of O
schooling O
a O
grievous O
burden O
, O
and O
schoolmasters B-PER
as O
mere B-PER
drones I-PER
, O
he O
had O
various O
ways O
of O
rendering O
himself O
both O
useful O
and O
agreeable O
. O
He O
assisted O
the B-PER
farmers I-PER
occasionally O
in O
the O
lighter O
labors O
of O
their B-FAC
farms I-FAC
, O
helped O
to O
make O
hay O
, O
mended O
the O
fences O
, O
took O
the O
horses O
to O
water O
, O
drove O
the O
cows O
from O
pasture O
, O
and O
cut O
wood O
for O
the O
winter O
fire O
. O
He O
laid O
aside O
, O
too O
, O
all O
the O
dominant O
dignity O
and O
absolute O
sway O
with O
which O
he O
lorded O
it O
in O
his B-FAC
little I-FAC
empire I-FAC
, O
the B-FAC
school I-FAC
, O
and O
became O
wonderfully O
gentle O
and O
ingratiating O
. O
He O
found O
favor O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the B-PER
mothers I-PER
by O
petting O
the B-PER
children I-PER
, O
particularly O
the O
youngest O
; O
and O
like O
the O
lion O
bold O
, O
which O
whilom O
so O
magnanimously O
the O
lamb O
did O
hold O
, O
he O
would O
sit O
with O
a B-PER
child I-PER
on O
one O
knee O
, O
and O
rock O
a O
cradle O
with O
his O
foot O
for O
whole O
hours O
together O
. O
A O
cloudy O
day O
: O
do O
you O
know O
what O
that O
is O
in O
a B-GPE
town I-GPE
of I-GPE
iron-works I-GPE
? O
The O
sky O
sank O
down O
before O
dawn O
, O
muddy O
, O
flat O
, O
immovable O
. O
The O
air O
is O
thick O
, O
clammy O
with O
the O
breath O
of O
crowded B-PER
human I-PER
beings I-PER
. O
It O
stifles O
me O
. O
I O
open O
the O
window O
, O
and O
, O
looking O
out O
, O
can O
scarcely O
see O
through O
the O
rain O
the B-PER
grocer I-PER
's O
shop O
opposite O
, O
where O
a O
crowd O
of O
drunken B-PER
Irishmen I-PER
are O
puffing O
Lynchburg B-GPE
tobacco O
in O
their O
pipes O

I O
can O
detect O
the O
scent O
through O
all O
the O
foul O
smells O
ranging O
loose O
in O
the O
air O
. O
The O
idiosyncrasy O
of O
this B-GPE
town I-GPE
is O
smoke O
. O
It O
rolls O
sullenly O
in O
slow O
folds O
from O
the O
great O
chimneys O
of O
the B-FAC
iron-foundries I-FAC
, O
and O
settles O
down O
in O
black O
, O
slimy O
pools O
on O
the B-FAC
muddy I-FAC
streets I-FAC
. O
Smoke O
on O
the B-FAC
wharves I-FAC
, O
smoke O
on O
the B-VEH
dingy I-VEH
boats I-VEH
, O
on O
the B-LOC
yellow I-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
-- O
clinging O
in O
a O
coating O
of O
greasy O
soot O
to O
the B-FAC
house-front I-FAC
, O
the O
two O
faded O
poplars O
, O
the O
faces O
of O
the B-PER
passers-by I-PER

The O
long O
train O
of O
mules O
, O
dragging O
masses O
of O
pig-iron O
through O
the B-FAC
narrow I-FAC
street I-FAC
, O
have O
a O
foul O
vapor O
hanging O
to O
their O
reeking O
sides O
. O
Here O
, O
inside O
, O
is O
a O
little O
broken O
figure O
of O
an B-PER
angel I-PER
pointing I-PER
upward I-PER
from I-PER
the I-PER
mantel-shelf I-PER
; O
but O
even O
its O
wings O
are O
covered O
with O
smoke O
, O
clotted O

black O
. O
Smoke O
everywhere O
! O
A O
dirty O
canary O
chirps O
desolately O
in O
a O
cage O
beside O
me O
. O
Its O
dream O
of O
green B-LOC
fields I-LOC
and O
sunshine O
is O
a O
very O
old O
dream O
, O
-- O
almost O
worn O
out O
, O
I O
think O
. O
From O
the O
back-window O
I O
can O
see O
a O
narrow O
brick-yard O
sloping O
down O
to O
the B-LOC
river-side I-LOC
, O
strewed O
with O
rain-butts O
and O
tubs O

The B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
dull O
and O
tawny-colored O
, O
( O
la B-LOC
belle I-LOC
riviere I-LOC
! O
) O
drags O
itself O
sluggishly O
along O
, O
tired O
of O
the O
heavy O
weight O
of O
boats B-VEH
and O
coal-barges B-VEH
. O
What O
wonder O
? O
When O
I O
was O
a B-PER
child I-PER
, O
I O
used O
to O
fancy O
a O
look O
of O
weary O
, O
dumb O
appeal O
upon O
the O
face O
of O
the O
negro-like B-PER
river O
slavishly O
bearing O
its O
burden O
day O
after O
day O
. O
Something O
of O
the O
same O
idle O
notion O
comes O
to O
me O
to-day O
, O
when O
from O
the O
street-window O
I O
look O
on O
the O
slow O
stream O
of O
human B-PER
life I-PER
creeping O
past O
, O
night O
and O
morning O
, O
to O
the B-FAC
great I-FAC
mills I-FAC
. O
Masses O
of O
men B-PER
, O
with O
dull O
, O
besotted O
faces O
bent O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
sharpened O
here O
and O
there O
by O
pain O
or O
cunning O
; O
skin O
and O
muscle O
and O
flesh O
begrimed O
with O
smoke O
and O
ashes O
; O
stooping O
all O
night O
over O
boiling O
caldrons O
of O
metal O
, O
laired O
by O
day O
in O
dens B-FAC
of I-FAC
drunkenness I-FAC
and I-FAC
infamy I-FAC
; O
breathing O
from O
infancy O
to O
death O
an O
air O
saturated O
with O
fog O
and O
grease O
and O
soot O
, O
vileness O
for O
soul O

What O
do O
you O
make O
of O
a O
case O
like O
that O
, O
amateur O
psychologist O
? O
You O
call O
it O
an O
altogether O
serious O
thing O
to O
be O
alive O
: O
to O
these B-PER
men I-PER
it O
is O
a O
drunken O
jest O
, O
a O
joke O
, O
-- O
horrible O
to O
angels B-PER
perhaps O
, O
to O
them O
commonplace O
enough O
. O
My O
fancy O
about O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
was O
an O
idle O
one O
: O
it O
is O
no O
type O
of O
such O
a O
life O
. O
What O
if O
it O
be O
stagnant O
and O
slimy O
here O
? O
It O
knows O
that O
beyond O
there O
waits O
for O
it O
odorous O
sunlight O
, O
quaint B-FAC
old I-FAC
gardens I-FAC
, I-FAC
dusky I-FAC
with I-FAC
soft I-FAC
, I-FAC
green I-FAC
foliage I-FAC
of I-FAC
apple-trees I-FAC

and I-FAC
flushing I-FAC
crimson I-FAC
with I-FAC
roses I-FAC

air O

fields B-LOC

mountains B-LOC

The O
future O
of O
the B-PER
Welsh I-PER
puddler I-PER
passing I-PER
just I-PER
now I-PER
is O
not O
so O
pleasant O
. O
To O
be O
stowed O
away O
, O
after O
his O
grimy O
work O
is O
done O
, O
in O
a O
hole O
in O
the B-FAC
muddy I-FAC
graveyard I-FAC

and O
after O
that O

not O
air O

green B-LOC

curious O

Can O
you O
see O
how O
foggy O
the O
day O
is O
? O
As O
I O
stand O
here O
, O
idly O
tapping O
the O
windowpane O
, O
and O
looking O
out O
through O
the O
rain O
at O
the B-FAC
dirty I-FAC
back-yard I-FAC
and O
the B-VEH
coalboats I-VEH
below O

fragments O
of O
an O
old O
story O
float O
up O
before O
me O
, O
-- O
a O
story O
of O
this B-FAC
house I-FAC
into O
which O
I O
happened O
to O
come O
to-day O

You O
may O
think O
it O
a O
tiresome O
story O
enough O
, O
as O
foggy O
as O
the O
day O
, O
sharpened O
by O
no O
sudden O
flashes O
of O
pain O
or O
pleasure O

-- O
I O
know O
: O
only O
the O
outline O
of O
a O
dull O
life O
, O
that O
long O
since O
, O
with O
thousands O
of O
dull O
lives O
like O
its O
own O
, O
was O
vainly O
lived O
and O
lost O
: O
thousands O
of O
them O
, O
massed O
, O
vile O
, O
slimy O
lives O
, O
like O
those O
of O
the O
torpid O
lizards O
in O
yonder B-LOC
stagnant I-LOC
water-butt I-LOC

-- O
Lost O
? O
There O
is O
a O
curious O
point O
for O
you O
to O
settle O
, O
my B-PER
friend I-PER
, O
who O
study O
psychology O
in O
a O
lazy O

dilettante O

Stop O
a O
moment O

I O
am O
going O

be O
honest O

This O
is O
what O
I O
want O
you O
to O
do O

I O
want O
you O
to O
hide O
your O
disgust O
, O
take O
no O
heed O
to O
your O
clean O
clothes O

and O
come O
right O
down O

me O

here O

into O
the O
thickest O
of O
the O
fog O

mud O

foul O
effluvia O

I O
want O
you O
to O
hear O
this O
story O

There O
is O
a O
secret O
down O
here O
, O
in O
this O
nightmare O
fog O
, O
that O
has O
lain O
dumb O
for O
centuries O
: O
I O
want O
to O
make O
it O
a O
real O
thing O
to O
you O
. O
You O
, O
Egoist B-PER
, O
or O
Pantheist B-PER

or O
Arminian B-PER
, O
busy O
in O
making O
straight O
paths O
for O
your O
feet O
on O
the B-LOC
hills I-LOC
, O
do O
not O
see O
it O
clearly O
, O
-- O
this O
terrible O
question O
which O
men B-PER
here I-PER
have O
gone O
mad O
and O
died O
trying O
to O
answer O
. O
I O
dare O
not O
put O
this O
secret O
into O
words O
. O
I O
told O
you O
it O
was O
dumb O
. O
These B-PER
men I-PER
, O
going O
by O
with O
drunken O
faces O
and O
brains O
full O
of O
unawakened O
power O
, O
do O
not O
ask O
it O
of O
Society O
or O
of O
God B-PER
. O
Their O
lives O
ask O
it O
; O
their O
deaths O
ask O
it O
. O
There O
is O
no O
reply O
. O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
plainly O
that O
I O
have O
a O
great O
hope O
; O
and O
I O
bring O
it O
to O
you O
to O
be O
tested O
. O
It O
is O
this O
: O
that O
this O
terrible O
dumb O
question O
is O
its O
own O
reply O
; O
that O
it O
is O
not O
the O
sentence O
of O
death O
we O
think O
it O
, O
but O
, O
from O
the O
very O
extremity O
of O
its O
darkness O
, O
the O
most O
solemn O
prophecy O
which O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
has O
known O
of O
the O
Hope O
to O
come O
. O
I O
dare O
make O
my O
meaning O
no O
clearer O
, O
but O
will O
only O
tell O
my O
story O
. O
It O
will O
, O
perhaps O
, O
seem O
to O
you O
as O
foul O
and O
dark O
as O
this O
thick O
vapor O
about O
us O
, O
and O
as O
pregnant O
with O
death O
; O
but O
if O
your O
eyes O
are O
free O
as O
mine O
are O
to O
look O
deeper O
, O
no O
perfume-tinted O
dawn O
will O
be O
so O
fair O
with O
promise O
of O
the O
day O
that O
shall O
surely O
come O
. O
My O
story O
is O
very O
simple O
, O
-- O
Only O
what O
I O
remember O
of O
the O
life O
of O
one O
of O
these B-PER
men I-PER
, O
-- O
a O
furnace-tender B-FAC
in O
one O
of O
Kirby B-PER
& O
John B-PER
's O
rolling-mills O
, O
-- O
Hugh B-PER
Wolfe I-PER
. O
You O
know O
the B-FAC
mills I-FAC
? O
They O
took O
the O
great O
order O
for O
the O
lower O
Virginia B-GPE
railroads O
there B-FAC
last O
winter O
; O
run O
usually O
with O
about O
a B-PER
thousand I-PER
men I-PER
. O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
why O
I O
choose O
the O
half-forgotten O
story O
of O
this B-PER
Wolfe I-PER
more O
than O
that O
of O
myriads O
of O
these B-PER
furnace-hands I-PER
. O
Perhaps O
because O
there O
is O
a O
secret O
, O
underlying O
sympathy O
between O
that O
story O
and O
this O
day O
with O
its O
impure O
fog O
and O
thwarted O
sunshine O
, O
-- O
or O
perhaps O
simply O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
this B-FAC
house I-FAC
is O
the O
one O
where O
the B-PER
Wolfes I-PER
lived O
. O
There O
were O
the B-PER
father I-PER
and O
son B-PER
, O
-- O
both O
hands O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
in O
one O
of O
Kirby B-PER

John B-PER

mills O
for O
making O
railroad-iron O
, O
-- O
and O
Deborah B-PER
, O
their B-PER
cousin I-PER
, O
a O
picker O
in O
some O
of O
the B-FAC
cotton-mills I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
house I-FAC
was O
rented O
then O
to O
half B-PER
a I-PER
dozen I-PER
families I-PER
. O
The B-PER
Wolfes I-PER
had O
two B-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
cellar-rooms I-FAC
. O
The B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
, O
like O
many O
of O
the O
puddlers O
and O
feeders O
of O
the B-FAC
mills I-FAC
, O
was O
Welsh B-PER
, O
-- O
had O
spent O
half O
of O
his O
life O
in O
the B-FAC
Cornish I-FAC
tin-mines I-FAC
. O
You O
may O
pick O
the B-PER
Welsh I-PER
emigrants I-PER
, O
Cornish B-PER
miners I-PER
, O
out O
of O
the B-PER
throng I-PER
passing I-PER
the I-PER
windows I-PER
, O
any O
day O
. O
They O
are O
a O
trifle O
more O
filthy O
; O
their O
muscles O
are O
not O
so O
brawny O
; O
they O
stoop O
more O
. O
When O
they O
are O
drunk O
, O
they O
neither O
yell O
, O
nor O
shout O
, O
nor O
stagger O
, O
but O
skulk O
along O
like O
beaten O
hounds O
. O
A O
pure O
, O
unmixed O
blood O
, O
I O
fancy O
: O
shows O
itself O
in O
the B-PER
slight I-PER
angular I-PER
bodies I-PER
and O
sharply-cut O
facial O
lines O
. O
It O
is O
nearly O
thirty O
years O
since O
the B-PER
Wolfes I-PER
lived O
here B-FAC
. O
Their O
lives O
were O
like O
those O
of O
their B-PER
class I-PER
: O
incessant O
labor O
, O
sleeping O
in O
kennel-like B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
, O
eating O
rank O
pork O
and O
molasses O
, O
drinking O
-- O
God B-PER
and O
the B-PER
distillers I-PER
only O
know O
what O
; O
with O
an O
occasional O
night O
in O
jail B-FAC
, O
to O
atone O
for O
some O
drunken O
excess O
. O
Is O
that O
all O
of O
their O
lives O
? O
-- O
of O
the O
portion O
given O
to O
them O
and O
these O
their O
duplicates O
swarming O
the B-FAC
streets I-FAC
to-day O
? O
-- O
nothing O
beneath O
? O
-- O
all O
? O
So B-PER
many I-PER
a I-PER
political I-PER
reformer I-PER
will O
tell O
you O
, O
-- O
and O
many O
a O
private O
reformer O
, O
too O
, O
who O
has O
gone O
among O
them O
with O
a O
heart O
tender O
with O
Christ B-PER
's O
charity O
, O
and O
come O
out O
outraged O
, O
hardened O
. O
One O
rainy O
night O
, O
about O
eleven O
o'clock O
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
half-clothed B-PER
women I-PER
stopped O
outside O
of O
the B-FAC
cellar-door I-FAC
. O
They O
were O
going O
home B-FAC
from O
the B-FAC
cotton-mill I-FAC
. O
“ O
Good-night O
, O
Deb B-FAC
, O
” O
said O
one O
, O
a B-FAC
mulatto I-FAC
, O
steadying O
herself O
against O
the O
gas-post O
. O
She O
needed O
the O
post O
to O
steady O
her O
. O
So O
did O
more O
than O
one O
of O
them O
. O
“ O
Dah O

said O
a O
shrill O
Welsh O
voice O
in O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
. O
Two O
or O
three O
dirty O
hands O
were O
thrust O
out O
to O
catch O
the O
gown O
of O
the B-PER
woman I-PER

who O
was O
groping O
for O
the O

They O
went O
on O
, O
the B-PER
mulatto I-PER
inclining O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
show O
fight O
, O
and O
drag O
the B-PER
woman I-PER
Wolfe I-PER
off O
with O
them O
; O
but O
, O
being O
pacified O
, O
she O
staggered O
away O
. O
Deborah B-PER
groped O
her O
way O
into O
the B-FAC
cellar I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
after O
considerable O
stumbling O
, O
kindled O
a O
match O
, O
and O
lighted O
a O
tallow O
dip O
, O
that O
sent O
a O
yellow O
glimmer O
over O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
It O
was O
low O
, O
damp O
, O
-- O
the O
earthen O
floor O
covered O
with O
a O
green O
, O
slimy O
moss O
, O
-- O
a O
fetid O
air O
smothering O
the O

. O
Old B-PER
Wolfe I-PER
lay O
asleep O
on O
a O
heap O
of O
straw O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
torn O
horse-blanket O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
pale I-PER
, I-PER
meek I-PER
little I-PER
man I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
white I-PER
face I-PER
and I-PER
red I-PER
rabbit-eyes I-PER
. O
The O
woman B-PER
Deborah B-PER
was O
like O
him O
; O
only O
her O
face O
was O
even O
more O
ghastly O
, O
her O
lips O
bluer O
, O
her O
eyes O
more O
watery O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
faded O
cotton O
gown O
and O
a O
slouching O
bonnet O
. O
When O
she O
walked O
, O
one O
could O
see O
that O
she O
was O
deformed O
, O
almost O
a B-PER
hunchback I-PER
. O
She O
trod O
softly O
, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
waken O
him O
, O
and O
went O
through O
into O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
beyond I-FAC
. O
There O
she O
found O
by O
the O
half-extinguished O
fire O
an O
iron O
saucepan O
filled O
with O
cold O
boiled O
potatoes O
, O
which O
she O
put O
upon O
a O
broken O
chair O
with O
a O
pint-cup O
of O
ale O
. O
Placing O
the O
old O
candlestick O
beside O
this O
dainty O
repast O
, O
she O
untied O
her O
bonnet O
, O
which O
hung O
limp O
and O
wet O
over O
her O
face O
, O
and O
prepared O
to O
eat O
her O
supper O
. O
It O
was O
the O
first O
food O
that O
had O
touched O
her O
lips O
since O
morning O
. O
There O
was O
enough O
of O
it O
, O
however O
: O
there O
is O
not O
always O
. O
She O
was O
hungry O
, O
-- O
one O
could O
see O
that O
easily O
enough O
, O
-- O
and O
not O
drunk O
, O
as O
most B-PER
of I-PER
her I-PER
companions I-PER
would O
have O
been O
found O
at O
this O
hour O
. O
She O
did O
not O
drink O
, O
this B-PER
woman I-PER
, O
-- O
her O
face O
told O
that O
, O
too O
, O
-- O
nothing O
stronger O
than O
ale O
. O
Perhaps O
the B-PER
weak I-PER
, I-PER
flaccid I-PER
wretch I-PER
had O
some O
stimulant O
in O
her O
pale O
life O
to O
keep O
her O
up O
, O
-- O
some O
love O
or O
hope O
, O
it O
might O
be O
, O
or O
urgent O
need O
. O
When O
that O
stimulant O
was O
gone O
, O
she O
would O
take O
to O
whiskey O
. O
Man B-PER
can O
not O
live O
by O
work O
alone O
. O
While O
she O
was O
skinning O
the O
potatoes O
, O
and O
munching O
them O
, O
a O
noise O
behind O
her O
made O
her O
stop O

The B-PER
Maiden I-PER
I O
On O
an O
evening O
in O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
May O
a B-PER
middle-aged I-PER
man I-PER
was O
walking O
homeward O
from O
Shaston B-GPE
to O
the B-GPE
village I-GPE
of I-GPE
Marlott I-GPE
, O
in O
the B-LOC
adjoining I-LOC
Vale I-LOC
of I-LOC
Blakemore I-LOC
, O
or O
Blackmoor B-LOC
. O
The O
pair O
of O
legs O
that O
carried O
him O
were O
rickety O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
bias O
in O
his O
gait O
which O
inclined O
him O
somewhat O
to O
the O
left O
of O
a O
straight O
line O
. O
He O
occasionally O
gave O
a O
smart O
nod O
, O
as O
if O
in O
confirmation O
of O
some O
opinion O
, O
though O
he O
was O
not O
thinking O
of O
anything O
in O
particular O
. O
An O
empty O
egg-basket O
was O
slung O
upon O
his O
arm O
, O
the O
nap O
of O
his O
hat O
was O
ruffled O
, O
a O
patch O
being O
quite O
worn O
away O
at O
its O
brim O
where O
his O
thumb O
came O
in O
taking O
it O
off O
. O
Presently O
he O
was O
met O
by O
an B-PER
elderly I-PER
parson I-PER
astride I-PER
on I-PER
a I-PER
gray I-PER
mare I-PER
, O
who O
, O
as O
he O
rode O
, O
hummed O
a O
wandering O
tune O
. O
" O
Good O

said O
the B-PER
man I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER

The B-PER

after O
another O
pace O
or O
two O
, O
halted O
, O
and O
turned O
round O

" O
Now O

sir B-PER

begging O
your O

we O
met O

market-day O

I O
said O

after O
a O
moment O

hesitation O
: O

It O
was O
on O

you O

Durbeyfield B-PER

that O
you O
are O
the O
lineal O

it O

Throw O
up O

assisted O
the O

Branches B-PER

their O

in O
the O

of O
King B-PER
Stephen O

In O
the O
reign O
of O
King B-PER
John O
one B-PER
of I-PER
them I-PER
was O
rich O
enough O
to O
give O
a B-FAC

in O
Edward B-PER

Aye O
, O
there O
have O
been O
generations O
of O
Sir B-PER

among O
you O
, O
and O
if O

in O
old O

Ye O

concluded O
the B-PER

decisively O
smacking O
his O

there O

" O
said O
Durbeyfield B-PER

" O
And O
here O
have O
I O
been O
knocking O
about O

year O
after O
year O

from O

as O
if O
I O

no O
more O
than O
the O

And O
how O
long O
hev O
this O
news O
about O
me O
been O
knowed O
, O
Pa B-PER
' I-PER
son I-PER
Tringham I-PER

" O
The B-PER
clergyman I-PER
explained O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
was O
aware O
, O
it O
had O
quite O
died O
out O
of O
knowledge O
, O
and O
could O
hardly O
be O
said O
to O
be O
known O
at O
all O
. O
His O
own O
investigations O
had O
begun O
on O
a O
day O
in O
the O
preceding O
spring O
when O
, O
having O
been O
engaged O
in O
tracing O
the O
vicissitudes O
of O
the O
d'Urberville B-PER
family I-PER
, O
he O
had O
observed O
Durbeyfield B-PER

name O
on O
his B-VEH
waggon I-VEH
, O
and O
had O
thereupon O
been O
led O
to O
make O
inquiries O
about O
his B-PER
father I-PER
and O
grandfather B-PER
till O
he O
had O
no O
doubt O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
" O
At O
first O
I O
resolved O
not O
to O
disturb O
you O
with O
such O
a O
useless O
piece O
of O
information O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
However O
, O
our O
impulses O
are O
too O
strong O
for O
our O
judgement O
sometimes O

I O
thought O
you O
might O
perhaps O
know O
something O
of O
it O
all O
the O
while O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
't O
is O
true O
, O
that O
my B-PER
family I-PER
had O
seen O
better O
days O
afore O
they O
came O
to O
Blackmoor B-LOC
. O
But O
I O
took O
no O
notice O
o O
' O
t O
, O
thinking O
it O
to O
mean O
that O
we O
had O
once O
kept O
two O
horses O
where O
we O
now O
keep O
only O
one O
. O
I O
've O
got O
a O
wold O
silver O
spoon O

a O
wold O
graven O
seal O
at O
home B-FAC

, O
Lord O

what O

a O
spoon O

that O
I O

the B-PER

When O

Durbeyfield B-PER

a O
few O

down O
upon O

In O
a O
few O

a B-PER

walking O
in O
the O

had O
been O
pursued O
by O
Durbeyfield B-PER

The O
latter O
, O
on O
seeing O
him O
, O
held O
up O
his O

the B-PER

quickened O
his O
pace O

conferred O

The O
imbecility O

abroad I-PER

and O
the O
fatal O
want O

The O

When O

intelligence O

its O
truth O

The O
news O
had O

brought O

toward O
the O

a O
day O

by O
an O

It O
has O
already O
been O
mentioned O
that O
the O
distance O

less O

The B-FAC

had O
been O
widened O

so O
that O
the O
distance O
which O
had O
been O
traveled O
by O
the O
son O
of O
the B-LOC

two O

between O

summer O

The O
loyal O
servants O
of O
the B-GPE

The B-PER

the O

a O

a B-PER
few I-PER

a O
force O
really O
by O

with O
a O
body O

By O
uniting O
the B-ORG
several I-ORG
detachments I-ORG
of I-ORG
his I-ORG
command I-ORG
, O
this B-PER
officer I-PER
might O
have O
arrayed O
nearly O
double O
that O

the O

who O

ventured O
so O

with O
an B-ORG

but I-ORG
little I-ORG
superior I-ORG
in I-ORG
numbers I-ORG
. O
But O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
their O
degraded O
fortunes O
, O
both B-PER
officers I-PER
and O
men B-PER
appeared O
better O
disposed O
to O
await O
the O
approach O
of O
their B-PER
formidable I-PER
antagonists I-PER
, O
within O
their O
works O
, O
than O
to O
resist O
the O

the O

of O

After O
the O

of O
the O

had O
a O
little O
abated O

a O
rumor O
was O
spread O

The B-PER

flew O
from O

the O

while O
the B-PER
more I-PER

made O
his O
arrangements O
with O
a O
deliberation O
that O
scorned O
every O
appearance O

though O
his O
sober O

CHAPTER O
1 O
Mrs B-PER
Gildea O
had O
settled O
early O
to O
her O
morning O

work O
in O
what O
she O
called O
the O
veranda-study O
of O
her B-FAC
cottage I-FAC
in O
Leichardt B-GPE
's I-GPE
Town I-GPE
. O
It O
was O
a O
primitive O
cottage O
of O
the O
old O
style O
, O
standing O
in O
a B-FAC
garden I-FAC
and O
built O
on O
the B-LOC
cliff I-LOC
-- O
the B-LOC
Emu I-LOC
Point I-LOC
side O
-- O
overlooking O
the B-LOC
broad I-LOC
Leichardt I-LOC
River I-LOC
. O
The B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
, O
quite O
twelve O
feet O
wide O
, O
ran O
-- O
Australian O
fashion O
-- O
along O
the O
front O
of O
the B-FAC
cottage I-FAC
, O
except O
for O
the O
two O
closed-in O
ends O
forming O
, O
one O
a B-FAC
bathroom I-FAC
and O
the O
other O
a O
kind O
of O
store B-FAC
closet I-FAC
. O
Being O
raised O
a O
few O
feet O
above O
the O
ground O
, O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
was O
enclosed O
by O
a O
wooden O
railing O
, O
and O
this O
and O
the O
supporting O
posts O
were O
twined O
with O
creepers O
that O
must O
have O
been O
planted O
at O
least O
thirty O
years O
. O
One O
of O
these O
, O
a O
stephanotis O
, O
showed O
masses O
of O
white O
bloom O
, O
which O
Joan B-PER
Gildea I-PER
casually O
reflected O
would O
have O
fetched O
a O
pretty O
sum O
in O
Covent B-FAC
Garden I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
joining O
in O
with O
a O
fine-growing O
asparagus O
fern O
, O
formed O
an O
arch O
over O
the O
entrance O
steps O
. O
The O
end O
of O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
, O
where O
Mrs B-PER
Gildea O
had O
established O
herself O
with O
her O
type-writer O
and O
paraphernalia O
of O
literary O
work O
, O
was O
screened O
by O
a O
thick-stemmed O
grape-vine O
, O
which O
made O
a O
dapple O
of O
shadow O
and O
sunshine O
upon O
the O
boarded O
floor O
. O
Some O
bunches O
of O
late O
grapes O
-- O
it O
was O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
March O
-- O
hung O
upon O
the O
vine O
, O
and O
, O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
, O
grew O
a O
passion O
creeper O
, O
its O
great O
purple O
fruit O
looking O
like O
huge O
plums O
amidst O
its O
vivid O
green O
leaves O
. O
The O
roof O
of O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
was O
low O
, O
with O
projecting O
eaves O
, O
below O
which O
a O
bunch O
of O
yellowing O
bananas O
hung O
to O
ripen O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
and O
garden B-FAC
beyond O
would O
have O
been O
paradise O
to O
a O
fruitarian O
. O
Against O
the O
wall O
of O
the B-FAC
store-room I-FAC
, O
stood O
a O
large O
tin O
dish O
piled O
with O
melons O
, O
pine-apples O
and O
miscellaneous O
garden O
produce O
, O
while O
, O
between O
the O
veranda B-FAC
posts O
, O
could O
be O
seen O
a O
guava-tree O
, O
an O
elderly O
fig O
and O
a O
loquat O
all O
in O
full O
bearing O
. O
The B-FAC
garden I-FAC
seemed O
a O
tangle O
of O
all O
manner O
of O
vegetation O
-- O
an O
oleander O
in O
bloom O
, O
a O
poinsettia O

It O
had O
been O
an O
immense O
honour O
when O
Mr B-PER

had O
chosen O
Joan B-PER
Gildea I-PER
from O

for O
a O

Mr B-PER

decided O
that O
Imperialism O

his O
special O

immediate O
attention O

For O
this O
story O
dates O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
Mr B-PER

in O

when O
Imperialism O

THE B-PER
IMPERIALIST I-PER
's I-PER
Special I-PER
Correspondent I-PER
looked O
worried O
. O
She O
was O
wondering O
whether O
the O
English O
mail O
expected O
to-day O
would O
bring O
her O
troublesome O
editorial O
instructions O
. O
She O
examined O
some O
of O
the O
photographs O

drawings O
with O
a O
dissatisfied O
air O
. O
A O
running O
inarticulate O
commentary O
might O
have O
been O

into O
words O
like O
this O
: O

No O

I O

she O
went O
carefully O
through O

Mr B-PER

After O
him O

the O

its O

laid O
them O
out O
in O
learning O
navigation O
, O
and O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
mathematics O
, O
useful O
to O
those O
who O
intend O
to O
travel O
, O
as O
I O
always O
believed O
it O
would O
be O
, O
some O
time O
or O
other O
, O
my O
fortune O
to O
do O
. O
When O
I O
left O
Mr. B-PER
Bates O
, O
I O
went O
down O
to O
my B-PER
father I-PER
: O
where O
, O
by O
the O
assistance O
of O
him O
and O
my B-PER
uncle I-PER
John B-PER
, O
and O
some B-PER
other I-PER
relations I-PER
, O
I O
got O
forty O
pounds O
, O
and O
a O
promise O
of O
thirty O
pounds O
a O
year O
to O
maintain O
me O
at O
Leyden B-GPE
: O
there B-GPE
I O
studied O
physic O
two O
years O
and O
seven O
months O
, O
knowing O
it O
would O
be O
useful O
in O
long O
voyages O
. O
Soon O
after O
my O
return O
from O
Leyden B-GPE
, O
I O
was O
recommended O
by O
my B-PER
good I-PER
master I-PER
, O
Mr. B-PER
Bates O
, O
to O
be O
surgeon O
to O
the B-PER
Swallow I-PER
, O
Captain B-PER
Abraham O
Pannel O
, O
commander B-PER
; O
with O
whom O
I O
continued O
three O
years O
and O
a O
half O
, O
making O
a O
voyage O
or O
two O
into O
the B-LOC
Levant I-LOC
, O
and O
some B-LOC
other I-LOC
parts I-LOC
. O
When O
I O
came O
back O
I O
resolved O
to O
settle O
in O
London B-GPE
; O
to O
which O
Mr. B-PER
Bates O
, O
my B-PER
master I-PER
, O
encouraged O
me O
, O
and O
by O
him O
I O
was O
recommended O
to O
several B-PER
patients I-PER
. O
I O
took O
part O
of O
a O
small O
house O
in O
the B-FAC
Old I-FAC
Jewry I-FAC
; O
and O
being O
advised O
to O
alter O
my O
condition O
, O
I O
married O
Mrs. B-PER
Mary O
Burton O
, O
second O
daughter O
to O
Mr. B-PER
Edmund O
Burton O
, O
hosier B-PER
, O
in O
Newgate-street B-FAC
, O
with O
whom O
I O
received O
four O
hundred O
pounds O
for O
a O
portion O
. O
But O
my B-PER
good I-PER
master I-PER
Bates B-PER
dying O
in O
two O
years O
after O
, O
and O
I O
having O
few B-PER
friends I-PER
, O
my B-ORG
business I-ORG
began O
to O
fail O
; O
for O
my O
conscience O
would O
not O
suffer O
me O
to O
imitate O
the O
bad O
practice O
of O
too O
many O
among O
my B-PER
brethren I-PER
. O
Having O
therefore O
consulted O
with O
my B-PER
wife I-PER
, O
and O
some B-PER
of I-PER
my I-PER
acquaintance I-PER
, O
I O
determined O
to O
go O
again O
to O
sea B-LOC
. O
I O
was O
surgeon B-PER
successively O
in O
two B-VEH
ships I-VEH
, O
and O
made O
several O
voyages O
, O
for O
six O
years O
, O
to O
the B-LOC
East I-LOC
and I-LOC
West I-LOC
Indies I-LOC
, O
by O
which O
I O
got O
some O
addition O
to O
my O
fortune O
. O
My O
hours O
of O
leisure O
I O
spent O
in O
reading O
the B-PER
best I-PER
authors I-PER
, I-PER
ancient I-PER
and I-PER
modern I-PER
, O
being O
always O
provided O
with O
a O
good O
number O
of O
books O
; O
and O
when O
I O
was O
ashore O
, O
in O
observing O
the O
manners O
and O
dispositions O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
, O
as O
well O
as O
learning O
their O
language O
; O
wherein O
I O
had O
a O
great O
facility O
, O
by O
the O
strength O
of O
my O
memory O
. O
The O
last O
of O
these O
voyages O
not O
proving O
very O
fortunate O
, O
I O
grew O
weary O
of O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
and O
intended O
to O
stay O
at O
home B-FAC
with O
my B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
family B-PER
. O
I O
removed O
from O
the B-FAC
Old I-FAC
Jewry I-FAC
to O
Fetter B-FAC
Lane I-FAC
, O
and O
from O
thence O
to O
Wapping B-FAC
, O
hoping O
to O
get O
business O
among O
the B-PER
sailors I-PER
; O
but O
it O
would O
not O
turn O
to O
account O
. O
After O
three O
years O
expectation O
that O
things O
would O
mend O
, O
I O
accepted O
an O
advantageous O
offer O
from O
Captain B-PER
William O
Prichard O
, O
master B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
Antelope I-PER
, O
who O
was O
making O
a O
voyage O
to O
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
. O
We O
set O
sail O
from O
Bristol B-GPE
, O
May O
4 O
, O
1699 O
, O
and O
our O
voyage O
was O
at O
first O
very O
prosperous O
. O
It O
would O
not O
be O
proper O
, O
for O
some O
reasons O
, O
to O
trouble O
the B-PER
reader I-PER
with O
the O
particulars O
of O
our O
adventures O
in O
those B-LOC
seas I-LOC
; O
let O
it O
suffice O
to O
inform O
him O
, O
that O
in O
our O
passage O
from O
thence O
to O
the B-LOC
East I-LOC
Indies I-LOC
, O
we O
were O
driven O
by O
a O
violent O
storm O
to O
the O
north-west O
of O
Van B-GPE
Diemen I-GPE
’s I-GPE
Land I-GPE
. O
By O
an O
observation O
, O
we O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the B-LOC
latitude I-LOC
of I-LOC
30 I-LOC
degrees I-LOC
2 I-LOC
minutes I-LOC
south I-LOC
. O
Twelve B-PER
of I-PER
our I-PER
crew I-PER
were O
dead O
by O
immoderate O
labour O
and O
ill O
food O
; O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
were O
in O
a O
very O
weak O
condition O
. O
On O
the O
5th O
of O
November O
, O
which O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
summer O
in O
those B-LOC
parts I-LOC
, O
the O
weather O
being O
very O
hazy O
, O
the B-PER
seamen I-PER
spied O
a O
rock O
within O
half O
a O
cable O
’s O
length O
of O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
; O
but O
the O
wind O
was O
so O
strong O
, O
that O
we O
were O
driven O
directly O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
immediately O
split O
. O
Six B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
crew I-PER
, O
of O
whom O
I O
was O
one O
, O
having O
let O
down O
the B-VEH
boat I-VEH
into O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
made O
a O
shift O
to O
get O
clear O
of O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
and O
the O
rock O
. O
We O
rowed O
, O
by O
my O
computation O
, O
about O
three O
leagues O
, O
till O
we O
were O
able O
to O
work O
no O
longer O
, O
being O
already O
spent O
with O
labour O
while O
we O
were O
in O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
. O
We O
therefore O
trusted O
ourselves O
to O
the O
mercy O
of O
the O
waves O
, O
and O
in O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
the B-VEH
boat I-VEH
was O
overset O
by O
a O
sudden O
flurry O
from O
the O
north O
. O
What O
became O
of O
my O
companions O
in O
the B-VEH
boat I-VEH
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
those O
who O
escaped O
on O
the O
rock O
, O
or O
were O
left O
in O
the B-VEH
vessel I-VEH
, O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
; O
but O
conclude O
they O
were O
all O
lost O
. O
For O
my O
own O
part O
, O
I O
swam O
as O
fortune O
directed O
me O
, O
and O
was O
pushed O
forward O
by O
wind O
and O
tide O
. O
I O
often O
let O
my O
legs O
drop O
, O
and O
could O
feel O
no O
bottom O
; O
but O
when O
I O
was O
almost O
gone O
, O
and O
able O
to O
struggle O
no O
longer O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
within O
my O
depth O
; O
and O
by O
this O
time O
the O
storm O
was O
much O
abated O
. O
The B-LOC
declivity I-LOC
was O
so O
small O
, O
that O
I O
walked O
near O
a O
mile O
before O
I O
got O
to O
the B-LOC
shore I-LOC
, O
which O
I O
conjectured O
was O
about O
eight O
o’clock O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
I O
then O
advanced O
forward O
near O
half O
a O
mile O
, O
but O
could O
not O
discover O
any O
sign O
of O
houses B-FAC
or O
inhabitants B-PER
; O
at O
least O
I O
was O
in O
so O
weak O
a O
condition O
, O
that O
I O
did O
not O
observe O
them O
. O
I O
was O
extremely O
tired O
, O
and O
with O
that O
, O
and O
the O
heat O
of O
the O
weather O
, O
and O
about O
half O
a O
pint O
of O
brandy O
that O
I O
drank O
as O
I O
left O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
, O
I O
found O
myself O
much O
inclined O
to O
sleep O
. O
I O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
which O
was O
very O
short O
and O
soft O
, O
where O
I O
slept O
sounder O
than O
ever O
I O
remembered O
to O
have O
done O
in O
my O
life O
, O
and O
, O
as O
I O
reckoned O
, O
about O
nine O
hours O
; O
for O
when O
I O
awaked O
, O
it O
was O
just O
day-light O
. O
I O
attempted O
to O
rise O
, O
but O
was O
not O
able O
to O
stir O
: O
for O
, O
as O
I O
happened O
to O
lie O
on O
my O
back O
, O
I O
found O
my O
arms O
and O
legs O
were O
strongly O
fastened O
on O
each O
side O
to O
the O
ground O
; O
and O
my O
hair O
, O
which O
was O
long O
and O
thick O
, O
tied O
down O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
. O
I O
likewise O
felt O
several O
slender O
ligatures O
across O
my O
body O
, O
from O
my O
arm-pits O
to O
my O
thighs O
. O
I O
could O
only O
look O
upwards O
; O
the O
sun O
began O
to O
grow O
hot O
, O
and O
the O
light O
offended O
my O
eyes O
. O
I O
heard O
a O
confused O
noise O
about O
me O
; O
but O
in O
the O
posture O
I O
lay O
, O
could O
see O
nothing O
except O
the O
sky O
. O
In O
a O
little O
time O
I O
felt O
something O
alive O
moving O
on O
my O
left O
leg O
, O
which O
advancing O
gently O
forward O
over O
my O
breast O
, O
came O
almost O
up O
to O
my O
chin O
; O
when O
, O
bending O
my O
eyes O
downwards O
as O
much O
as O
I O
could O
, O
I O
perceived O
it O
to O
be O
a B-PER
human I-PER
creature I-PER
not I-PER
six I-PER
inches I-PER
high I-PER
, O
with O
a O
bow O
and O
arrow O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
a O
quiver O
at O
his O
back O
. O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
I O
felt O
at O
least O
forty B-PER
more I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
same I-PER
kind I-PER
( O
as O
I O
conjectured O
) O
following O
the O
first O
. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
utmost O
astonishment O
, O
and O
roared O
so O
loud O
, O
that O
they O
all O
ran O
back O
in O
a O
fright O
; O
and O
some O
of O
them O
, O
as O
I O
was O
afterwards O
told O
, O
were O
hurt O
with O
the O
falls O
they O
got O
by O
leaping O
from O
my O
sides O
upon O
the O
ground O
. O
However O
, O
they O
soon O
returned O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
, O
who O
ventured O
so O
far O
as O
to O
get O
a O
full O
sight O
of O
my O
face O
, O
lifting O
up O
his O
hands O
and O
eyes O
by O
way O
of O
admiration O
, O
cried O
out O
in O
a O
shrill O
but O
distinct O
voice O
, O
_ O
Hekinah O
degul O
_ O
: O
the O
others O
repeated O
the O
same O
words O
several O
times O
, O
but O
then O
I O
knew O
not O
what O
they O
meant O
. O
I O
lay O
all O
this O
while O
, O
as O
the B-PER
reader I-PER
may O
believe O
, O
in O
great O
uneasiness O
. O
At O
length O
, O
struggling O
to O
get O
loose O
, O
I O
had O
the O
fortune O
to O
break O
the O
strings O
, O
and O
wrench O
out O
the O
pegs O
that O
fastened O
my O
left O
arm O
to O
the O
ground O
; O
for O
, O
by O
lifting O
it O
up O
to O
my O
face O
, O
I O
discovered O
the O
methods O
they O
had O
taken O
to O
bind O
me O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
a O
violent O
pull O
, O
which O
gave O
me O
excessive O
pain O
, O
I O
a O
little O
loosened O
the O
strings O
that O
tied O
down O
my O
hair O
on O
the O
left O
side O
, O
so O
that O
I O
was O
just O
able O
to O
turn O
my O
head O
about O
two O
inches O
. O
But O
the O
creatures O
ran O
off O
a O
second O
time O
, O
before O
I O
could O
seize O
them O
; O
whereupon O
there O
was O
a O
great O
shout O
in O
a O
very O
shrill O
accent O
, O
and O
after O
it O
ceased O
I O
heard O
one O
of O
them O
cry O
aloud O
_ O
Tolgo O
phonac O
_ O
; O
when O
in O
an O
instant O
I O
felt O
above O
a O
hundred O
arrows O
discharged O
on O
my O
left O
hand O
, O
which O
, O
pricked O
me O
like O
so O
many O
needles O
; O
and O
besides O
, O
they O
shot O
another O
flight O
into O
the O
air O
, O
as O
we O
do O
bombs O
in O
Europe B-GPE
, O
whereof O
many O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
fell O
on O
my O
body O
, O
( O
though O
I O
felt O
them O
not O
) O
, O
and O
some O
on O
my O
face O
, O
which O
I O
immediately O
covered O
with O
my O
left O
hand O
. O
When O
this O
shower O
of O
arrows O
was O
over O
, O
I O
fell O
a O
groaning O
with O
grief O
and O
pain O
; O
and O
then O
striving O
again O
to O
get O
loose O
, O
they O
discharged O
another O
volley O
larger O
than O
the O
first O
, O
and O
some O
of O
them O
attempted O
with O
spears O
to O
stick O
me O
in O
the O
sides O
; O
but O
by O
good O
luck O
I O
had O
on O
a O
buff O
jerkin O
, O
which O
they O
could O
not O
pierce O
. O
I O
thought O
it O
the O
most O
prudent O
method O
to O
lie O
still O
, O
and O
my O
design O
was O
to O
continue O
so O
till O
night O
, O
when O
, O
my O
left O
hand O
being O
already O
loose O
, O
I O
could O
easily O
free O
myself O
: O
and O
as O
for O
the B-PER
inhabitants I-PER
, O
I O
had O
reason O
to O
believe O
I O
might O
be O
a O
match O
for O
the O
greatest O
army O
they O
could O
bring O
against O
me O
, O
if O
they O
were O
all O
of O
the O
same O
size O
with O
him O
that O
I O
saw O
. O
But O
fortune O
disposed O
otherwise O
of O
me O
. O
When O
the B-PER
people I-PER
observed O
I O
was O
quiet O
, O
they O
discharged O
no O
more O
arrows O
; O
but O
, O
by O
the O
noise O
I O
heard O
, O
I O
knew O
their O
numbers O
increased O
; O
and O
about O
four O
yards O
from O
me O
, O
over O
against O
my O
right O
ear O
, O
I O
heard O
a O
knocking O
for O
above O
an O
hour O
, O
like O
that O
of O
people B-PER
at O
work O
; O
when O
turning O
my O
head O
that O
way O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
pegs O
and O
strings O
would O
permit O
me O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
stage O
erected O
about O
a O
foot O
and O
a O
half O
from O
the O
ground O
, O
capable O
of O
holding O
four O
of O
the B-PER
inhabitants I-PER
, O
with O
two O
or O
three O
ladders O
to O
mount O
it O
: O
from O
whence O
one O
of O
them O
, O
who O
seemed O
to O
be O
a B-PER
person I-PER
of I-PER
quality I-PER
, O
made O
me O
a O
long O
speech O
, O
whereof O
I O
understood O
not O
one O
syllable O
. O
But O
I O
should O
have O
mentioned O
, O
that O
before O
the B-PER
principal I-PER
person I-PER
began O
his O
oration O
, O
he O
cried O
out O
three O
times O
, O
_ O
Langro O
dehul O
san O
_ O
( O
these O
words O
and O
the O
former O
were O
afterwards O
repeated O
and O
explained O
to O
me O
) O
; O
whereupon O
, O
immediately O
, O
about O
fifty O
of O
the B-PER
inhabitants I-PER
came O
and O
cut O
the O
strings O
that O
fastened O
the O
left O
side O
of O
my O
head O
, O
which O
gave O
me O
the O
liberty O
of O
turning O
it O
to O
the O
right O
, O
and O
of O
observing O
the B-PER
person I-PER
and O
gesture O
of O
him O
that O
was O
to O
speak O
. O
He O
appeared O
to O
be O
of O
a O
middle O
age O
, O
and O
taller O
than O
any O
of O
the O
other O
three O
who O
attended O
him O
, O
whereof O
one O
was O
a B-PER
page I-PER
that I-PER
held I-PER
up I-PER
his I-PER
train I-PER
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
somewhat O
longer O
than O
my O
middle O
finger O
; O
the O
other O
two O
stood O
one O
on O
each O
side O
to O
support O
him O
. O
He O
acted O
every O
part O
of O
an B-PER
orator I-PER
, O
and O
I O
could O
observe O
many O
periods O
of O
threatenings O
, O
and O
others O
of O
promises O
, O
pity O
, O
and O
kindness O
. O
I O
answered O
in O
a O
few O
words O
, O
but O
in O
the O
most O
submissive O
manner O
, O
lifting O
up O
my O
left O
hand O
, O
and O
both O
my O
eyes O
to O
the O
sun O
, O
as O
calling O
him O
for O
a B-PER
witness I-PER
; O
and O
being O
almost O
famished O
with O
hunger O
, O
having O
not O
eaten O
a O
morsel O
for O
some O
hours O
before O
I O
left O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
, O
I O
found O
the O
demands O
of O
nature O
so O
strong O
upon O
me O
, O
that O
I O
could O
not O
forbear O
showing O
my O
impatience O
( O
perhaps O
against O
the O
strict O
rules O
of O
decency O
) O
by O
putting O
my O
finger O
frequently O
to O
my O
mouth O
, O
to O
signify O
that O
I O
wanted O
food O
. O
The O
_ O
hurgo B-PER
_ O
( O
for O
so O
they O
call O
a B-PER
great I-PER
lord I-PER
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
learnt O
) O
understood O
me O
very O
well O
. O
He O
descended O
from O
the O
stage O
, O
and O
commanded O
that O
several O
ladders O
should O
be O
applied O
to O
my O
sides O
, O
on O
which O
above O
a O
hundred O
of O
the B-PER
inhabitants I-PER
mounted O
and O
walked O
towards O
my O
mouth O
, O
laden O
with O
baskets O
full O
of O
meat O
, O
which O
had O
been O
provided O
and O
sent O
thither O
by O
the B-PER
king I-PER
’s O
orders O
, O
upon O
the O
first O
intelligence O
he O
received O
of O
me O
. O
I O
observed O
there O
was O
the O
flesh O
of O
several O
animals O
, O
but O
could O
not O
distinguish O
them O
by O
the O
taste O
. O
There O
were O
shoulders O
, O
legs O
, O
and O
loins O
, O
shaped O
like O
those O
of O
mutton O
, O
and O
very O
well O
dressed O
, O
but O
smaller O
than O
the O
wings O
of O
a O
lark O
. O
I O
ate O
them O
by O
two O
or O
three O
at O
a O
mouthful O
, O
and O
took O
three O
loaves O
at O
a O
time O
, O
about O
the O
bigness O
of O
musket O
bullets O
. O
They O
supplied O
me O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
could O
, O
showing O
a O
thousand O
marks O
of O
wonder O
and O
astonishment O
at O
my O
bulk O
and O
appetite O
. O
I O
then O
made O
another O
sign O
, O
that O
I O
wanted O
drink O
. O
They O
found O
by O
my O
eating O
that O
a O
small O
quantity O
would O
not O
suffice O
me O
; O
and O
being O
a B-PER
most I-PER
ingenious I-PER
people I-PER
, O
they O
slung O
up O
, O
with O
great O
dexterity O
, O
one O
of O
their O
largest O
hogsheads O
, O
then O
rolled O
it O
towards O
my O
hand O
, O
and O
beat O
out O
the O
top O
; O
I O
drank O
it O
off O
at O
a O
draught O
, O
which O
I O
might O
well O
do O
, O
for O
it O
did O
not O
hold O
half O
a O
pint O
, O
and O
tasted O
like O
a O
small O
wine O
of O
Burgundy B-LOC
, O
but O
much O
more O
delicious O
. O
They O
brought O
me O
a O
second O
hogshead O
, O
which O
I O
drank O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
, O
and O
made O
signs O
for O
more O
; O
but O
they O
had O
none O
to O
give O
me O
. O
When O
I O
had O
performed O
these O
wonders O
, O
they O
shouted O
for O
joy O
, O
and O
danced O
upon O
my O
breast O
, O
repeating O
several O
times O
as O
they O
did O
at O
first O
, O
_ O
Hekinah O
degul O
_ O
. O
They O
made O
me O
a O
sign O
that O
I O
should O
throw O
down O
the O
two O
hogsheads O
, O
but O
first O
warning O
the B-PER
people I-PER
below I-PER
to O
stand O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
crying O
aloud O
, O
_ O
Borach O
mevolah O
_ O
; O
and O
when O
they O
saw O
the O
vessels O
in O
the O
air O
, O
there O
was O
a O
universal O
shout O
of O
_ O
Hekinah O
degul O
_ O
. O
I O
confess O
I O
was O
often O
tempted O
, O
while O
they O
were O
passing O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
on O
my O
body O
, O
to O
seize O
forty O
or O
fifty O
of O
the O
first O
that O
came O
in O
my O
reach O
, O
and O
dash O
them O
against O
the O
ground O
. O
But O
the O
remembrance O
of O
what O
I O
had O
felt O
, O
which O
probably O
might O
not O
be O
the O
worst O
they O
could O
do O
, O
and O
the O
promise O
of O
honour O
I O
made O
them O
— O
for O
so O
I O
interpreted O
my O
submissive O
behaviour O
— O
soon O
drove O
out O
these O
imaginations O
. O
Besides O
, O
I O
now O
considered O
myself O
as O
bound O
by O
the O
laws O
of O
hospitality O
, O
to O
a B-PER
people I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
treated I-PER
me I-PER
with I-PER
so I-PER
much I-PER
expense I-PER
and I-PER
magnificence I-PER
. O
However O
, O
in O
my O
thoughts O
I O
could O
not O
sufficiently O
wonder O
at O
the O
intrepidity O
of O
these B-PER
diminutive I-PER
mortals I-PER
, O
who O
durst O
venture O
to O
mount O
and O
walk O
upon O
my O
body O
, O
while O
one O
of O
my O
hands O
was O
at O
liberty O
, O
without O
trembling O
at O
the O
very O
sight O
of O
so B-PER
prodigious I-PER
a I-PER
creature I-PER
as O
I O
must O
appear O
to O
them O
. O
After O
some O
time O
, O
when O
they O
observed O
that O
I O
made O
no O
more O
demands O
for O
meat O
, O
there O
appeared O
before O
me O
a B-PER
person I-PER
of I-PER
high I-PER
rank I-PER
from I-PER
his I-PER
imperial I-PER
majesty I-PER
. O
His B-PER
excellency I-PER
, O
having O
mounted O
on O
the O
small O
of O
my O
right O
leg O
, O
advanced O
forwards O
up O
to O
my O
face O
, O
with O
about O
a B-PER
dozen I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
retinue I-PER
; O
and O
producing O
his O
credentials O
under O
the O
signet O
royal O
, O
which O
he O
applied O
close O
to O
my O
eyes O
, O
spoke O
about O
ten O
minutes O
without O
any O
signs O
of O
anger O
, O
but O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
determinate O
resolution O
, O
often O
pointing O
forwards O
, O
which O
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
found O
, O
was O
towards O
the B-GPE
capital I-GPE
city I-GPE
, O
about O
half O
a O
mile O
distant O
; O
whither O
it O
was O
agreed O
by O
his O
majesty O
in O
council O
that O
I O
must O
be O
conveyed O
. O
I O
answered O
in O
few O
words O
, O
but O
to O
no O
purpose O
, O
and O
made O
a O
sign O
with O
my O
hand O
that O
was O
loose O
, O
putting O
it O
to O
the O
other O
( O
but O
over O
his B-PER
excellency I-PER
’s O
head O
for O
fear O
of O
hurting O
him O
or O
his O
train O
) O
and O
then O
to O
my O
own O
head O
and O
body O
, O
to O
signify O
that O
I O
desired O
my O
liberty O
. O
It O
appeared O
that O
he O
understood O
me O
well O
enough O
, O
for O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
by O
way O
of O
disapprobation O
, O
and O
held O
his O
hand O
in O
a O
posture O
to O
show O
that O
I O
must O
be O
carried O
as O
a B-PER
prisoner I-PER
. O
However O
, O
he O
made O
other O
signs O
to O
let O
me O
understand O
that O
I O
should O
have O
meat O
and O
drink O
enough O
, O
and O
very O
good O
treatment O
. O
Whereupon O
I O
once O
more O
thought O
of O
attempting O
to O
break O
my O
bonds O
; O
but O
again O
, O
when O
I O
felt O
the O
smart O
of O
their O
arrows O
upon O
my O
face O
and O
hands O
, O
which O
were O
all O
in O
blisters O
, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
darts O
still O
sticking O
in O
them O
, O
and O
observing O
likewise O
that O
the O
number O
of O
my B-PER
enemies I-PER
increased O
, O
I O
gave O
tokens O
to O
let O
them O
know O
that O
they O
might O
do O
with O
me O
what O
they O
pleased O
. O
Upon O
this O
, O
the O
_ O
hurgo O
_ O
and O
his O
train O
withdrew O
, O
with O
much O
civility O
and O
cheerful O
countenances O
. O
Soon O
after O
I O
heard O
a B-PER
general I-PER
shout O
, O
with O
frequent O
repetitions O
of O
the O
words O
_ O
Peplom O
selan O
_ O
; O
and O
I O
felt O
great B-PER
numbers I-PER
of I-PER
people I-PER
on I-PER
my I-PER
left I-PER
side I-PER
relaxing O
the O
cords O
to O
such O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
turn O
upon O
my O
right O
, O
and O
to O
ease O
myself O
with O
making O
water O
; O
which O
I O
very O
plentifully O
did O
, O
to O
the O
great O
astonishment O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
; O
who O
, O
conjecturing O
by O
my O
motion O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
do O
, O
immediately O
opened O
to O
the O
right O
and O
left O
on O
that O
side O
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
torrent O
, O
which O
fell O
with O
such O
noise O
and O
violence O
from O
me O
. O
But O
before O
this O
, O
they O
had O
daubed O
my O
face O
and O
both O
my O
hands O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
ointment O
, O
very O
pleasant O
to O
the O
smell O
, O
which O
, O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
removed O
all O
the O
smart O
of O
their O
arrows O
. O
These O
circumstances O
, O
added O
to O
the O
refreshment O
I O
had O
received O
by O
their O
victuals O
and O
drink O
, O
which O
were O
very O
nourishing O
, O
disposed O
me O
to O
sleep O
. O
I O
slept O
about O
eight O
hours O
, O
as O
I O
was O
afterwards O
assured O
; O
and O
it O
was O
no O
wonder O
, O
for O
the B-PER
physicians I-PER
, O
by O
the B-PER
emperor I-PER
’s O
order O
, O
had O
mingled O
a O
sleepy O
potion O
in O
the O
hogsheads O
of O
wine O
. O

I O
might O

There O
was O
a O
shade O
of O

in O
the O
voice O
of O
Curtis B-PER
Waring I-PER
as O
he O
entered O
the B-FAC
library I-FAC
through O
the O
open O
door O

and O
approaching O
his B-PER
uncle I-PER

pressed O
his O
hand O

He O
was O
a B-PER
tall I-PER

dark-complexioned I-PER
man I-PER
, I-PER
of I-PER
perhaps I-PER
thirty-five I-PER

shifty I-PER

black I-PER
eyes I-PER

thin I-PER
lips I-PER

shaded I-PER

a I-PER
dark I-PER
mustache I-PER

when O
he O
smiled O
the O
expression O

his O
face O
did O
not O
soften O

he O
could O
moderate O
his O
voice O

the O
son O

Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
was O
startled O
. O
Generally O
at O
a B-FAC
pension I-FAC
people B-PER
looked O
them O
over O
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
before O
speaking O
, O
and O
often O
did O
not O
find O
out O
that O
they O
would O
“ O
do O
” O
till O
they O
had O
gone O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
the B-PER
intruder I-PER
was O
ill-bred O
, O
even O
before O
she O
glanced O
at O
him O
. O
He O
was O
an B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
, I-PER
of I-PER
heavy I-PER
build I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
fair I-PER
, I-PER
shaven I-PER
face I-PER
and I-PER
large I-PER
eyes I-PER
. O
There O
was O
something O
childish O
in O
those O
eyes O
, O
though O
it O
was O
not O
the O
childishness O
of O
senility O
. O
What O
exactly O
it O
was O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
consider O
, O
for O
her O
glance O
passed O
on O
to O
his O
clothes O
. O
These O
did O
not O
attract O
her O
. O
He O
was O
probably O
trying O
to O
become O
acquainted O
with O
them O
before O
they O
got O
into O
the O
swim O
. O
So O
she O
assumed O
a O
dazed O
expression O
when O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
, O
and O
then O
said O
: O
“ O
A O
view O
? O
Oh O
, O
a O
view O
! O
How O
delightful O
a O
view O
is O
! O
” O
“ O
This O
is O
my B-PER
son I-PER
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
; O
“ O
his O
name O
’s O
George B-PER
. O
He O
has O
a O
view O
too O
. O
” O
“ O
Ah O
, O
” O
said O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
, O
repressing O
Lucy B-PER
, O
who O
was O
about O
to O
speak O
. O
“ O
What O
I O
mean O
, O
” O
he O
continued O
, O
“ O
is O
that O
you O
can O
have O
our B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
, O
and O
we O
’ll O
have O
yours O
. O
We O
’ll O
change O
. O
” O
The O
better O
class O
of O
tourist B-PER
was O
shocked O
at O
this O
, O
and O
sympathized O
with O
the B-PER
new-comers I-PER
. O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
, O
in O
reply O
, O
opened O
her O
mouth O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
said O
“ O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
indeed O
; O
that O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O
” O
“ O
Why O
? O
” O
said O
the B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
, O
with O
both O
fists O
on O
the O
table O
. O
“ O
Because O
it O
is O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
thank O
you O
. O
” O
“ O
You O
see O
, O
we O
do O
n’t O
like O
to O
take O
-- O
” O
began O
Lucy B-PER
. O
Her B-PER
cousin I-PER
again O
repressed O
her O
. O
“ O
But O
why O
? O
” O
he O
persisted O
. O
“ O
Women B-PER
like O
looking O
at O
a O
view O
; O
men B-PER
do O
n’t O
. O
” O
And O
he O
thumped O
with O
his O
fists O
like O
a B-PER
naughty I-PER
child I-PER
, O
and O
turned O
to O
his B-PER
son I-PER
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
George B-PER
, O
persuade O
them O
! O
” O
“ O
It O
’s O
so O
obvious O
they O
should O
have O
the B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
son I-PER
. O
“ O
There O
’s O
nothing O
else O
to O
say O
. O
” O
He O
did O
not O
look O
at O
the B-PER
ladies I-PER
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
but O
his O
voice O
was O
perplexed O
and O
sorrowful O
. O
Lucy B-PER
, O
too O
, O
was O
perplexed O
; O
but O
she O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
in O
for O
what O
is O
known O
as O
“ O
quite O
a O
scene O
, O
” O
and O
she O
had O
an O
odd O
feeling O
that O
whenever O
these B-PER
ill-bred I-PER
tourists I-PER
spoke O
the O
contest O
widened O
and O
deepened O
till O
it O
dealt O
, O
not O
with O
rooms B-FAC
and O
views O
, O
but O
with O
-- O
well O
, O
with O
something O
quite O
different O
, O
whose O
existence O
she O
had O
not O
realized O
before O
. O
Now O
the B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
attacked O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
almost O
violently O
: O
Why O
should O
she O
not O
change O
? O
What O
possible O
objection O
had O
she O
? O
They O
would O
clear O
out O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
. O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
, O
though O
skilled O
in O
the O
delicacies O
of O
conversation O
, O
was O
powerless O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
brutality O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
snub O
any B-PER
one I-PER
so I-PER
gross I-PER
. O
Her O
face O
reddened O
with O
displeasure O
. O
She O
looked O
around O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
“ O
Are O
you O
all O
like O
this O
? O
” O
And O
two B-PER
little I-PER
old I-PER
ladies I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
sitting I-PER
further I-PER
up I-PER
the I-PER
table I-PER
, O
with O
shawls O
hanging O
over O
the O
backs O
of O
the O
chairs O
, O
looked O
back O
, O
clearly O
indicating O
“ O
We O
are O
not O
; O
we O
are O
genteel O
. O
” O
“ O
Eat O
your O
dinner O
, O
dear O
, O
” O
she O
said O
to O
Lucy B-PER
, O
and O
began O
to O
toy O
again O
with O
the O
meat O
that O
she O
had O
once O
censured O
. O
Lucy B-PER
mumbled O
that O
those O
seemed O
very B-PER
odd I-PER
people I-PER
opposite I-PER
. O
“ O
Eat O
your O
dinner O
, O
dear B-PER
. O
This B-FAC
pension I-FAC
is O
a O
failure O
. O
To-morrow O
we O
will O
make O
a O
change O
. O
” O
Hardly O
had O
she O
announced O
this O
fell O
decision O
when O
she O
reversed O
it O
. O
The O
curtains O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
parted O
, O
and O
revealed O
a B-PER
clergyman I-PER
, I-PER
stout I-PER
but I-PER
attractive I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
hurried I-PER
forward I-PER
to I-PER
take I-PER
his I-PER
place I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
table I-PER
, I-PER
cheerfully I-PER
apologizing I-PER
for I-PER
his I-PER
lateness I-PER
. O
Lucy B-PER
, O
who O
had O
not O
yet O
acquired O
decency O
, O
at O
once O
rose O
to O
her O
feet O
, O
exclaiming O
: O
“ O
Oh O
, O
oh O
! O
Why O
, O
it O
’s O
Mr. B-PER
Beebe O
! O
Oh O
, O
how O
perfectly O
lovely O
! O
Oh O
, O
Charlotte B-PER
, O
we O
must O
stop O
now O
, O
however O
bad O
the B-FAC
rooms I-FAC
are O
. O
Oh O
! O
” O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
said O
, O
with O
more O
restraint O
: O
“ O
How O
do O
you O
do O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Beebe O
? O
I O
expect O
that O
you O
have O
forgotten O
us O
: O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
and O
Miss B-PER
Honeychurch O
, O
who O
were O
at O
Tunbridge B-GPE
Wells I-GPE
when O
you O
helped O
the O
Vicar O
of O
St. B-ORG
Peter I-ORG
’s I-ORG
that O
very O
cold O

” O
The B-PER
clergyman I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
the I-PER
air I-PER
of I-PER
one I-PER
on I-PER
a I-PER
holiday I-PER
, O
did O
not O
remember O
the B-PER
ladies I-PER
quite O
as O
clearly O
as O
they O
remembered O
him O
. O
But O
he O
came O
forward O
pleasantly O
enough O
and O
accepted O
the O
chair O
into O
which O
he O
was O
beckoned O
by O
Lucy B-PER
. O
“ O
I O
AM O
so O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
in I-PER
a I-PER
state I-PER
of I-PER
spiritual I-PER
starvation I-PER
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
see O
the B-PER
waiter I-PER
if O
her B-PER
cousin I-PER
had O
permitted O
it O
. O
“ O
Just O
fancy O
how O
small O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
is O

“ O

the O
parish O
of O
Summer B-FAC

said O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
, O
filling O
up O
the O
gap O
, O
“ O
and O
she O
happened O
to O
tell O
me O
in O
the O
course O

“ O
Yes O

She O
did O
n’t O
know O

I O
knew O
you O
at O
Tunbridge B-GPE

; O
but O
I O
wrote O
back O
at O
once O

I O
said O
: O

“ O
Quite O
right O

said O
the B-PER
clergyman I-PER

“ O

move O
into O
the B-FAC
Rectory I-FAC

Mr. B-PER

bowed O

“ O
I O
am O
eating O
it O

thank O
you O

enjoying O

” O
He O
preferred O
to O
talk O
to O
Lucy B-PER
, O
whose O
playing O
he O
remembered O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
, O
who O
probably O
remembered O
his O
sermons O
. O
He O
asked O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
whether O
she O
knew O
Florence B-GPE
well O
, O
and O
was O
informed O
at O
some O
length O
that O
she O
had O
never O
been O
there B-GPE
before O
. O
It O
is O
delightful O
to O
advise O
a B-PER
newcomer I-PER
, O
and O
he O
was O
first O
in O
the O
field O
. O
“ O
Do O
n’t O
neglect O
the O
country O
round O
, O
” O
his O
advice O
concluded O
. O
“ O
The O
first O
fine O
afternoon O
drive O
up O
to O
Fiesole B-GPE

and O
round O
by O
Settignano B-GPE

or O
something O
of O

sort O

” O
“ O
No O

cried O
a O
voice O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
table O
. O
“ O
Mr. B-PER
Beebe O
, O
you O
are O
wrong O

your B-PER

“ O
That B-PER
lady I-PER
looks O
so O
clever O

whispered O
Miss B-PER
Bartlett O
to O
her B-PER
cousin I-PER
. O
“ O
We O
are O
in O
luck O
. O
” O
And O
, O
indeed O
, O
a O
perfect O
torrent O
of O
information O
burst O
on O
them O
. O
People B-PER
told O
them O
what O
to O
see O
, O
when O
to O
see O
it O
, O
how O
to O
stop O
the B-VEH
electric I-VEH

how O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the B-PER
beggars I-PER
, O
how O
much O
to O
give O
for O
a O
vellum O
blotter O
, O
how O
much O
the B-GPE
place I-GPE
would O
grow O
upon O
them O
. O
The B-FAC
Pension I-FAC
Bertolini I-FAC
had O
decided O

almost O
enthusiastically O
, O
that O
they O
would O
do O

Whichever O
way O
they O
looked O
, O
kind B-PER
ladies I-PER
smiled O
and O
shouted O
at O
them O

And O
above O
all O
rose O
the O
voice O
of O
the B-PER
clever I-PER
lady I-PER
, O
crying O
: O
“ O
Prato B-GPE
! O
They O
must O
go O
to O

That B-GPE

The O
young O
man O
named O

glanced O
at O
the B-PER
clever I-PER
lady I-PER
, O
and O
then O
returned O
moodily O
to O
his O
plate O

Obviously O
he O
and O
his B-PER
father I-PER
did O
not O
do O

Lucy B-PER
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
success O
, O
found O
time O
to O
wish O
they O
did O

It O
gave O
her O
no O
extra O
pleasure O
that O
any B-PER
one I-PER
should O
be O
left O
in O
the O
cold O
; O
and O
when O
she O
rose O
to O
go O

she O
turned O
back O
and O
gave O
the B-PER
two I-PER

a O
nervous O
little O
bow O

No B-PER

the O

that O
this B-LOC

being O

by O
intelligences O
greater O
than O
man B-PER

yet O
as O
mortal O
as O

that O
as O
men B-PER
busied O
themselves O
about O
their O
various O

they O
were O
scrutinised O

studied O
, O
perhaps O
almost O
as O
narrowly O
as O
a B-PER

with I-PER
a I-PER

might O
scrutinise O
the O
transient O
creatures O
that O
swarm O

multiply O
in O

With O
infinite O
complacency O
men B-PER
went O

serene O
in O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O

the O

No B-PER

gave O
a O
thought O
to O
the O
older O
worlds O
of O

of O

only O
to O

It O
is O
curious O
to O
recall O
some O
of O
the O
mental O
habits O
of O
those O
departed O

At O
most O
terrestrial B-PER
men I-PER
fancied O
there O

be O
other B-PER

upon O

perhaps O

early O

The B-LOC

all O
that O

Yet O
so O
vain O
is O
man B-PER
, O
and O
so O
blinded O
by O
his O
vanity O
, O
that O
no B-PER
writer I-PER
, O
up O
to O
the O
very O
end O
of O
the O
nineteenth O
century O
, O
expressed O
any O
idea O
that O
intelligent O
life O
might O
have O
developed O
there B-LOC
far O
, O
or O
indeed O
at O
all O
, O
beyond O
its O
earthly O
level O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
generally O
understood O
that O
since O
Mars B-LOC
is O
older O
than O
our B-LOC
earth I-LOC
, O
with O
scarcely O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
superficial O
area O
and O
remoter O
from O
the B-LOC
sun I-LOC
, O
it O
necessarily O
follows O
that O
it O
is O
not O
only O
more O
distant O
from O
time O
's O
beginning O
but O
nearer O
its O
end O
. O
The O
secular O
cooling O
that O
must O
someday O
overtake O
our B-LOC
planet I-LOC
has O
already O
gone O
far O
indeed O
with O
our B-LOC
neighbour I-LOC
. O
Its O
physical O
condition O
is O
still O
largely O
a O
mystery O
, O
but O
we O
know O
now O
that O
even O
in O
its O
equatorial O
region O
the O
midday O
temperature O
barely O
approaches O
that O
of O
our O
coldest O
winter O
. O
Its O
air O
is O
much O
more O
attenuated O
than O
ours O
, O
its B-LOC
oceans I-LOC
have O
shrunk O
until O
they O
cover O
but O
a O
third O
of O
its B-LOC
surface I-LOC
, O
and O
as O
its O
slow O
seasons O
change O
huge B-LOC
snowcaps I-LOC
gather O
and O
melt O
about O
either B-LOC
pole I-LOC
and O
periodically O
inundate O
its B-LOC
temperate I-LOC
zones I-LOC
. O
That O
last O
stage O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
which O
to O
us O
is O
still O
incredibly O
remote O
, O
has O
become O
a O
present-day O
problem O
for O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Mars B-LOC
. O
The O
immediate O
pressure O
of O
necessity O
has O
brightened O
their O
intellects O
, O
enlarged O
their O
powers O
, O
and O
hardened O
their O
hearts O
. O
And O
looking O
across O
space O
with O
instruments O
, O
and O
intelligences O
such O
as O
we O
have O
scarcely O
dreamed O
of O
, O
they O
see O
, O
at O
its O
nearest O
distance O
only O
35,000,000 O
of O
miles O
sunward O
of O
them O
, O
a B-LOC
morning I-LOC
star I-LOC
of I-LOC
hope I-LOC
, O
our O
own O
warmer O
planet O
, O
green O
with O
vegetation O
and O
grey O
with O
water O
, O
with O
a O
cloudy O
atmosphere O
eloquent O
of O
fertility O
, O
with O
glimpses O
through O
its O
drifting O
cloud O
wisps O
of O
broad O
stretches O
of O
populous B-LOC
country I-LOC
and O
narrow B-LOC
, I-LOC
navy-crowded I-LOC
seas I-LOC
. O
And O
we B-PER
men I-PER
, O
the O
creatures O
who O
inhabit O
this B-LOC
earth I-LOC
, O
must O
be O
to O
them O
at O
least O
as O
alien O
and O
lowly O
as O
are O
the O
monkeys O
and O
lemurs O
to O
us O
. O
The O
intellectual O
side O
of O
man B-PER
already O
admits O
that O
life O
is O
an O
incessant O
struggle O
for O
existence O
, O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
this O
too O
is O
the O
belief O
of O
the O
minds O
upon O
Mars B-LOC
. O
Their B-LOC
world I-LOC
is O
far O
gone O
in O
its O
cooling O
and O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
is O
still O
crowded O
with O
life O
, O
but O
crowded O
only O
with O
what O
they O
regard O
as O
inferior O
animals O
. O
To O
carry O
warfare O
sunward O
is O
, O
indeed O
, O
their O
only O
escape O
from O
the O
destruction O
that O
, O
generation O
after O
generation O
, O
creeps O
upon O
them O
. O
And O
before O
we O
judge O
of O
them O
too O
harshly O
we O
must O
remember O
what O
ruthless O
and O
utter O
destruction O
our B-PER
own I-PER
species I-PER
has O
wrought O
, O
not O
only O
upon O
animals O
, O
such O
as O
the O
vanished O
bison O
and O
the O
dodo O
, O
but O
upon O
its O
inferior O
races O
. O
The B-PER
Tasmanians I-PER
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
human B-PER
likeness O
, O
were O
entirely O
swept O
out O
of O
existence O
in O
a O
war O
of O
extermination O
waged O
by O
European B-PER
immigrants I-PER
, O
in O
the O
space O
of O
fifty O
years O
. O
Are O
we O
such B-PER
apostles I-PER
of I-PER
mercy I-PER
as O
to O
complain O
if O
the B-PER
Martians I-PER
warred O
in O
the O
same O
spirit O
? O
The B-PER
Martians I-PER
seem O
to O
have O
calculated O
their O
descent O
with O
amazing O
subtlety O
-- O
their O
mathematical O
learning O
is O
evidently O
far O
in O
excess O
of O
ours O
-- O
and O
to O
have O
carried O
out O
their O
preparations O
with O
a O
well-nigh O
perfect O
unanimity O
. O
Had O
our O
instruments O
permitted O
it O
, O
we O
might O
have O
seen O
the O
gathering O
trouble O
far O
back O
in O
the O
nineteenth O
century O
. O
Men O
like O
Schiaparelli B-PER
watched O
the O
red O
planet O
-- O
it O
is O
odd O
, O
by-the-bye O
, O
that O
for O
countless O
centuries O
Mars B-LOC
has O
been O
the B-LOC
star I-LOC
of I-LOC

-- O
but O
failed O

of O
the O

mapped O
so O
well O

All O
that O
time O
the B-PER

must O
have O
been O
getting O
ready O
. O
During O
the O
opposition O
of O
1894 O
a O
great O
light O
was O
seen O
on O
the O

part O
of O

first O
at O
the B-FAC

heard O
of O
it O
first O
in O
the O
issue O
of O
_ O

_ O
dated O
August O
2 O
. O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
this O
blaze O
may O
have O
been O
the O
casting O
of O
the O
huge O
gun O
, O
in O
the O
vast O
pit O
sunk O
into O
their O
planet O

from O
which O
their O
shots O
were O
fired O
at O
us O
. O
Peculiar O
markings O
, O
as O
yet O
unexplained O
, O
were O
seen O
near O
the B-LOC
site I-LOC
of I-LOC
that I-LOC
outbreak I-LOC
during O
the O
next O
two O
oppositions O
. O
The O
storm O
burst O
upon O
us O
six O
years O
ago O
now O
. O
As O
Mars B-LOC
approached O
opposition O
, O
Lavelle O
of O
Java B-GPE
set O
the O
wires O
of O
the O
astronomical O
exchange O
palpitating O
with O
the O
amazing O
intelligence O
of O
a O
huge O
outbreak O
of O
incandescent O
gas O
upon O
the O
planet O
. O
It O
had O
occurred O
towards O
midnight O
of O
the O
twelfth O
; O
and O
the O
spectroscope O
, O
to O
which O
he O
had O
at O
once O
resorted O
, O
indicated O
a O
mass O
of O
flaming O
gas O
, O
chiefly O
hydrogen O
, O
moving O
with O
an O
enormous O
velocity O
towards O
this B-LOC
earth I-LOC
. O
This O
jet O
of O
fire O
had O
become O
invisible O
about O
a O
quarter O
past O
twelve O
. O
He O
compared O
it O
to O
a O
colossal O
puff O
of O
flame O
suddenly O
and O
violently O
squirted O
out O
of O
the O
planet O
, O
" O
as O
flaming O
gases O
rushed O
out O
of O
a O
gun O
. O
" O
A O
singularly O
appropriate O
phrase O
it O
proved O
. O
Yet O
the O
next O
day O
there O
was O
nothing O
of O
this O
in O
the O
papers O
except O
a O
little O
note O
in O
the O
_ O
Daily O
Telegraph O
_ O
, O
and O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
went O
in O
ignorance O
of O
one O
of O
the O
gravest O
dangers O
that O
ever O
threatened O
the B-PER
human I-PER
race I-PER
. O
I O
might O
not O
have O
heard O
of O
the O
eruption O
at O
all O
had O
I O
not O
met O
Ogilvy B-PER
, O
the B-PER
well-known I-PER
astronomer I-PER
, O
at O
Ottershaw B-GPE
. O
He O
was O
immensely O
excited O
at O
the O
news O
, O
and O
in O
the O
excess O
of O
his O
feelings O
invited O
me O
up O
to O
take O
a O
turn O
with O
him O
that O
night O
in O
a O
scrutiny O
of O
the B-LOC
red I-LOC
planet I-LOC
. O
In O
spite O
of O
all O
that O
has O
happened O
since O
, O
I O
still O
remember O
that O
vigil O
very O
distinctly O
: O
the B-FAC
black I-FAC
and I-FAC
silent I-FAC
observatory I-FAC
, O
the O
shadowed O
lantern O
throwing O
a O
feeble O
glow O
upon O
the O
floor O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
the O
steady O
ticking O
of O
the O
clockwork O
of O
the O
telescope O
, O
the O
little O
slit O
in O
the O
roof O
-- O
an O
oblong O
profundity O
with O
the O
stardust O
streaked O
across O
it O
. O
Ogilvy B-PER
moved O
about O
, O
invisible O
but O
audible O
. O
Looking O
through O
the O
telescope O
, O
one O
saw O
a O
circle O
of O
deep O
blue O
and O
the B-LOC
little I-LOC
round I-LOC
planet I-LOC
swimming I-LOC
in I-LOC
the I-LOC
field I-LOC
. O
It O
seemed O
such O
a O
little O
thing O
, O
so O
bright O
and O
small O
and O
still O
, O
faintly O
marked O
with O
transverse O
stripes O
, O
and O
slightly O
flattened O
from O
the O
perfect O
round O
. O
But O
so O
little O
it O
was O
, O
so O
silvery O
warm O
-- O
a O
pin O
's O
- O
head O
of O
light O
! O
It O
was O
as O
if O
it O
quivered O
, O
but O
really O
this O
was O
the O
telescope O
vibrating O
with O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
clockwork O
that O
kept O
the B-LOC
planet I-LOC
in O
view O
. O
As O
I O
watched O
, O
the B-LOC
planet I-LOC
seemed O
to O
grow O
larger O
and O
smaller O
and O
to O
advance O
and O
recede O
, O
but O
that O
was O
simply O
that O
my O
eye O
was O
tired O
. O
Forty O
millions O
of O
miles O
it O
was O
from O
us O
-- O
more O
than O
forty O
millions O
of O
miles O
of O
void O
. O
Few B-PER
people I-PER
realise O
the O
immensity O
of O
vacancy O
in O
which O
the O
dust O
of O
the O
material O
universe O
swims O
. O
Near O
it O
in O
the B-LOC
field I-LOC
, O
I O
remember O
, O
were O
three B-LOC
faint I-LOC
points I-LOC
of I-LOC
light I-LOC
, O
three B-LOC
telescopic I-LOC
stars I-LOC
infinitely I-LOC
remote I-LOC
, O
and O
all O
around O
it O
was O
the O
unfathomable O
darkness O
of O
empty B-LOC
space I-LOC
. O
You O
know O
how O
that O
blackness O
looks O
on O
a O
frosty O
starlight O
night O
. O
In O
a O
telescope O
it O
seems O
far O
profounder O
. O
And O
invisible O
to O
me O
because O
it O
was O
so O
remote O
and O
small O
, O
flying O
swiftly O
and O
steadily O
towards O
me O
across O
that O
incredible O
distance O
, O
drawing O
nearer O
every O
minute O
by O
so O
many O
thousands O
of O
miles O
, O
came O
the O
Thing O
they O
were O
sending O
us O
, O
the O
Thing O
that O
was O
to O
bring O
so O
much O
struggle O
and O
calamity O
and O
death O
to O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
. O
I O
never O
dreamed O
of O
it O
then O
as O
I O
watched O
; O
no O
one O
on O
earth B-LOC
dreamed O
of O
that O
unerring O
missile O
. O
That O
night O
, O
too O
, O
there O
was O
another O
jetting O
out O
of O
gas O
from O
the B-LOC
distant I-LOC
planet I-LOC
. O
I O
saw O
it O
. O
A O
reddish O
flash O
at O
the O
edge O
, O
the O
slightest O
projection O
of O
the O
outline O
just O
as O
the O
chronometer O
struck O
midnight O
; O
and O
at O
that O
I O
told O
Ogilvy B-PER
and O
he O
took O
my O
place O
. O
The O
night O
was O
warm O
and O
I O
was O
thirsty O
, O
and O
I O
went O
stretching O
my O
legs O
clumsily O
and O
feeling O
my O
way O
in O
the O
darkness O
, O
to O
the O
little O
table O
where O
the O
siphon O
stood O
, O
while O
Ogilvy B-PER
exclaimed O
at O
the O
streamer O
of O
gas O
that O
came O
out O
towards O
us O
. O
That O
night O
another O
invisible O
missile O
started O
on O
its O
way O
to O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
from O
Mars B-LOC
, O
just O
a O
second O
or O
so O
under O
twenty-four O
hours O
after O
the O
first O
one O
. O
I O
remember O
how O
I O
sat O
on O
the O
table O
there O
in O
the O
blackness O
, O
with O
patches O
of O
green O
and O
crimson O
swimming O
before O
my O
eyes O
. O
I O
wished O
I O
had O
a O
light O
to O
smoke O
by O
, O
little O
suspecting O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
minute O
gleam O
I O
had O
seen O
and O
all O
that O
it O
would O
presently O
bring O
me O
. O
Ogilvy B-PER
watched O
till O
one O
, O
and O
then O
gave O
it O
up O
; O
and O
we O
lit O
the O
lantern O
and O
walked O
over O
to O
his B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
Down O
below O
in O
the O
darkness O
were O
Ottershaw B-GPE
and O
Chertsey B-GPE
and O
all B-PER
their I-PER
hundreds I-PER
of I-PER
people I-PER
, O
sleeping O
in O
peace O
. O
He O
was O
full O
of O
speculation O
that O
night O
about O
the O
condition O
of O
Mars B-LOC
, O
and O
scoffed O
at O
the O
vulgar O
idea O
of O
its O
having O
inhabitants B-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
signalling I-PER
us I-PER
. O
His O
idea O
was O
that O
meteorites O
might O
be O
falling O
in O
a O
heavy O
shower O
upon O
the B-LOC
planet I-LOC
, O
or O
that O
a O
huge O
volcanic O
explosion O
was O
in O
progress O
. O
He O
pointed O
out O
to O
me O
how O
unlikely O
it O
was O
that O
organic O
evolution O
had O
taken O
the O
same O
direction O
in O
the B-LOC
two I-LOC
adjacent I-LOC

In O

she O
returned O
to O
America B-GPE
, O
met O
Stephen B-PER

married O
him O

this O
almost O
entirely O
because O
she O
was O
a O
little O

a O
little O

Her B-PER
only I-PER
child I-PER

carried O

a O
tiresome O

brought O
into O
the B-LOC

a O

When O
Amory B-PER

five O
he O
was O
already O
a O
delightful O

He O
was O
an B-PER
auburn-haired I-PER
boy I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
great I-PER

handsome I-PER
eyes I-PER
which I-PER
he I-PER
would I-PER
grow I-PER
up I-PER

a I-PER
facile I-PER

a I-PER
taste I-PER

From O
his O
fourth O
to O
his O
tenth O

he O
did O
the B-LOC

his B-PER
mother I-PER
in O

from O

where O
his B-PER

she O
had O
a O

in O
a B-FAC
fashionable I-FAC

down O
to O
Mexico B-GPE
City I-GPE

where O
she O
took O
a O
mild O

almost O
epidemic O

This O
trouble O
pleased O
her O

Amory B-PER

look O
out O

at O

glibly O

rather O
reminiscently O

of O
Brahms B-PER

One O
afternoon O
, O
when O
left O
alone O
in O
the B-FAC
hotel I-FAC
at O
Hot B-GPE
Springs I-GPE

he O
sampled O
his B-PER
mother I-PER

apricot O

as O
the O
taste O
pleased O
him O

he O
became O
quite O
tipsy O

This O
was O
fun O
for O
a O

he O
essayed O
a O
cigarette O
in O
his O
exaltation O

to O
a O
vulgar O

Though O
this O
incident O
horrified O
Beatrice B-PER

it O
also O
secretly O

termed O
her O
“ O

“ O

he O
heard O
her O
tell O

awestruck B-PER

admiring I-PER

one O
day O
, O
“ O

” O
Her O
hand O
was O
radiantly O
outlined O
against O
her O
beautiful O
bosom O

then O
sinking O
her O
voice O
to O
a O
whisper O

she O
told O
them O
of O
the O
apricot O
cordial O

They O
rejoiced O
, O
for O
she O
was O
a B-PER
brave I-PER
raconteuse I-PER

but O
many O
were O
the O
keys O
turned O
in O
sideboard O
locks O
that O
night O
against O
the O
possible O
defection O
of O
little B-PER
Bobby I-PER

Barbara B-PER

. O
These O
domestic O
pilgrimages O
were O
invariably O
in O
state O

two B-PER
maids I-PER

the B-VEH
private I-VEH

Mr. B-PER
Blaine O
when O
available O

very O
often O
a O
physician B-PER

When O
Amory B-PER
had O
the O
whooping-cough O
four B-PER
disgusted I-PER
specialists I-PER
glared O
at O
each O

hunched O
around O
his O

when O
he O
took O
scarlet O
fever O
the O
number O
of O
attendants O

physicians B-PER

totalled O
fourteen O

However O
, O
blood O
being O
thicker O

he O
was O
pulled O
through O

The B-PER
Blaines I-PER
were O
attached O
to O
no B-GPE
city I-GPE
. O
They O
were O
the B-PER
Blaines I-PER
of O
Lake B-FAC
Geneva I-FAC

they O
had O
quite B-PER
enough I-PER
relatives I-PER
to O
serve O
in O
place O
of O
friends B-PER
, O
and O
an O
enviable O
standing O
from O
Pasadena B-GPE
to O
Cape B-GPE
Cod I-GPE
. O
But O
Beatrice B-PER
grew O
more O
and O
more O
prone O
to O
like O
only O
new B-PER
acquaintances I-PER
, O
as O
there O
were O
certain O
stories O
, O
such O
as O
the O
history O
of O
her O
constitution O
and O
its O
many O
amendments O
, O
memories O
of O
her O
years O
abroad O
, O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
for O
her O
to O
repeat O
at O
regular O
intervals O
. O
Like O
Freudian O
dreams O
, O
they O
must O
be O
thrown O
off O
, O
else O
they O
would O
sweep O
in O
and O
lay O
siege O
to O
her O
nerves O
. O
But O
Beatrice B-PER
was O
critical O
about O
American B-PER
women I-PER
, O
especially O
the B-PER
floating I-PER
population I-PER
of I-PER
ex-Westerners I-PER
. O
“ O
They O
have O
accents O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
” O
she O
told O
Amory B-PER
, O
“ O
not O
Southern O
accents O

Boston B-GPE
accents O

not O
an O
accent O
attached O
to O

just O
an O

-- O
she O
became O
dreamy O

“ O
They O
pick O
up O
old O

moth-eaten O
London B-GPE
accents O
that O
are O
down O

have O
to O
be O
used O
by O
some O
one O

They O
talk O
as O
an B-PER
English I-PER
butler I-PER
might O
after O
several O
years O
in O
a O
Chicago B-GPE
grand-opera O
company O

” O
She O
became O
almost O
incoherent O
-- O
“ O

time O
in O

try O

” O
Though O
she O
thought O
of O
her O
body O
as O
a O
mass O
of O
frailties O
, O
she O
considered O
her O
soul O
quite O
as O
ill O
, O
and O
therefore O
important O
in O
her O
life O
. O
She O
had O
once O
been O
a B-PER
Catholic I-PER
, O
but O
discovering O
that O
priests B-PER
were O
infinitely O
more O
attentive O
when O
she O
was O
in O
process O
of O
losing O
or O
regaining O
faith O
in O
Mother B-ORG
Church I-ORG
, O
she O
maintained O
an O
enchantingly O
wavering O
attitude O
. O
Often O
she O
deplored O
the O
bourgeois O
quality O
of O
the B-PER
American I-PER
Catholic I-PER
clergy I-PER
, O
and O
was O
quite O
sure O
that O
had O
she O
lived O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
great O
Continental O
cathedrals O
her O
soul O
would O
still O
be O
a O
thin O
flame O
on O
the O
mighty O
altar O
of O
Rome B-GPE
. O
Still O
, O
next O
to O
doctors B-PER
, O
priests B-PER
were O
her O
favorite O
sport O
. O
“ O
Ah O
, O
Bishop B-PER
Wiston I-PER
, O
” O
she O
would O
declare O
, O
“ O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
talk O
of O
myself O

I O
can O
imagine O
the O
stream O

hysterical B-PER
women I-PER
fluttering I-PER
at I-PER
your I-PER
doors I-PER

beseeching O
you O
to O
be O
simpatico O
” O
-- O
then O
after O
an O
interlude O
filled O
by O
the B-PER
clergyman I-PER
-- O
“ O
but O
my O
mood O
-- O
is O
-- O
oddly O
dissimilar O

” O
Only O
to O
bishops B-PER
and O
above O
did O
she O
divulge O
her O
clerical O
romance O
. O
When O
she O
had O
first O
returned O
to O
her B-GPE
country I-GPE
there O
had O
been O
a B-PER
pagan I-PER
, I-PER
Swinburnian I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
in O
Asheville B-GPE
, O
for O
whose O
passionate O
kisses O

unsentimental O
conversations O
she O
had O
taken O
a O
decided O

they O
had O
discussed O
the O
matter O
pro O

con O
with O
an O
intellectual O
romancing O
quite O
devoid O

Eventually O
she O
had O
decided O
to O
marry O
for O
background O
, O
and O
the O
young O
pagan O
from O
Asheville B-GPE
had O
gone O
through O
a O
spiritual O
crisis O

joined O
the B-ORG
Catholic I-ORG

“ O

Amory B-PER
became O
thirteen O

rather O
tall O
and O
slender O

and O
more O
than O
ever O
on O
to O
his B-PER
Celtic I-PER
mother I-PER

had O
tutored O

yet O
as O
no B-PER

ever O
found O
the O
place O
he O
left O
off O

his O
mind O
was O
still O
in O
very O
good O
shape O
. O
What O
a O
few O
more O
years O
of O
this O
life O
would O
have O
made O

In O

the B-PER
Lexicographer I-PER

always O
on O

lips O
of O
this B-PER
majestic I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
and O
a O
visit O
he O
had O
paid O
to O
her O

the O

commanded O
by O

Miss B-PER

When O

with O
rather O
a O
dubious O

" O
For O

Miss B-PER

said O
Miss B-PER
Pinkerton O
, O
with O
awful O
coldness O
. O
" O
For O
Becky B-PER
Sharp I-PER
, O
" O
answered O
Jemima B-PER
, O
trembling O
very O
much O
, O
and O
blushing O
over O
her O
withered O
face O

neck O
, O
as O
she O
turned O
her O
back O
on O
her B-PER
sister I-PER

Sharp I-PER
: O
she O

going O
too O

" O
" O
MISS B-PER
JEMIMA O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Miss B-PER
Pinkerton O
, O
in O
the O
largest O
capitals O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
in O
your O
senses O
? O
Replace O
the O
Dixonary O
in O
the B-FAC

liberty O
in O

" O
" O
Well O
, O
sister B-PER
, O
it O

only O
two-and-ninepence O
, O
and O
poor B-PER
Becky I-PER
will O
be O
miserable O
if O
she O
do O

get O
one O
. O
" O
" O
Send O
Miss B-PER
Sedley O
instantly O
to O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Miss B-PER
Pinkerton O
. O
And O
so O
venturing O
not O
to O
say O
another O
word O
, O
poor B-PER
Jemima I-PER
trotted O
off O
, O
exceedingly O
flurried O
and O
nervous O
. O
Miss B-PER
Sedley O
's O
papa O
was O
a O
merchant O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
and O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
some I-PER
wealth I-PER
; O
whereas O
Miss B-PER
Sharp O
was O
an B-PER
articled I-PER
pupil I-PER
, O
for O
whom O
Miss B-PER
Pinkerton O
had O
done O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
, O
quite O
enough O
, O
without O
conferring O
upon O
her O
at O
parting O
the O
high O
honour O
of O
the O
Dixonary O
. O
Although O
schoolmistresses B-PER
' O
letters O
are O
to O
be O
trusted O
no O
more O
nor O
less O
than O
churchyard B-FAC
epitaphs O
; O
yet O
, O
as O
it O
sometimes O
happens O
that O
a B-PER
person I-PER
departs O
this O
life O
who O
is O
really O
deserving O
of O
all O
the O
praises O
the B-PER
stone I-PER
cutter I-PER
carves O
over O
his O
bones O
; O
who O
IS O
a B-PER
good I-PER
Christian I-PER
, O
a B-PER
good I-PER
parent I-PER
, O
child B-PER
, O
wife B-PER
, O
or O
husband B-PER
; O
who O
actually O
DOES O
leave O
a B-PER
disconsolate I-PER
family I-PER
to O
mourn O
his O
loss O
; O
so O
in O
academies B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
male I-ORG
and I-ORG
female I-ORG
sex I-ORG
it O
occurs O
every O
now O
and O
then O
that O
the B-PER
pupil I-PER
is O
fully O
worthy O
of O
the O
praises O
bestowed O
by O
the B-PER
disinterested I-PER
instructor I-PER
. O
Now O
, O
Miss B-PER
Amelia O
Sedley O
was O
a B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
of I-PER
this I-PER
singular I-PER
species I-PER
; O
and O
deserved O
not O
only O
all O
that O
Miss B-PER
Pinkerton O
said O
in O
her O
praise O
, O
but O
had O
many O
charming O
qualities O
which O
that O
pompous O
old O
Minerva O
of O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
could O
not O
see O
, O
from O
the O
differences O
of O
rank O
and O
age O
between O
her B-PER
pupil I-PER
and O
herself O
. O
For O
she O
could O
not O
only O
sing O
like O
a O
lark O
, O
or O
a O
Mrs. B-PER
Billington O
, O
and O
dance O
like O
Hillisberg B-PER
or O
Parisot B-PER
; O
and O
embroider O
beautifully O
; O
and O
spell O
as O
well O
as O
a O
Dixonary O
itself O
; O
but O
she O
had O
such O
a O
kindly O
, O
smiling O
, O
tender O
, O
gentle O
, O
generous O
heart O
of O
her O
own O
, O
as O
won O
the O
love O
of O
everybody B-PER
who I-PER
came I-PER
near I-PER
her I-PER
, O
from O
Minerva B-PER
herself O
down O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
in O
the B-FAC
scullery I-FAC
, O
and O
the B-PER
one-eyed I-PER
tart-woman I-PER
's O
daughter O
, O
who O
was O
permitted O
to O
vend O
her O
wares O
once O
a O
week O
to O
the O
young O
ladies O
in O
the B-FAC
Mall I-FAC
. O
She O
had O
twelve B-PER
intimate I-PER
and I-PER
bosom I-PER
friends I-PER
out O
of O
the B-PER
twenty-four I-PER
young I-PER
ladies I-PER
. O
Even O
envious B-PER
Miss I-PER
Briggs I-PER
never O
spoke O
ill O
of O
her O
; O
high O
and O
mighty O
Miss B-PER
Saltire O
( O
Lord B-PER
Dexter O
's O
granddaughter O
) O
allowed O
that O
her O
figure O
was O
genteel O
; O
and O
as O
for O
Miss B-PER
Swartz O
, O
the O
rich O
woolly-haired O
mulatto O
from O
St. B-PER
Kitt O
's O
, O
on O
the O
day O
Amelia B-PER
went O
away O
, O
she O
was O
in O
such O
a O
passion O
of O
tears O
that O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
send O
for O
Dr. B-PER
Floss O
, O
and O
half O
tipsify O
her O
with O
salvolatile O
. O
Miss B-PER
Pinkerton O
's O
attachment O
was O
, O
as O
may O
be O
supposed O
from O
the O
high O
position O
and O
eminent O
virtues O
of O
that B-PER
lady I-PER
, O
calm O
and O
dignified O
; O
but O
Miss B-PER
Jemima O
had O
already O
whimpered O
several O
times O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Amelia B-PER
's O
departure O
; O
and O
, O
but O
for O
fear O
of O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
, O
would O
have O
gone O
off O
in O
downright O
hysterics O
, O
like O
the O
heiress O
( O
who O
paid O
double O
) O
of O
St. B-GPE
Kitt I-GPE
's I-GPE
. O
Such O
luxury O
of O
grief O
, O
however O
, O
is O
only O
allowed O
to O
parlour-boarders B-PER
. O
Honest B-PER
Jemima I-PER
had O
all O
the O
bills O
, O
and O
the O
washing O
, O
and O
the O
mending O
, O
and O
the O
puddings O
, O
and O
the O
plate O
and O
crockery O
, O
and O
the O
servants B-PER
to O
superintend O
. O
But O
why O
speak O
about O
her O
? O
It O
is O
probable O
that O
we O
shall O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
again O
from O
this O
moment O
to O
the O
end O
of O
time O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
great O
filigree O
iron O
gates O
are O
once O
closed O
on O
her O
, O
she O
and O
her B-PER
awful I-PER
sister I-PER
will O
never O
issue O
therefrom O
into O
this O
little O
world O
of O
history O
. O
But O
as O
we O
are O
to O
see O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
Amelia B-PER
, O
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
saying O
, O
at O
the O
outset O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
she O
was O
a B-PER
dear I-PER
little I-PER
creature I-PER
; O
and O
a O
great O
mercy O
it O
is O
, O
both O
in O
life O
and O
in O
novels O
, O
which O
( O
and O
the O
latter O
especially O
) O
abound O
in O
villains B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
most I-PER
sombre I-PER
sort I-PER
, O
that O
we O
are O
to O
have O
for O
a B-PER
constant I-PER
companion I-PER
so I-PER
guileless I-PER
and I-PER
good-natured I-PER
a I-PER
person I-PER
. O
As O
she O
is O
not O
a B-PER
heroine I-PER
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
describe O
her B-PER
person I-PER
; O
indeed O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
her O
nose O
was O
rather O
short O
than O
otherwise O
, O
and O
her O
cheeks O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
round O
and O
red O
for O
a B-PER
heroine I-PER
; O
but O
her O
face O
blushed O
with O
rosy O
health O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
with O
the O
freshest O
of O
smiles O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes O
which O
sparkled O
with O
the O
brightest O
and O
honestest O
good-humour O
, O
except O
indeed O
when O
they O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
that O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
often O
; O
for O
the O
silly O
thing O
would O
cry O
over O

CHAPTER O
I O
RAGGED B-PER
DICK I-PER
IS O
INTRODUCED O
TO O
THE B-PER
READER I-PER
" O
Wake O
up O
there O
, O
youngster B-PER
, O
" O
said O
a B-PER
rough I-PER
voice I-PER
. O
Ragged B-PER
Dick I-PER
opened O
his O
eyes O
slowly O
, O
and O
stared O
stupidly O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the B-PER
speaker I-PER
, O
but O
did O
not O
offer O
to O
get O
up O
. O
" O
Wake O
up O
, O
you B-PER
young I-PER
vagabond I-PER
! O
" O
said O
the B-PER
man I-PER
a O
little O
impatiently O
; O
" O
I O
suppose O
you O
'd O
lay O
there O
all O
day O
, O
if O
I O
had O
n't O
called O
you O
. O
" O
" O
What O
time O
is O
it O
? O
" O
asked O
Dick B-PER
. O
" O
Seven O
o'clock O
. O
" O
" O
Seven O
o'clock O
! O
I O
oughter O
've O
been O
up O
an O
hour O
ago O
. O
I O
know O
what O
't O
was O
made O
me O
so O
precious O
sleepy O
. O
I O
went O
to O
the B-FAC
Old I-FAC
Bowery I-FAC
last O
night O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
turn O
in O
till O
past O
twelve O
. O
" O
" O
You O
went O
to O
the B-FAC
Old I-FAC
Bowery I-FAC
? O
Where O
'd O
you O
get O
your O
money O
? O
" O
asked O
the B-PER
man I-PER
, O
who O
was O
a O
porter O
in O
the O
employ O
of O
a O
firm O
doing O
business O
on O
Spruce B-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O
" O
Made O
it O
by O
shines O
, O
in O
course O
. O
My B-PER
guardian I-PER
do O
n't O
allow O
me O
no O
money O
for O
theatres B-FAC
, O
so O
I O
have O
to O
earn O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Some B-PER
boys I-PER
get O
it O
easier O
than O
that O
, O
" O
said O
the B-PER
porter I-PER
significantly O
. O
" O
You O
do O
n't O
catch O
me O
stealin O
' O
, O
if O
that O
's O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
" O
said O
Dick B-PER
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
you O
ever O
steal O
, O
then O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
. O
Lots B-PER
of I-PER
boys I-PER
does O
it O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
glad O
to O
hear O
you O
say O
that O
. O
I O
believe O
there O
's O
some O
good O
in O
you O
, O
Dick O
, O
after O
all O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
a B-PER
rough I-PER
customer I-PER
! O
" O
said O
Dick B-PER
. O
" O
But O
I O
would O
n't O
steal O
. O
It O
's O
mean O
. O
" O
" O
I O
'm O
glad O
you O
think O
so O
, O
Dick B-PER
, O
" O
and O
the B-PER
rough I-PER
voice I-PER
sounded O
gentler O
than O
at O
first O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
got O
any O
money O
to O
buy O
your O
breakfast O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
soon O
get O
some O
. O
" O
While O
this O
conversation O
had O
been O
going O
on O
, O
Dick B-PER
had O
got O
up O
. O
His B-FAC
bedchamber I-FAC
had O
been O
a O
wooden O
box O
half O
full O
of O
straw O
, O
on O
which O
the B-PER
young I-PER
boot-black I-PER
had O
reposed O
his O
weary O
limbs O
, O
and O
slept O
as O
soundly O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
a O
bed O
of O
down O
. O
He O
dumped O
down O
into O
the O
straw O
without O
taking O
the O
trouble O
of O
undressing O
. O
Getting O
up O
too O
was O
an O
equally O
short O
process O
. O
He O
jumped O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
box I-FAC
, O
shook O
himself O
, O
picked O
out O
one O
or O
two O
straws O
that O
had O
found O
their O
way O
into O
rents O
in O
his O
clothes O
, O
and O
, O
drawing O
a O
well-worn O
cap O
over O
his O
uncombed O
locks O
, O
he O
was O
all O
ready O
for O
the O
business O
of O
the O
day O
. O
Dick B-PER
's O
appearance O
as O
he O
stood O
beside O
the B-FAC
box I-FAC
was O
rather O
peculiar O
. O
His O
pants O
were O
torn O
in O
several O
places O
, O
and O
had O
apparently O
belonged O
in O
the O
first O
instance O
to O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
two I-PER
sizes I-PER
larger I-PER
than I-PER
himself I-PER
. O
He O
wore O
a O
vest O
, O
all O
the O
buttons O
of O
which O
were O
gone O
except O
two O
, O
out O
of O
which O
peeped O
a O
shirt O
which O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
worn O
a O
month O
. O
To O
complete O
his O
costume O
he O
wore O
a O
coat O
too O
long O
for O
him O
, O
dating O
back O
, O
if O
one O
might O
judge O
from O
its O
general O
appearance O
, O
to O
a O
remote O
antiquity O
. O
Washing O
the O
face O
and O
hands O
is O
usually O
considered O
proper O
in O
commencing O
the O
day O
, O
but O
Dick B-PER
was O
above O
such O
refinement O
. O
He O
had O
no O
particular O
dislike O
to O
dirt O
, O
and O
did O
not O
think O
it O
necessary O
to O
remove O
several O
dark O
streaks O
on O
his O
face O
and O
hands O
. O
But O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
dirt O
and O
rags O
there O
was O
something O
about O
Dick B-PER
that O
was O
attractive O
. O
It O
was O
easy O
to O
see O
that O
if O
he O
had O
been O
clean O
and O
well O
dressed O
he O
would O
have O
been O
decidedly O
good-looking O
. O
Some B-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
companions I-PER
were O
sly O
, O
and O
their O
faces O
inspired O
distrust O
; O
but O
Dick B-PER
had O
a O
frank O
, O
straight-forward O
manner O
that O
made O
him O
a O
favorite O
. O
Dick B-PER
's O
business O
hours O
had O
commenced O
. O
He O
had O
no O
office B-FAC
to O
open O
. O
His B-FAC
little I-FAC
blacking-box I-FAC
was O
ready O
for O
use O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
sharply O
in O
the O
faces O
of O
all B-PER
who I-PER
passed I-PER
, O
addressing O
each O
with O
, O
" O
Shine O
yer O
boots O
, O
sir B-PER
? O
" O
" O
How O
much O
? O
" O
asked O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
on O
his O
way O
to O
his B-FAC
office I-FAC
. O
" O
Ten O
cents O
, O
" O
said O
Dick B-PER
, O
dropping O
his B-FAC
box I-FAC
, O
and O
sinking O
upon O
his O
knees O
on O
the B-FAC
sidewalk I-FAC
, O
flourishing O
his O
brush O
with O
the O
air O
of O
one B-FAC
skilled I-FAC
in I-FAC
his I-FAC
profession I-FAC
. O
" O
Ten O
cents O
! O
Is O
n't O
that O
a O
little O
steep O
? O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
' O
taint O
all O
clear O
profit O
, O
" O
said O
Dick B-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
already I-PER
set I-PER
to I-PER
work I-PER
. O
" O
There O
's O
the O
_ O
blacking O
_ O
costs O
something O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
get O
a O
new O
brush O
pretty O
often O
. O
" O
" O
And O
you O
have O
a O
large O
rent O
too O
, O
" O
said O
the B-PER
gentleman I-PER
quizzically O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
at O
a O
large O
hole O
in O
Dick B-PER
's O
coat O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
" O
said O
Dick B-PER
, O
always O
ready O
to O
joke O
; O
" O
I O
have O
to O
pay O
such O
a O
big O
rent O
for O
my O
manshun O
up O
on O
Fifth B-FAC
Avenoo I-FAC
, O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
take O
less O
than O
ten O
cents O
a O
shine O
. O
I O
'll O
give O
you O
a O
bully O
shine O
, O
sir B-PER
. O
" O
" O
Be O
quick O
about O
it O
, O
for O
I O
am O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
So O
your B-FAC
house I-FAC
is O
on O
Fifth B-FAC
Avenue I-FAC
, O
is O
it O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
n't O
anywhere O
else O
, O
" O
said O
Dick B-PER
, O
and O
Dick B-PER
spoke O
the O
truth O
there O
. O
" O
What O
tailor B-PER
do O
you O
patronize O
? O
" O
asked O
the B-PER
gentleman I-PER
, O
surveying O
Dick B-PER
's O
attire O
. O
" O
Would O
you O
like O
to O
go O
to O
the O
same O
one O
? O
" O
asked O
Dick B-PER
, O
shrewdly O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
no O
; O
it O
strikes O
me O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
give O
you O
a O
very O
good O
fit O
. O
" O
" O
This O
coat O
once O
belonged O
to O
General B-PER
Washington O
, O
" O
said O
Dick B-PER
, O
comically O
. O
" O
He O
wore O
it O
all O
through O
the O
Revolution O
, O
and O
it O
got O
torn O
some O
, O
'cause O
he O
fit O
so O
hard O
. O
When O
he O
died O
he O
told O
his B-PER
widder I-PER
to O
give O
it O
to O
some B-PER
smart I-PER
young I-PER
feller I-PER
that I-PER
had I-PER
n't I-PER
got I-PER
none I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
own I-PER
; O
so O
she O
gave O
it O
to O
me O
. O
But O
if O
you O
'd O
like O
it O
, O
sir B-PER
, O
to O
remember O
General B-PER
Washington O
by O
, O
I O
'll O
let O
you O
have O
it O
reasonable O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
deprive O
you O
of O
it O
. O
And O
did O
your O
pants O
come O
from O
General B-PER
Washington O
too O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
they O
was O
a O
gift O
from O
Lewis B-PER
Napoleon I-PER
. O
Lewis B-PER
had O
outgrown O
'em O
and O
sent O
'em O
to O
me O
, O
-- O
he O
's O
bigger O
than O
me O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
they O
do O
n't O
fit O
. O
" O
" O
It O
seems O
you O
have O
distinguished B-PER
friends I-PER
. O
Now O
, O
my B-PER
lad I-PER
, O
I O
suppose O
you O
would O

your O
money O

" O
I O
should O

any O
objection O

said O
Dick B-PER
. O
" O
I O

said O
the B-PER
gentleman I-PER
, O
examining O
his O
pocket-book O

" O
I O

anything O

wonder O

the O

" O
Mr. B-PER
Greyson O
did O
n't O
understand O
Dick B-PER
. O
Our B-PER
ragged I-PER
hero I-PER
was O
n't O
a B-PER
model I-PER
boy I-PER
in O
all O
respects O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
he O
swore O
sometimes O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
he O
played O
tricks O
upon O
unsophisticated O
boys O
from O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
or O
gave O
a O
wrong O
direction O
to O
honest O
old O
gentlemen O
unused O
to O
the B-GPE
city I-GPE
. O
A O
clergyman O
in O
search O
of O
the B-FAC
Cooper I-FAC
Institute I-FAC
he O
once O
directed O
to O
the B-FAC
Tombs I-FAC
Prison I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
following O
him O
unobserved O
, O
was O
highly O
delighted O
when O
the B-PER
unsuspicious I-PER
stranger I-PER
walked O
up O
the O
front O
steps O
of O
the O
great O
stone O
building O
on O
Centre B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
and O
tried O
to O
obtain O
admission O
. O
" O
I O
guess O
he O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
stay O
long O
if O
he O
did O
get O
in O
, O
" O
thought O
Ragged B-PER
Dick I-PER
, O
hitching O
up O
his O
pants O
. O
" O
Leastways O
I O
should O

They O
're O

you O

gratooitous O
, O
and O
never O
send O

no O

" O
Another O
of O
Dick B-PER
's O
faults O
was O
his O
extravagance O
. O
Being O
always O
wide-awake O
and O
ready O
for O
business O
, O
he O
earned O
enough O
to O
have O
supported O
him O
comfortably O
and O
respectably O
. O
There O
were O
not O
a B-PER
few I-PER
young I-PER
clerks I-PER
who O
employed O
Dick B-PER
from O
time O
to O
time O
in O
his O
professional O
capacity O
, O
who O
scarcely O
earned O
as O
much O
as O
he O
, O
greatly O
as O
their O
style O
and O
dress O
exceeded O
his O
. O
But O
Dick B-PER
was O
careless O
of O
his O
earnings O
. O
Where O
they O
went O
he O
could O
hardly O
have O
told O
himself O
. O
However O
much O
he O
managed O
to O
earn O
during O
the O
day O
, O
all O
was O
generally O
spent O
before O
morning O
. O
He O
was O
fond O
of O
going O
to O
the B-FAC
Old I-FAC
Bowery I-FAC
Theatre I-FAC
, O
and O
to O
Tony B-PER
Pastor I-PER
's O
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
any O
money O
left O
afterwards O
, O
he O
would O
invite O
some B-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
friends I-PER
in O
somewhere O
to O
have O
an O
oyster-stew O
; O
so O
it O
seldom O
happened O
that O
he O
commenced O
the O
day O
with O
a O
penny O
. O
Then O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
add O
that O
Dick B-PER
had O
formed O
the O
habit O
of O
smoking O
. O
This O
cost O
him O
considerable O
, O
for O
Dick B-PER
was O
rather O
fastidious O
about O
his O
cigars O
, O
and O
would O
n't O
smoke O
the O
cheapest O
. O
Besides O
, O
having O
a O
liberal O
nature O
, O
he O
was O
generally O
ready O
to O
treat O
his B-PER
companions I-PER
. O
But O
of O
course O
the O
expense O
was O
the O
smallest O
objection O
. O
No B-PER
boy I-PER
of I-PER
fourteen I-PER
can O
smoke O
without O
being O
affected O
injuriously O
. O
Men B-PER
are O
frequently O
injured O
by O
smoking O
, O
and O
boys B-PER
always O
. O
But O
large B-PER
numbers I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
newsboys I-PER
and I-PER
boot-blacks I-PER
form O
the O
habit O
. O
Exposed O
to O
the O
cold O
and O
wet O
they O
find O
that O
it O
warms O
them O
up O
, O
and O
the O
self-indulgence O
grows O
upon O
them O
. O
It O
is O
not O
uncommon O
to O
see O
a B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
too O
young O
to O
be O
out O
of O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
sight O
, O
smoking O
with O
all O
the O
apparent O
satisfaction O
of O
a B-PER
veteran I-PER
smoker I-PER
. O
There O
was O
another O
way O
in O
which O
Dick B-PER
sometimes O
lost O
money O
. O
There O
was O
a O
noted O
gambling-house O
on O
Baxter B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
which O
in O
the O
evening O
was O
sometimes O
crowded O
with O
these B-PER
juvenile I-PER
gamesters I-PER
, O
who O
staked O
their O
hard O
earnings O
, O
generally O
losing O
of O
course O
, O
and O
refreshing O
themselves O
from O
time O
to O
time O
with O
a O
vile O
mixture O
of O
liquor O
at O
two O
cents O
a O
glass O
. O
Sometimes O
Dick B-PER
strayed O
in O
here B-FAC
, O
and O
played O
with O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
. O
I O
have O
mentioned O
Dick B-PER
's O
faults O
and O
defects O
, O
because O
I O
want O
it O
understood O
, O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
consider O
him O
a B-PER
model I-PER
boy I-PER
. O
But O
there O
were O
some O
good O
points O
about O
him O
nevertheless O
. O
He O
was O
above O
doing O
anything O
mean O
or O
dishonorable O
. O
He O
would O
not O
steal O
, O
or O
cheat O
, O
or O
impose O
upon O
younger B-PER
boys I-PER
, O
but O
was O
frank O
and O
straight-forward O
, O
manly O
and O
self-reliant O
. O
His O
nature O
was O
a O
noble O
one O
, O
and O
had O
saved O
him O
from O
all O
mean O
faults O
. O
I O
hope O
my B-PER
young I-PER
readers I-PER
will O
like O
him O
as O
I O
do O
, O
without O
being O
blind O
to O
his O
faults O
. O
Perhaps O
, O
although O
he O
was O
only O
a B-PER
boot-black I-PER
, O
they O
may O
find O
something O
in O
him O
to O
imitate O
. O
CHAPTER O
I O
' O
HASTE O
TO O
THE O
WEDDING O
' O
' O
Wooed O
and O
married O
and O
a O
' O
. O
' O
' O
Edith B-PER
! O
' O
said O
Margaret B-PER
, O
gently O
, O
' O
Edith B-PER
! O
' O
But O
, O
as O
Margaret B-PER
half O
suspected O
, O
Edith B-PER
had O
fallen O
asleep O
. O
She O
lay O
curled O
up O
on O
the O
sofa O
in O
the B-FAC
back I-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
in O
Harley B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
looking O
very O
lovely O
in O
her O
white O
muslin O
and O
blue O
ribbons O
. O
If O
Titania B-PER
had O
ever O
been O
dressed O
in O
white O
muslin O
and O
blue O
ribbons O
, O
and O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
on O
a O
crimson O
damask O
sofa O
in O
a B-FAC
back I-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
, O
Edith B-PER
might O
have O
been O
taken O
for O
her O
. O
Margaret B-PER
was O
struck O
afresh O
by O
her B-PER
cousin I-PER
's O
beauty O
. O
They O
had O
grown O
up O
together O
from O
childhood O
, O
and O
all O
along O
Edith B-PER
had O
been O
remarked O
upon O
by O
every B-PER
one I-PER
, O
except O
Margaret B-PER
, O
for O
her O
prettiness O
; O
but O
Margaret B-PER
had O
never O
thought O
about O
it O
until O
the O
last O
few O
days O
, O
when O
the O
prospect O
of O
soon O
losing O
her B-PER
companion I-PER
seemed O
to O
give O
force O
to O
every O
sweet O
quality O
and O
charm O
which O
Edith B-PER
possessed O
. O
They O
had O
been O
talking O
about O
wedding O
dresses O
, O
and O
wedding O
ceremonies O
; O
and O
Captain B-PER
Lennox O
, O
and O
what O
he O
had O
told O
Edith B-PER
about O
her O
future O
life O
at O
Corfu B-GPE
, O
where O
his O
regiment O
was O
stationed O
; O
and O
the O
difficulty O
of O
keeping O
a O
piano O
in O
good O
tune O
( O
a O
difficulty O
which O
Edith B-PER
seemed O
to O
consider O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
formidable O
that O
could O
befall O
her O
in O
her O
married O
life O
) O
, O
and O
what O
gowns O
she O
should O
want O
in O
the O
visits O
to O
Scotland B-GPE
, O
which O
would O
immediately O
succeed O
her O
marriage O
; O
but O
the O
whispered O
tone O
had O
latterly O
become O
more O
drowsy O
; O
and O
Margaret B-PER
, O
after O
a O
pause O
of O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
found O
, O
as O
she O
fancied O
, O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
buzz O
in O
the B-FAC
next I-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
Edith B-PER
had O
rolled O
herself O
up O
into O
a O
soft O
ball O
of O
muslin O
and O
ribbon O
, O
and O
silken O
curls O
, O
and O
gone O
off O
into O
a O
peaceful O
little O
after-dinner O
nap O
. O
Margaret B-PER
had O
been O
on O
the O
point O
of O
telling O
her B-PER
cousin I-PER
of O
some O
of O
the O
plans O
and O
visions O
which O
she O
entertained O
as O
to O
her O
future O
life O
in O
the O
country O
parsonage O
, O
where O
her B-PER
father I-PER
and O
mother B-PER
lived O
; O
and O
where O
her O
bright O
holidays O
had O
always O
been O
passed O
, O
though O
for O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
her B-PER
aunt I-PER
Shaw B-PER
's O
house O
had O
been O
considered O
as O
her B-FAC
home I-FAC
. O
But O
in O
default O
of O
a B-PER
listener I-PER
, O
she O
had O
to O
brood O
over O
the O
change O
in O
her O
life O
silently O
as O
heretofore O
. O
It O
was O
a O
happy O
brooding O
, O
although O
tinged O
with O
regret O
at O
being O
separated O
for O
an O
indefinite O
time O
from O
her B-PER
gentle I-PER
aunt I-PER
and O
dear B-PER
cousin I-PER
. O
As O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
delight O
of O
filling O
the O
important O
post O
of O
only O
daughter O
in O
Helstone B-FAC
parsonage I-FAC
, O
pieces O
of O
the O
conversation O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
next I-FAC
room I-FAC
came O
upon O
her O
ears O
. O
Her B-PER
aunt I-PER
Shaw B-PER
was O
talking O
to O
the O
five O
or O
six O
ladies O
who O
had O
been O
dining O
there B-FAC
, O
and O
whose B-PER
husbands I-PER
were O
still O
in O
the B-FAC
dining-room I-FAC
. O
They O
were O
the O
familiar O
acquaintances O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
; O
neighbours O
whom O
Mrs. B-PER
Shaw O
called O
friends B-PER
, O
because O
she O
happened O
to O
dine O
with O
them O
more O
frequently O
than O
with O
any B-PER
other I-PER
people I-PER
, O
and O
because O
if O
she O
or O
Edith B-PER
wanted O
anything O
from O
them O
, O
or O
they O
from O
her O
, O
they O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
make O
a O
call O
at O
each B-PER
other I-PER
's O
houses O
before O
luncheon O
. O
These B-PER
ladies I-PER
and O
their B-PER
husbands I-PER
were O
invited O
, O
in O
their O
capacity O
of O
friends B-PER
, O
to O
eat O
a O
farewell O
dinner O
in O
honour O
of O
Edith B-PER
's O
approaching O
marriage O
. O
Edith B-PER
had O
rather O
objected O
to O
this O
arrangement O
, O
for O
Captain B-PER
Lennox O
was O
expected O
to O
arrive O
by O
a B-VEH
late I-VEH
train I-VEH
this O
very O
evening O
; O
but O
, O
although O
she O
was O
a B-PER
spoiled I-PER
child I-PER
, O
she O
was O
too O
careless O
and O
idle O
to O
have O
a O
very O
strong O
will O
of O
her O
own O
, O
and O
gave O
way O
when O
she O
found O
that O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
absolutely O
ordered O
those O
extra O
delicacies O
of O
the O
season O
which O
are O
always O
supposed O
to O
be O
efficacious O
against O
immoderate O
grief O
at O
farewell O
dinners O
. O
She O
contented O
herself O
by O
leaning O
back O
in O
her O
chair O
, O
merely O
playing O
with O
the O
food O
on O
her O
plate O
, O
and O
looking O
grave O
and O
absent O
; O
while O
all O
around O
her O
were O
enjoying O
the O
mots O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Grey O
, O
the O
gentleman O
who O
always O
took O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
table O
at O
Mrs. B-PER
Shaw O
's O
dinner O
parties O
, O
and O
asked O
Edith B-PER
to O
give O
them O
some O
music O
in O
the B-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
. O
Mr. B-PER
Grey O
was O
particularly O
agreeable O
over O
this O
farewell O
dinner O
, O
and O
the B-PER
gentlemen I-PER
staid O
down O
stairs B-FAC
longer O
than O
usual O
. O
It O
was O
very O
well O
they O
did O
-- O
to O
judge O
from O
the O
fragments O
of O
conversation O
which O
Margaret B-PER
overheard O
. O
' O
I O
suffered O
too O
much O
myself O
; O
not O
that O
I O
was O
not O
extremely O
happy O
with O
the B-PER
poor I-PER
dear I-PER
General I-PER
, O
but O
still O
disparity O
of O
age O
is O
a O
drawback O
; O
one O
that O
I O
was O
resolved O
Edith B-PER
should O
not O
have O
to O
encounter O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
without O
any O
maternal O
partiality O
, O
I O
foresaw O
that O
the B-PER
dear I-PER
child I-PER
was O
likely O
to O
marry O
early O
; O
indeed O
, O
I O
had O
often O
said O
that O
I O
was O
sure O
she O
would O
be O
married O
before O
she O
was O
nineteen O
. O
I O
had O
quite O
a O
prophetic O
feeling O
when O
Captain B-PER
Lennox O
' O
-- O
and O
here O
the O
voice O
dropped O
into O
a O
whisper O
, O
but O
Margaret B-PER
could O
easily O
supply O
the O
blank O
. O
The O
course O
of O
true O
love O
in O
Edith B-PER
's O
case O
had O
run O
remarkably O
smooth O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Shaw O
had O
given O
way O
to O
the O
presentiment O
, O
as O
she O
expressed O
it O
; O
and O
had O
rather O
urged O
on O
the O
marriage O
, O
although O
it O
was O
below O
the O
expectations O
which O
many O
of O
Edith B-PER
's O
acquaintances O
had O
formed O
for O
her O
, O
a B-PER
young I-PER
and I-PER
pretty I-PER
heiress I-PER
. O
But O
Mrs. B-PER
Shaw O
said O
that O
her B-PER
only I-PER
child I-PER
should O
marry O
for O
love O
, O
-- O
and O
sighed O
emphatically O
, O
as O
if O
love O
had O
not O
been O
her O
motive O
for O
marrying O
the B-PER
General I-PER
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Shaw O
enjoyed O
the O
romance O
of O
the O
present O
engagement O
rather O
more O
than O
her B-PER
daughter I-PER
. O
Not O
but O
that O
Edith B-PER
was O
very O
thoroughly O
and O
properly O
in O
love O
; O
still O
she O
would O
certainly O
have O
preferred O
a O
good O
house O
in O
Belgravia B-GPE
, O
to O
all O
the O
picturesqueness O
of O
the O
life O
which O
Captain B-PER
Lennox O
described O
at O
Corfu B-GPE
. O
The O
very O
parts O
which O
made O
Margaret B-PER
glow O
as O
she O
listened O
, O
Edith B-PER
pretended O
to O
shiver O
and O
shudder O
at O
; O
partly O
for O
the O
pleasure O
she O
had O
in O
being O
coaxed O
out O
of O
her O
dislike O
by O
her B-PER
fond I-PER
lover I-PER
, O
and O
partly O
because O
anything O
of O
a O
gipsy O
or O
make-shift O
life O
was O
really O
distasteful O
to O
her O
. O
Yet O
had O
any B-PER
one I-PER
come O
with O
a B-FAC
fine I-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
and O
a B-FAC
fine I-FAC
estate I-FAC
, O
and O
a O
fine O
title O
to O
boot O
, O
Edith B-PER
would O
still O
have O
clung O
to O
Captain B-PER
Lennox O
while O
the O
temptation O
lasted O
; O
when O
it O
was O
over O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
she O
might O
have O
had O
little O
qualms O
of O
ill-concealed O
regret O
that O
Captain B-PER
Lennox O
could O
not O
have O
united O
in O
his B-PER
person I-PER
everything O
that O
was O
desirable O
. O
In O
this O
she O
was O
but O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
child O
; O
who O
, O
after O
deliberately O
marrying O
General B-PER
Shaw O
with O
no O
warmer O
feeling O
than O
respect O
for O
his O
character O
and O
establishment O
, O
was O
constantly O
, O
though O
quietly O
, O
bemoaning O
her O
hard O
lot O
in O
being O
united O
to O
one B-PER
whom I-PER
she I-PER
could I-PER
not I-PER
love I-PER
. O
' O
I O
have O
spared O
no O
expense O
in O
her O
trousseau O
, O
' O
were O
the O
next O
words O
Margaret B-PER
heard O
. O
' O
She O
has O
all O
the O
beautiful O
Indian O
shawls O
and O
scarfs O
the B-PER
General I-PER
gave O
to O
me O
, O
but O
which O
I O
shall O
never O
wear O
again O
. O
' O
' O
She O
is O
a B-PER
lucky I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
' O
replied O
another O
voice O
, O
which O
Margaret B-PER
knew O
to O
be O
that O
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Gibson O
, O
a B-PER
lady I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
taking I-PER
a I-PER
double I-PER
interest I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
conversation I-PER
, O
from O
the O
fact O
of O
one O
of O
her B-PER
daughters I-PER
having O
been O
married O
within O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
. O
' O
Helen B-PER
had O
set O
her O
heart O
upon O
an O
Indian O
shawl O
, O
but O
really O
when O
I O
found O
what O
an O
extravagant O
price O
was O
asked O
, O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
refuse O
her O
. O
She O
will O
be O
quite O
envious O
when O
she O
hears O
of O
Edith B-PER
having O
Indian O
shawls O
. O
What O
kind O
are O
they O
? O
Delhi B-GPE
? O
with O
the O
lovely O
little O
borders O
? O
' O
Margaret B-PER
heard O
her B-PER
aunt I-PER
's O
voice O
again O
, O
but O
this O
time O
it O
was O
as O
if O
she O
had O
raised O
herself O
up O
from O
her O
half-recumbent O
position O
, O
and O
were O
looking O
into O
the B-FAC
more I-FAC
dimly I-FAC
lighted I-FAC
back I-FAC
drawing-room I-FAC
. O
' O
Edith B-PER
! O
Edith B-PER
! O
' O
cried O
she O
; O
and O
then O
she O
sank O
as O
if O
wearied O
by O
the O
exertion O
. O
Margaret B-PER
stepped O
forward O
. O
' O
Edith B-PER
is O
asleep O
, O
Aunt B-PER
Shaw O
. O
Is O
it O
anything O
I O
can O
do O
? O
' O
All B-PER
the I-PER
ladies I-PER
said O
' O
Poor B-PER
child I-PER
! O
' O
on O
receiving O
this O
distressing O
intelligence O
about O
Edith O
; O
and O
the O
minute O
lap-dog O
in O
Mrs. B-PER
Shaw O
's O
arms O
began O
to O
bark O
, O
as O
if O
excited O
by O
the O
burst O
of O
pity O
. O
' O
Hush O
, O
Tiny O
! O
you O
naughty O
little B-PER
girl I-PER
! O
you O
will O
waken O
your B-PER
mistress I-PER
. O
It O
was O
only O
to O
ask O
Edith B-PER
if O
she O
would O
tell O
Newton B-PER
to O
bring O
down O
her O
shawls O
: O
perhaps O
you O
would O
go O
, O
Margaret B-PER
dear O
? O
' O
Margaret B-PER
went O
up O
into O
the O
old O
nursery O
at O
the O
very O
top O
of O
the O
house O
, O
where O
Newton B-PER
was O
busy O
getting O
up O
some O
laces O
which O
were O
required O
for O
the O
wedding O
. O
While O
Newton B-PER
went O
( O
not O
without O
a O
muttered O
grumbling O
) O
to O
undo O
the O
shawls O
, O
which O
had O
already O
been O
exhibited O
four O
or O
five O
times O
that O
day O
, O
Margaret B-PER
looked O
round O
upon O
the B-FAC
nursery I-FAC
; O
the O
first O
room O
in O
that B-FAC
house I-FAC
with O
which O
she O
had O
become O
familiar O
nine O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
she O
was O
brought O
, O
all O
untamed O
from O
the B-LOC
forest I-LOC
, O
to O
share O
the B-FAC
home I-FAC
, O
the O
play O
, O
and O
the O
lessons O
of O
her B-PER
cousin I-PER
Edith B-PER
. O
She O
remembered O
the O
dark O
, O
dim O
look O
of O
the O
London B-GPE
nursery O
, O
presided O
over O
by O
an B-PER
austere I-PER
and I-PER
ceremonious I-PER
nurse I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
terribly I-PER
particular I-PER
about I-PER
clean I-PER
hands I-PER
and I-PER
torn I-PER
frocks I-PER
. O
She O
recollected O
the O
first O
tea O
up O
there B-FAC
-- O
separate O
from O
her B-PER
father I-PER
and O
aunt B-PER
, O
who O
were O
dining O
somewhere O
down O
below O
an O
infinite O
depth O
of O
stairs B-FAC
; O
for O
unless O
she O
were O
up O
in O
the O
sky O
( O
the O
child B-PER
thought O
) O
, O
they O
must O
be O
deep O
down O
in O
the O
bowels O
of O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
. O
At O
home B-FAC
-- O
before O
she O
came O
to O
live O
in O
Harley B-FAC
Street I-FAC
-- O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
dressing-room O
had O
been O
her B-FAC
nursery I-FAC
; O
and O
, O
as O
they O
kept O
early O
hours O
in O
the B-FAC
country I-FAC
parsonage I-FAC
, O
Margaret B-PER
had O
always O
had O
her O
meals O
with O
her B-PER
father I-PER
and O
mother B-PER
. O
Oh O
! O
well O
did O
the B-PER
tall I-PER
stately I-PER
girl I-PER
of I-PER
eighteen I-PER
remember O
the O
tears O
shed O
with O
such O
wild O
passion O
of O
grief O
by O
the B-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
of I-PER
nine I-PER
, O
as O
she O
hid O
her O
face O
under O
the O
bed-clothes O
, O
in O
that O
first O
night O
; O
and O
how O
she O
was O
bidden O
not O
to O
cry O
by O
the B-PER
nurse I-PER
, O
because O
it O
would O
disturb O
Miss B-PER
Edith O
; O
and O
how O
she O
had O
cried O
as O
bitterly O
, O
but O
more O
quietly O
, O
till O
her O
newly-seen B-PER
, I-PER
grand I-PER
, I-PER
pretty I-PER
aunt I-PER
had O
come O
softly O
upstairs B-FAC
with O
Mr. B-PER
Hale O
to O
show O
him O
his B-PER
little I-PER
sleeping I-PER
daughter I-PER
. O
Then O
the B-PER
little I-PER
Margaret I-PER
had O
hushed O
her O
sobs O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
lie O
quiet O
as O
if O
asleep O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
making O
her B-PER
father I-PER
unhappy O
by O
her O
grief O
, O
which O
she O
dared O
not O
express O
before O
her B-PER
aunt I-PER
, O
and O
which O
she O
rather O
thought O
it O
was O
wrong O
to O
feel O
at O
all O
after O
the O
long O
hoping O
, O
and O
planning O
, O
and O
contriving O
they O
had O
gone O
through O
at O
home B-FAC
, O
before O
her O
wardrobe O
could O
be O
arranged O
so O
as O
to O
suit O
her O
grander O
circumstances O
, O
and O
before O
papa B-PER
could O
leave O
his B-FAC
parish I-FAC
to O
come O
up O
to O
London B-GPE
, O
even O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O
Now O
she O
had O
got O
to O
love O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
nursery I-FAC
, O
though O
it O
was O
but O
a B-FAC
dismantled I-FAC
place I-FAC
; O
and O
she O
looked O
all O
round O
, O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
cat-like O
regret O
, O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
leaving O
it O
for O
ever O
in O
three O
days O
. O
' O
Ah O
Newton B-PER
! O
' O
said O
she O
, O
' O
I O
think O
we O
shall O
all O
be O
sorry O
to O
leave O
this B-FAC
dear I-FAC
old I-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
' O
PART O
I O
I O
THIS O
is O
the O
saddest O
story O
I O
have O
ever O
heard O
. O
We O
had O
known O
the B-PER
Ashburnhams I-PER
for O
nine O
seasons O
of O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
of I-GPE
Nauheim I-GPE
with O
an O
extreme O
intimacy O
-- O
or O
, O
rather O
with O
an O
acquaintanceship O
as O
loose O
and O
easy O
and O
yet O
as O
close O
as O
a O
good O
glove O
's O
with O
your O
hand O
. O
My B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
I O
knew O
Captain B-PER
and O
Mrs B-PER
Ashburnham O
as O
well O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
know O
anybody B-PER
, O
and O
yet O
, O
in O
another O
sense O
, O
we O
knew O
nothing O
at O
all O
about O
them O
. O
This O
is O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
a O
state O
of O
things O
only O
possible O
with O
English B-PER
people I-PER
of O
whom O
, O
till O
today O
, O
when O
I O
sit O
down O
to O
puzzle O
out O
what O
I O
know O
of O
this O
sad O
affair O
, O
I O
knew O
nothing O
whatever O
. O
Six O
months O
ago O
I O
had O
never O
been O
to O
England B-GPE
, O
and O
, O
certainly O
, O
I O
had O
never O
sounded O
the O
depths O
of O
an O
English O
heart O
. O
I O
had O
known O
the O
shallows O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
we O
were O
not O
acquainted O
with O
many O
English B-PER
people I-PER
. O
Living O
, O
as O
we O
perforce O
lived O
, O
in O
Europe B-GPE
, O
and O
being O
, O
as O
we O
perforce O
were O
, O
leisured O
Americans B-PER
, O
which O
is O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
that O
we O
were O
un-American O
, O
we O
were O
thrown O
very O
much O
into O
the O
society O
of O
the B-PER
nicer I-PER
English I-PER
. O
Paris B-GPE
, O
you O
see O
, O
was O
our O
home B-GPE
. O
Somewhere O
between O
Nice B-GPE
and O
Bordighera B-GPE
provided O
yearly B-LOC
winter I-LOC
quarters I-LOC
for O
us O
, O
and O
Nauheim B-GPE
always O
received O
us O
from O
July O
to O
September O
. O
You O
will O
gather O
from O
this O
statement O
that O
one O
of O
us O
had O
, O
as O
the O
saying O
is O
, O
a O
" O
heart O
" O
, O
and O
, O
from O
the O
statement O
that O
my B-PER
wife I-PER
is O
dead O
, O
that O
she O
was O
the B-PER
sufferer I-PER
. O
Captain B-PER
Ashburnham O
also O
had O
a O
heart O
. O
But O
, O
whereas O
a O
yearly O
month O
or O
so O
at O
Nauheim B-GPE
tuned O
him O
up O
to O
exactly O
the O
right O
pitch O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
twelvemonth O
, O
the O
two O
months O
or O
so O
were O
only O
just O
enough O
to O
keep O
poor O
Florence B-PER
alive O
from O
year O
to O
year O
. O
The O
reason O
for O
his O
heart O
was O
, O
approximately O
, O
polo O
, O
or O
too O
much O
hard O
sportsmanship O
in O
his O
youth O
. O
The O
reason O
for O
poor O
Florence B-PER
's O
broken O
years O
was O
a O
storm O
at O
sea B-LOC
upon O
our O
first O
crossing O
to O
Europe B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
immediate O
reasons O
for O
our O
imprisonment O
in O
that B-GPE
continent I-GPE
were O
doctor B-PER
's O
orders O
. O
They O
said O
that O
even O
the O
short O
Channel B-LOC
crossing O
might O
well O
kill O
the B-PER
poor I-PER
thing I-PER
. O
When O
we O
all O
first O
met O
, O
Captain B-PER
Ashburnham O
, O
home O
on O
sick O
leave O
from O
an B-GPE
India I-GPE
to I-GPE
which I-GPE
he I-GPE
was I-GPE
never I-GPE
to I-GPE
return I-GPE
, O
was O
thirty-three O
; O
Mrs B-PER
Ashburnham O
Leonora O
-- O
was O
thirty-one O
. O
I O
was O
thirty-six O
and O
poor O
Florence B-PER
thirty O
. O
Thus O
today O
Florence B-PER
would O
have O
been O
thirty-nine O
and O
Captain B-PER
Ashburnham O
forty-two O
; O
whereas O
I O
am O
forty-five O
and O
Leonora B-PER
forty O
. O
You O
will O
perceive O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
our O
friendship O
has O
been O
a O
young-middle-aged O
affair O
, O
since O
we O
were O
all O
of O
us O
of O
quite O
quiet O
dispositions O
, O
the B-PER
Ashburnhams I-PER
being O
more O
particularly O
what O
in O
England B-GPE
it O
is O
the O
custom O
to O
call O
" O
quite B-PER
good I-PER
people I-PER
" O
. O
They O
were O
descended O
, O
as O
you O
will O
probably O
expect O
, O
from O
the B-PER
Ashburnham I-PER
who O
accompanied O
Charles B-PER
I I-PER
to O
the O
scaffold O
, O
and O
, O
as O
you O
must O
also O
expect O
with O
this B-PER
class I-PER
of I-PER
English I-PER
people I-PER
, O
you O
would O
never O
have O
noticed O
it O
. O
Mrs B-PER
Ashburnham O
was O
a B-PER
Powys I-PER
; O
Florence B-PER
was O
a B-PER
Hurlbird I-PER
of O
Stamford B-GPE
, O
Connecticut B-GPE
, O
where O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
they O
are O
more O
old-fashioned O
than O
even O
the B-PER
inhabitants I-PER
of O
Cranford B-GPE
, O
England B-GPE
, O
could O
have O
been O
. O
I O
myself O
am O
a B-PER
Dowell I-PER
of O
Philadelphia B-GPE
, O
Pa. B-GPE
, O
where O
, O
it O
is O
historically O
true O
, O
there O
are O
more O
old B-PER
English I-PER
families I-PER
than O
you O
would O
find O
in O
any O
six O
English B-LOC
counties I-LOC
taken O
together O
. O
I O
carry O
about O
with O
me O
, O
indeed O
-- O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
invisibly O
anchored O
me O
to O
any O
spot O
upon O
the O
globe O
-- O
the O
title O
deeds O
of O
my O
farm O
, O
which O
once O
covered O
several O
blocks O
between O
Chestnut B-FAC
and O
Walnut B-FAC
Streets I-FAC
. O
These O
title O
deeds O
are O
of O
wampum O
, O
the O
grant O
of O
an B-PER
Indian I-PER
chief I-PER
to O
the B-PER
first I-PER
Dowell I-PER
, O
who O
left O
Farnham B-GPE
in O
Surrey B-GPE
in O
company O
with O
William B-PER
Penn I-PER
. O
Florence B-PER
's O
people O
, O
as O
is O
so O
often O
the O
case O
with O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Connecticut B-GPE
, O
came O
from O
the B-FAC
neighbourhood I-FAC
of I-FAC
Fordingbridge I-FAC
, O
where O
the B-PER
Ashburnhams I-PER
' O
place O
is O
. O
From O
there B-FAC
, O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
I O
am O
actually O
writing O
. O
You O
may O
well O
ask O
why O
I O
write O
. O
And O
yet O
my O
reasons O
are O
quite O
many O
. O
For O
it O
is O
not O
unusual O
in O
human B-PER
beings I-PER
who O
have O
witnessed O
the O
sack O
of O
a B-GPE
city I-GPE
or O
the O
falling O
to O
pieces O
of O
a B-PER
people I-PER
to O
desire O
to O
set O
down O
what O
they O
have O
witnessed O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
unknown B-PER
heirs I-PER
or O
of O
generations B-PER
infinitely O
remote O
; O
or O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
just O
to O
get O
the O
sight O
out O
of O
their O
heads O
. O
Some O
one O
has O
said O
that O
the O
death O
of O
a O
mouse O
from O
cancer O
is O
the O
whole O
sack O
of O
Rome B-GPE
by O
the B-PER
Goths I-PER
, O
and O
I O
swear O
to O
you O
that O
the O
breaking O
up O
of O
our B-PER
little I-PER
four-square I-PER
coterie I-PER
was O
such O
another O
unthinkable O
event O
. O
Supposing O
that O
you O
should O
come O
upon O
us O
sitting O
together O
at O
one O
of O
the O
little O
tables O
in O
front O
of O
the B-FAC
club I-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
let O
us O
say O
, O
at O
Homburg B-GPE
, O
taking O
tea O
of O
an O
afternoon O
and O
watching O
the O
miniature O
golf O
, O
you O
would O
have O
said O
that O
, O
as O
human O
affairs O
go O
, O
we O
were O
an O
extraordinarily O
safe O
castle O
. O
We O
were O
, O
if O
you O
will O
, O
one O
of O
those O
tall O
ships O
with O
the O
white O
sails O
upon O
a B-LOC
blue I-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
one O
of O
those O
things O
that O
seem O
the O
proudest O
and O
the O
safest O
of O
all O
the O
beautiful O
and O
safe O
things O
that O
God B-PER
has O
permitted O
the O
mind O
of O
men B-PER
to O
frame O
. O
Where O
better O
could O
one O
take O
refuge O
? O
Where O
better O
? O
Permanence O
? O
Stability O
? O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
it O

gone O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
that O
long O
, O
tranquil O
life O
, O
which O
was O
just O
stepping O
a O
minuet O

vanished O
in O
four O
crashing O
days O
at O
the O
end O
of O
nine O
years O
and O
six O
weeks O
. O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
yes O
, O
our O
intimacy O
was O
like O
a O
minuet O
, O
simply O
because O
on O
every O
possible O
occasion O
and O
in O
every O
possible O
circumstance O
we O
knew O
where O
to O
go O
, O
where O
to O
sit O
, O
which O
table O
we O
unanimously O
should O
choose O
; O
and O
we O
could O
rise O
and O
go O
, O
all O
four O
together O
, O
without O
a O
signal O
from O
any B-PER
one I-PER
of I-PER
us I-PER
, O
always O
to O
the O

of O
the O

in O

, O
if O

in O
discreet B-FAC

No O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
gone O

You O
ca O
n't O
kill O
a O

You O
may O
shut O
up O
the O

close O
the O

in O
the O

the O

the O

The B-PER
mob I-PER
may O
sack O
Versailles B-GPE

the B-FAC
Trianon I-FAC
may O
fall O
, O
but O
surely O
the O
minuet O
-- O
the O
minuet O
itself O
is O
dancing O
itself O
away O
into O
the O
furthest O
stars O
, O
even O
as O
our O
minuet O
of O
the B-FAC
Hessian I-FAC
bathing I-FAC
places I-FAC
must O
be O
stepping O
itself O
still O

Is O

there O
any O
heaven B-LOC

old O
beautiful O

old O
beautiful O

prolong O
themselves O

Is O

there O
any O
Nirvana B-LOC
pervaded O
by O
the O
faint O

that O

that O
yet O
had O
frail B-PER

tremulous I-PER

and I-PER
everlasting I-PER
souls I-PER
? O
No O
, O
by O
God B-PER
, O
it O
is O
false O
! O
It O
was O
n't O
a O
minuet O
that O
we O
stepped O
; O
it O
was O
a B-FAC
prison I-FAC

a O

full O
of O

tied O
down O

that O

the O

we O
went O
along O
the O
shaded O

of O
the O
Taunus B-FAC

And O
yet O
I O
swear O
by O
the O
sacred O
name O
of O
my B-PER
creator I-PER
that O
it O
was O
true O

It O
was O
true O

the O
true O
splash O
of O

from O
the O

For O
, O
if O
for O

we O
were O
four B-PER

with I-PER

is O

If O

days O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
true O
to O
say O
that O
for O
nine O
years O
I O
possessed O
a O
goodly O
apple O
? O
So O
it O
may O
well O
be O
with O
Edward B-PER
Ashburnham I-PER
, O
with O
Leonora B-PER
his B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
with O
poor O
dear O
Florence B-PER
. O
And O
, O
if O
you O
come O
to O
think O
of O
it O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
a O
little O
odd O
that O
the O
physical O
rottenness O
of O
at O
least O
two O
pillars O
of O
our B-FAC
four-square I-FAC
house I-FAC
never O
presented O
itself O
to O
my O
mind O
as O
a O
menace O
to O
its O
security O
? O
It O
does O
n't O
so O
present O
itself O
now O
though O
the B-PER
two I-PER
of I-PER
them I-PER
are O
actually O
dead O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
... O
. O
I O
know O
nothing O
-- O
nothing O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
-- O
of O
the O
hearts O
of O
men B-PER
. O
I O
only O
know O
that O
I O
am O
alone O
-- O
horribly O
alone O
. O
No O
hearthstone O
will O
ever O
again O
witness O
, O
for O
me O
, O
friendly O
intercourse O
. O
No O
smoking-room B-FAC
will O
ever O
be O
other O
than O
peopled O
with O
incalculable O
simulacra O
amidst O
smoke O
wreaths O
. O
Yet O
, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
God B-PER
, O
what O
should O
I O
know O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
life O
of O
the O
hearth O
and O
of O
the B-FAC
smoking-room I-FAC
, O
since O
my O
whole O
life O
has O
been O
passed O
in O
those O
places B-FAC
? O
The O
warm O
hearthside O
! O
-- O
Well O
, O
there O
was O
Florence B-PER
: O
I O
believe O
that O
for O
the O
twelve O
years O
her O
life O
lasted O
, O
after O
the O
storm O
that O
seemed O
irretrievably O
to O
have O
weakened O
her O
heart O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
for O
one O
minute O
she O
was O
out O
of O
my O
sight O
, O
except O
when O
she O
was O
safely O
tucked O
up O
in O
bed O
and O
I O
should O
be O
downstairs B-FAC
, O
talking O
to O
some B-PER
good I-PER
fellow I-PER
or O
other O
in O
some B-FAC
lounge I-FAC
or O
smoking-room B-FAC
or O
taking O
my O
final O
turn O
with O
a O
cigar O
before O
going O
to O
bed O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
understand O
, O
blame O
Florence B-PER
. O
But O
how O
can O
she O
have O
known O
what O
she O
knew O
? O
How O
could O
she O
have O
got O
to O
know O
it O
? O
To O
know O
it O
so O
fully O
. O
Heavens O
! O
There O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
the O
actual O
time O
. O
It O
must O
have O
been O
when O
I O
was O
taking O
my O
baths O
, O
and O
my O
Swedish O
exercises O
, O
being O
manicured O
. O
Leading O
the O
life O
I O
did O
, O
of O
the B-PER
sedulous I-PER
, I-PER
strained I-PER
nurse I-PER
, O
I O
had O
to O
do O
something O
to O
keep O
myself O
fit O
. O
It O
must O
have O
been O
then O
! O
Yet O
even O
that O
ca O
n't O
have O
been O
enough O
time O
to O
get O
the O
tremendously O
long O
conversations O
full O
of O
worldly O
wisdom O
that O
Leonora B-PER
has O
reported O
to O
me O
since O
their O
deaths O
. O
And O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
imagine O
that O
during O
our O
prescribed O
walks O
in O
Nauheim B-GPE
and O
the O
neighbourhood B-FAC
she O
found O
time O
to O
carry O
on O
the O
protracted O
negotiations O
which O
she O
did O
carry O
on O
between O
Edward B-PER
Ashburnham I-PER
and O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
? O
And O
is O
n't O
it O
incredible O
that O
during O
all O
that O
time O
Edward B-PER
and O
Leonora B-PER
never O
spoke O
a O
word O
to O
each O
other O
in O
private O
? O
What O
is O
one O
to O
think O
of O
humanity O
? O
For O
I O
swear O
to O
you O
that O
they O
were O
the B-PER
model I-PER
couple I-PER
. O
He O
was O
as O
devoted O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
be O
without O
appearing O
fatuous O
. O
So O
well O
set O
up O
, O
with O
such O
honest O
blue O
eyes O
, O
such O
a O
touch O
of O
stupidity O
, O
such O
a O
warm O
goodheartedness O
! O
And O
she O
-- O
so O
tall O
, O
so O
splendid O
in O
the O
saddle O
, O
so O
fair O
! O
Yes O
, O
Leonora B-PER
was O
extraordinarily O
fair O
and O
so O
extraordinarily O
the O
real O
thing O
that O
she O
seemed O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
. O
You O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
get O
it O
all O
so O
superlatively O
together O
. O
To O
be O
the B-PER
county I-PER
family I-PER
, O
to O
look O
the B-PER
county I-PER
family I-PER
, O
to O
be O
so O
appropriately O
and O
perfectly O
wealthy O
; O
to O
be O
so O
perfect O
in O
manner O
-- O
even O
just O
to O
the O
saving O
touch O
of O
insolence O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
necessary O
. O
To O
have O
all O
that O
and O
to O
be O
all O
that O
! O
No O
, O
it O
was O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
only O
this O
afternoon O
, O
talking O
over O
the O
whole O
matter O
she O
said O
to O
me O
: O
" O
Once O
I O
tried O
to O
have O
a B-PER
lover I-PER
but O
I O
was O
so O
sick O
at O
the O
heart O
, O
so O
utterly O
worn O
out O
that O
I O
had O
to O
send O
him O
away O
. O
" O
That O
struck O
me O
as O
the O
most O
amazing O
thing O
I O
had O
ever O
heard O
. O
She O
said O
" O
I O
was O
actually O
in O
a B-PER
man I-PER
's O
arms O
. O
Such O
a B-PER
nice I-PER
chap I-PER
! O
Such O
a B-PER
dear I-PER
fellow I-PER
! O
And O
I O
was O
saying O
to O
myself O
, O
fiercely O
, O
hissing O
it O
between O
my O
teeth O
, O
as O
they O
say O
in O
novels O
-- O
and O
really O
clenching O
them O
together O
: O
I O
was O
saying O
to O
myself O
: O
' O
Now O
, O
I O
'm O
in O
for O
it O
and O
I O
'll O
really O
have O
a O
good O
time O
for O
once O
in O
my O
life O
-- O
for O
once O
in O
my O
life O
! O
' O
It O
was O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
in O
a B-VEH
carriage I-VEH
, O
coming O
back O
from O
a O
hunt O
ball O
. O
Eleven O
miles O
we O
had O
to O
drive O
! O
And O
then O
suddenly O
the O
bitterness O
of O
the O
endless O
poverty O
, O
of O
the O
endless O
acting O
-- O
it O
fell O
on O
me O
like O
a O
blight O
, O
it O
spoilt O
everything O
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
had O
to O
realize O
that O
I O
had O
been O
spoilt O
even O
for O
the O
good O
time O
when O
it O
came O
. O
And O
I O
burst O
out O
crying O
and O
I O
cried O
and O
I O
cried O
for O
the O
whole O
eleven O
miles O
. O
Just O
imagine O
me O
crying O
! O
And O
just O
imagine O
me O
making O
a B-PER
fool I-PER
of O
the B-PER
poor I-PER
dear I-PER
chap I-PER
like O
that O
. O
It O
certainly O
was O
n't O
playing O
the O
game O
, O
was O
it O
now O

go O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
my B-PER
father I-PER
kept O
the B-FAC
Admiral I-FAC
Benbow I-FAC
inn I-FAC
and O
the B-PER
brown I-PER
old I-PER
seaman I-PER
with O
the O
sabre O
cut O
first O
took O
up O
his O
lodging O
under O
our B-FAC
roof I-FAC
. O
I O
remember O
him O
as O
if O
it O
were O
yesterday O
, O
as O
he O
came O
plodding O
to O
the B-FAC
inn I-FAC
door O
, O
his O
sea-chest O
following O
behind O
him O
in O
a O
hand-barrow O
-- O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
strong I-PER
, I-PER
heavy I-PER
, I-PER
nut-brown I-PER
man I-PER
, O
his O
tarry O
pigtail O
falling O
over O
the O
shoulder O
of O
his O
soiled O
blue O
coat O
, O
his O
hands O
ragged O
and O
scarred O
, O
with O
black O
, O
broken O
nails O
, O
and O
the O
sabre O
cut O
across O
one O
cheek O
, O
a O
dirty O
, O
livid O
white O
. O
I O
remember O
him O
looking O
round O
the B-FAC
cover I-FAC
and O
whistling O
to O
himself O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O
and O
then O
breaking O
out O
in O
that O
old O
sea-song O
that O
he O
sang O
so O
often O
afterwards O
: O
" O
Fifteen O
men B-PER
on O
the B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
's O
chest O
-- O
Yo-ho-ho O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
rum O
! O
" O
in O
the O
high O
, O
old O
tottering O
voice O
that O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
tuned O
and O
broken O
at O
the B-FAC
capstan I-FAC
bars I-FAC
. O
Then O
he O
rapped O
on O
the O
door O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
stick O
like O
a O
handspike O
that O
he O
carried O
, O
and O
when O
my B-PER
father I-PER
appeared O
, O
called O
roughly O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
rum O
. O
This O
, O
when O
it O
was O
brought O
to O
him O
, O
he O
drank O
slowly O
, O
like O
a O
connoisseur O
, O
lingering O
on O
the O
taste O
and O
still O
looking O
about O
him O
at O
the B-LOC
cliffs I-LOC
and O
up O
at O
our O
signboard O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a B-LOC
handy I-LOC
cove I-LOC
, O
" O
says O
he O
at O
length O
; O
" O
and O
a B-FAC
pleasant I-FAC
sittyated I-FAC
grog-shop I-FAC
. O
Much O
company B-PER
, O
mate B-PER
? O
" O
My B-PER
father I-PER
told O
him O
no O
, O
very O
little O
company B-PER
, O
the O
more O
was O
the O
pity O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
this O
is O
the B-FAC
berth I-FAC
for O
me O
. O
Here O
you O
, O
matey B-PER
, O
" O
he O
cried O
to O
the B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
trundled I-PER
the I-PER
barrow I-PER
; O
" O
bring O
up O
alongside O
and O
help O
up O
my O
chest O
. O
I O
'll O
stay O
here B-FAC
a O
bit O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
. O
" O
I O
'm O
a B-PER
plain I-PER
man I-PER
; O
rum O
and O
bacon O
and O
eggs O
is O
what O
I O
want O

head O
up O

What O
you O
mought O
call O

You O
mought O
call O
me O
captain B-PER
. O
Oh O
, O
I O
see O
what O
you O
're O
at O
-- O
there O
" O
; O
and O
he O
threw O
down O
three O
or O
four O
gold O
pieces O
on O
the O
threshold O
. O
" O
You O
can O
tell O
me O
when O
I O
've O
worked O
through O
that O
, O
" O
says O
he O
, O
looking O
as O
fierce O
as O
a B-PER
commander I-PER
. O
And O
indeed O
bad O
as O
his O
clothes O
were O
and O
coarsely O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
had O
none O
of O
the O
appearance O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
sailed I-PER
before I-PER
the I-PER
mast I-PER
, O
but O
seemed O
like O
a B-PER
mate I-PER
or O
skipper B-PER
accustomed I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
obeyed I-PER
or I-PER
to I-PER
strike I-PER
. O
The B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
came I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER
barrow I-PER
told O
us O
the O
mail O
had O
set O
him O
down O
the O
morning O
before O
at O
the B-FAC
Royal I-FAC
George I-FAC
, O
that O
he O
had O
inquired O
what O
inns B-FAC
there O
were O
along O
the B-LOC
coast I-LOC
, O
and O
hearing O
ours O
well O
spoken O
of O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
and O
described O
as O
lonely O
, O
had O
chosen O
it O
from O
the O
others O
for O
his B-FAC
place I-FAC
of I-FAC
residence I-FAC
. O
And O
that O
was O
all O
we O
could O
learn O
of O
our B-PER
guest I-PER
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
very I-PER
silent I-PER
man I-PER
by O
custom O
. O
All O
day O
he O
hung O
round O
the B-LOC
cove I-LOC
or O
upon O
the B-LOC
cliffs I-LOC
with O
a O
brass O
telescope O
; O
all O
evening O
he O
sat O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
parlour O
next O
the B-FAC
fire I-FAC
and O
drank O
rum O
and O
water O
very O
strong O
. O
Mostly O
he O
would O
not O
speak O
when O
spoken O
to O
, O
only O
look O
up O
sudden O
and O
fierce O
and O
blow O
through O
his O
nose O
like O
a O
fog-horn O
; O
and O
we O
and O
the O
people O
who O
came O
about O
our B-FAC
house I-FAC
soon O
learned O
to O
let O
him O
be O
. O
Every O
day O
when O
he O
came O
back O
from O
his O
stroll O
he O
would O
ask O
if O
any O
seafaring B-PER
men I-PER
had O
gone O
by O
along O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
. O
At O
first O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
want O
of O
company O
of O
his O
own O
kind O
that O
made O
him O
ask O
this O
question O
, O
but O
at O
last O
we O
began O
to O
see O
he O
was O
desirous O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O
When O
a B-PER
seaman I-PER
did O
put O
up O
at O
the B-FAC
Admiral I-FAC
Benbow I-FAC
( O
as O
now O
and O
then O
some O
did O
, O
making O
by O
the B-FAC
coast I-FAC
road I-FAC
for O
Bristol B-GPE
) O
he O
would O
look O
in O
at O
him O
through O
the O
curtained O
door O
before O
he O
entered O
the B-FAC
parlour I-FAC
; O
and O
he O
was O
always O
sure O
to O
be O
as O
silent O
as O
a O
mouse O
when O
any O
such O
was O
present O
. O
For O
me O
, O
at O
least O
, O
there O
was O
no O
secret O
about O
the O
matter O
, O
for O
I O
was O
, O
in O
a O
way O
, O
a B-PER
sharer I-PER
in O
his O
alarms O
. O
He O
had O
taken O
me O
aside O
one O
day O
and O
promised O
me O
a O
silver O
fourpenny O
on O
the O
first O
of O
every O
month O
if O
I O
would O
only O
keep O
my O
" O
weather-eye O
open O
for O
a B-PER
seafaring I-PER
man I-PER
with O
one O
leg O
" O
and O
let O
him O
know O
the O
moment O
he O
appeared O
. O
Often O
enough O
when O
the O
first O
of O
the O
month O
came O
round O
and O
I O
applied O
to O
him O
for O
my O
wage O
, O
he O
would O
only O
blow O
through O
his O
nose O
at O
me O
and O
stare O
me O
down O
, O
but O
before O
the O
week O
was O
out O
he O
was O
sure O
to O
think O
better O
of O
it O
, O
bring O
me O
my O
four-penny O
piece O
, O
and O
repeat O
his O
orders O
to O
look O
out O
for O
" O
the B-PER
seafaring I-PER
man I-PER
with O
one O
leg O
. O
" O
How O
that B-PER
personage I-PER
haunted O
my O
dreams O
, O
I O
need O
scarcely O
tell O
you O
. O
On O
stormy O
nights O
, O
when O
the O
wind O
shook O
the O
four O
corners O
of O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
and O
the O
surf O
roared O
along O
the B-LOC
cove I-LOC
and O
up O
the B-LOC
cliffs I-LOC
, O
I O
would O
see O
him O
in O
a O
thousand O
forms O
, O
and O
with O
a O
thousand O
diabolical O
expressions O
. O
Now O
the O
leg O
would O
be O
cut O
off O
at O
the O
knee O
, O
now O
at O
the O
hip O
; O
now O
he O
was O
a B-PER
monstrous I-PER
kind I-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
creature I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
never I-PER
had I-PER
but I-PER
the I-PER
one I-PER
leg I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
that I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
middle I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
body I-PER
. O
To O
see O
him O
leap O
and O
run O
and O
pursue O
me O
over O
hedge O
and O
ditch O
was O
the O
worst O
of O
nightmares O
. O
And O
altogether O
I O
paid O
pretty O
dear O
for O
my O
monthly O
fourpenny O
piece O
, O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
these O
abominable O
fancies O
. O
But O
though O
I O
was O
so O
terrified O
by O
the O
idea O
of O
the B-PER
seafaring I-PER
man I-PER
with O
one O
leg O
, O
I O
was O
far O
less O
afraid O
of O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
himself I-PER
than O
anybody B-PER
else I-PER
who I-PER
knew I-PER
him I-PER
. O
There O
were O
nights O
when O
he O
took O
a O
deal O
more O
rum O
and O
water O
than O
his O
head O
would O
carry O
; O
and O
then O
he O
would O
sometimes O
sit O
and O
sing O
his O
wicked O
, O
old O
, O
wild O
sea-songs O
, O
minding O
nobody B-PER
; O
but O
sometimes O
he O
would O
call O
for O
glasses O
round O
and O
force O
all O
the B-PER
trembling I-PER
company I-PER
to O
listen O
to O
his O
stories O
or O
bear O
a O
chorus O
to O
his O
singing O
. O
Often O
I O
have O
heard O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
shaking O
with O
" O
Yo-ho-ho O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
rum O
, O
" O
all O
the B-PER
neighbours I-PER
joining O
in O
for O
dear O
life O
, O
with O
the O
fear O
of O
death O
upon O
them O
, O
and O
each O
singing O
louder O
than O
the O
other O
to O
avoid O
remark O
. O
For O
in O
these O
fits O
he O
was O
the B-PER
most I-PER
overriding I-PER
companion I-PER
ever O
known O
; O
he O
would O
slap O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
table O
for O
silence O
all O
round O
; O
he O
would O
fly O
up O
in O
a O
passion O
of O
anger O
at O
a O
question O
, O
or O
sometimes O
because O
none O
was O
put O
, O
and O
so O
he O
judged O
the B-PER
company I-PER
was O
not O
following O
his O
story O
. O
Nor O
would O
he O
allow O
anyone B-PER
to O
leave O
the B-FAC
inn I-FAC
till O
he O
had O
drunk O
himself O
sleepy O
and O
reeled O
off O
to O
bed O
. O
His O
stories O
were O
what O
frightened O
people B-PER
worst O
of O
all O
. O
Dreadful O
stories O
they O
were O
-- O
about O
hanging O
, O
and O
walking O
the O
plank O
, O
and O
storms O
at B-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
and O
the B-LOC
Dry I-LOC
Tortugas I-LOC
, O
and O
wild O
deeds O
and O
places B-LOC
on O
the B-LOC
Spanish I-LOC
Main I-LOC
. O
By O
his O
own O
account O
he O
must O
have O
lived O
his O
life O
among O
some B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
wickedest I-PER
men I-PER
that O
God B-PER
ever O
allowed O
upon O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
language O
in O
which O
he O
told O
these O
stories O
shocked O
our B-PER
plain I-PER
country I-PER
people I-PER
almost O
as O
much O
as O
the O
crimes O
that O
he O
described O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
was O
always O
saying O
the B-FAC
inn I-FAC
would O
be O
ruined O
, O
for O
people B-PER
would O
soon O
cease O
coming O
there B-FAC
to O
be O
tyrannized O
over O
and O
put O
down O
, O
and O
sent O
shivering O
to O
their O
beds O
; O
but O
I O
really O
believe O
his O
presence O
did O
us O
good O
. O
People B-PER
were O
frightened O
at O
the O
time O
, O
but O
on O
looking O
back O
they O
rather O
liked O
it O
; O
it O
was O
a O
fine O
excitement O
in O
a O
quiet O
country O
life O
, O
and O
there O
was O
even O
a B-PER
party I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
younger I-PER
men I-PER
who O
pretended O
to O
admire O
him O
, O
calling O
him O
a B-PER
" I-PER
true I-PER
sea-dog I-PER
" I-PER
and O
a B-PER
" I-PER
real I-PER
old I-PER
salt I-PER
" I-PER
and O
such O
like O
names O
, O
and O
saying O
there O
was O
the O
sort O
of O
man O
that O
made O
England B-GPE
terrible O
at O
sea B-LOC
. O
In O
one O
way O
, O
indeed O
, O
he O
bade O
fair O
to O
ruin O
us O
, O
for O
he O
kept O
on O
staying O
week O
after O
week O
, O
and O
at O
last O
month O
after O
month O
, O
so O
that O
all O
the O
money O
had O
been O
long O
exhausted O
, O
and O
still O
my B-PER
father I-PER
never O
plucked O
up O
the O
heart O
to O
insist O
on O
having O
more O
. O
If O
ever O
he O
mentioned O
it O
, O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
blew O
through O
his O
nose O
so O
loudly O
that O
you O
might O
say O
he O
roared O
, O
and O
stared O
my B-PER
poor I-PER
father I-PER
out O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
wringing O
his O
hands O
after O
such O
a O
rebuff O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
the O
annoyance O
and O
the O
terror O
he O
lived O
in O
must O
have O
greatly O
hastened O
his O
early O
and O
unhappy O
death O
. O
All O
the O
time O
he O
lived O
with O
us O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
made O
no O
change O
whatever O
in O
his O
dress O
but O
to O
buy O
some O
stockings O
from O
a B-PER
hawker I-PER
. O
One O
of O
the O
cocks O
of O
his O
hat O
having O
fallen O
down O
, O
he O
let O
it O
hang O
from O
that O
day O
forth O
, O
though O
it O
was O
a O
great O
annoyance O
when O
it O
blew O
. O
I O
remember O
the O
appearance O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
which O
he O
patched O
himself O
upstairs B-FAC
in O
his B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
and O
which O
, O
before O
the O
end O
, O
was O
nothing O
but O
patches O
. O
He O
never O
wrote O
or O
received O
a O
letter O
, O
and O
he O
never O
spoke O
with O
any O
but O
the B-PER
neighbours I-PER
, O
and O
with O
these O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
only O
when O
drunk O
on O
rum O
. O
The O
great O
sea-chest O
none O
of O
us O
had O
ever O
seen O
open O
. O
He O
was O
only O
once O
crossed O
, O
and O
that O
was O
towards O
the O
end O
, O
when O
my B-PER
poor I-PER
father I-PER
was O
far O
gone O
in O
a O
decline O
that O
took O
him O
off O
. O
Dr. B-PER
Livesey O
came O
late O
one O
afternoon O
to O
see O
the B-PER
patient I-PER
, O
took O
a O
bit O
of O
dinner O
from O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
and O
went O
into O
the B-FAC
parlour I-FAC
to O
smoke O
a O
pipe O
until O
his O
horse O
should O
come O
down O
from O
the B-GPE
hamlet I-GPE
, O
for O
we O
had O
no O
stabling O
at O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
Benbow I-FAC
. O
I O
followed O
him O
in O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
observing O
the O
contrast O
the B-PER
neat I-PER
, I-PER
bright I-PER
doctor I-PER
, O
with O
his O
powder O
as O
white O
as O
snow O
and O
his O
bright O
, O
black O
eyes O
and O
pleasant O
manners O
, O
made O
with O
the B-PER
coltish I-PER
country I-PER
folk I-PER
, O
and O
above O
all O
, O
with O
that B-PER
filthy I-PER
, I-PER
heavy I-PER
, I-PER
bleared I-PER
scarecrow I-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
pirate I-PER
of O
ours O
, O
sitting O
, O
far O
gone O
in O
rum O
, O
with O
his O
arms O
on O
the O
table O
. O
Suddenly O
he O
-- O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
, O
that O
is O
-- O
began O
to O
pipe O
up O
his O
eternal O
song O
: O
" O
Fifteen O
men B-PER
on O
the B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
's O
chest O
-- O
Yo-ho-ho O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
rum O
! O
Drink O
and O
the B-PER
devil I-PER
had O
done O
for O
the O
rest O
-- O
Yo-ho-ho O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
rum O
! O
" O
At O
first O
I O
had O
supposed O
" O
the B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
's O
chest O
" O
to O
be O
that O
identical O
big O
box O
of O
his O
upstairs B-FAC
in O
the B-FAC
front I-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
and O
the O
thought O
had O
been O
mingled O
in O
my O
nightmares O
with O
that O
of O
the B-PER
one-legged I-PER
seafaring I-PER
man I-PER
. O
But O
by O
this O
time O
we O
had O
all O
long O
ceased O
to O
pay O
any O
particular O
notice O
to O
the O
song O
; O
it O
was O
new O
, O
that O
night O
, O
to O
nobody O
but O
Dr. B-PER
Livesey O
, O
and O
on O
him O
I O
observed O
it O
did O
not O
produce O
an O
agreeable O
effect O
, O
for O
he O
looked O
up O
for O
a O
moment O
quite O
angrily O
before O
he O
went O
on O
with O
his O
talk O
to O
old O
Taylor B-PER
, O
the B-PER
gardener I-PER
, O
on O
a O
new O
cure O
for O
the O
rheumatics O
. O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the B-PER
captain I-PER
gradually O
brightened O
up O
at O
his O
own O
music O
, O
and O
at O
last O
flapped O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
table O
before O
him O
in O
a O
way O
we O
all O
knew O
to O
mean O
silence O
. O
The O
voices O
stopped O
at O
once O
, O
all O
but O
Dr. B-PER
Livesey O
's O
; O
he O
went O
on O
as O
before O
speaking O
clear O
and O
kind O
and O
drawing O
briskly O
at O
his O
pipe O
between O
every O
word O
or O
two O
. O
The B-PER
captain I-PER
glared O
at O
him O
for O
a O
while O
, O
flapped O
his O
hand O
again O
, O
glared O
still O
harder O
, O
and O
at O
last O
broke O
out O
with O
a O
villainous O
, O
low O
oath O
, O
" O
Silence O

there O

between O

The O
cold O
passed O
reluctantly O
from O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
retiring O
fogs O
revealed O
an O
army O
stretched O
out O
on O
the B-LOC
hills I-LOC
, O
resting O
. O
As O
the B-LOC
landscape I-LOC
changed O
from O
brown O
to O
green O
, O
the B-ORG
army I-ORG
awakened O
, O
and O
began O
to O
tremble O
with O
eagerness O
at O
the O
noise O
of O
rumors O
. O
It O
cast O
its O
eyes O
upon O
the B-FAC
roads I-FAC
, O
which O
were O
growing O
from O
long B-FAC
troughs I-FAC
of I-FAC
liquid I-FAC
mud I-FAC
to O
proper B-FAC
thoroughfares I-FAC
. O
A B-LOC
river I-LOC
, I-LOC
amber-tinted I-LOC
in I-LOC
the I-LOC
shadow I-LOC
of I-LOC
its I-LOC
banks I-LOC
, O
purled O
at O
the B-PER
army I-PER
's O
feet O
; O
and O
at O
night O
, O
when O
the B-LOC
stream I-LOC
had O
become O
of O
a B-LOC
sorrowful I-LOC
blackness I-LOC
, O
one O
could O
see O
across O
it O
the O
red O
, O
eyelike O
gleam O
of O
hostile O
camp-fires O
set O
in O
the O
low O
brows O
of O
distant B-LOC
hills I-LOC

Once O
a B-PER
certain I-PER
tall I-PER
soldier I-PER
developed O
virtues O
and O
went O
resolutely O
to O
wash O
a O
shirt O
. O
He O
came O
flying O
back O
from O
a B-LOC
brook I-LOC
waving O
his O
garment O
bannerlike O
. O
He O
was O
swelled O
with O
a O
tale O
he O
had O
heard O
from O
a B-PER
reliable I-PER
friend I-PER
, O
who O
had O
heard O
it O
from O
a B-PER
truthful I-PER
cavalryman I-PER
, O
who O
had O
heard O
it O
from O
his O
trustworthy O
brother O
, O
one O
of O
the O
orderlies O
at O
division B-FAC
headquarters I-FAC
. O
He O
adopted O
the O
important O
air O
of O
a O
herald O
in O
red O
and O
gold O
. O
" O
We O
're O
goin O
' O
t O
' O

t O
' O
morrah O
-- O
sure O
, O
" O
he O
said O
pompously O
to O
a O
group O
in O
the B-FAC
company I-FAC
street I-FAC
. O
" O
We O
're O
goin O
' O

up O

behint O
'em O

" O
To O
his B-PER
attentive I-PER
audience I-PER
he O
drew O
a O
loud O
and O
elaborate O
plan O
of O
a O
very O
brilliant O
campaign O
. O
When O
he O
had O
finished O
, O
the B-PER
blue-clothed I-PER
men I-PER
scattered O
into O
small B-PER
arguing I-PER
groups I-PER
between O
the O
rows O
of O
squat O
brown O
huts O
. O
A O
negro O
teamster O
who O
had O
been O
dancing O
upon O
a O
cracker O
box O
with O
the O
hilarious O
encouragement O
of O
twoscore B-PER
soldiers I-PER
was O
deserted O
. O
He O
sat O
mournfully O
down O
. O
Smoke O
drifted O
lazily O
from O
a O
multitude O
of O
quaint O
chimneys O
. O
" O

that O

" O
said O
another B-PER
private I-PER
loudly O
. O
His O
smooth O
face O
was O
flushed O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
were O
thrust O
sulkily O
into O
his O
trouser O

pockets O
. O
He O
took O
the O
matter O
as O
an O
affront O
to O
him O
. O
" O

" O
The B-PER
tall I-PER
soldier I-PER
felt O
called O
upon O
to O
defend O
the O
truth O
of O
a O
rumor O
he O
himself O
had O
introduced O
. O
He O
and O
the O
loud O
one O
came O
near O
to O
fighting O
over O
it O
. O
A B-PER
corporal I-PER
began O
to O
swear O
before O
the B-PER
assemblage I-PER
. O
He O
had O
just O
put O
a O
costly O
board O
floor O
in O
his B-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
he O
said O
. O
During O
the O
early O
spring O
he O
had O
refrained O
from O
adding O
extensively O
to O
the O
comfort O
of O
his O
environment O
because O
he O
had O
felt O
that O
the B-ORG
army I-ORG
might O
start O
on O
the O
march O
at O
any O
moment O
. O
Of O
late O
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
been O
impressed O
that O
they O
were O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
eternal B-FAC
camp I-FAC
. O
Many B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
men I-PER
engaged O
in O
a O
spirited O
debate O
. O
One O
outlined O
in O
a O
peculiarly O
lucid O
manner O
all O
the O
plans O
of O
the B-PER
commanding I-PER
general I-PER
. O
He O
was O
opposed O
by O
men B-PER
who I-PER
advocated I-PER
that I-PER
there I-PER
were I-PER
other I-PER
plans I-PER
of I-PER
campaign I-PER

They O
clamored O
at O
each O

numbers O
making O
futile O
bids O
for O
the O
popular O
attention O

Meanwhile O
, O
the B-PER
soldier I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
fetched I-PER
the I-PER
rumor I-PER
bustled O
about O
with O
much O
importance O

" O
There O
was O
much O
food O
for O
thought O
in O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
replied O
. O
He O
came O
near O
to O
convincing O
them O
by O
disdaining O
to O
produce O
proofs O
. O
They O
grew O
much O
excited O
over O
it O
. O
There O
was O
a B-PER
youthful I-PER
private I-PER
who O
listened O
with O
eager O
ears O
to O
the O
words O
of O
the B-PER
tall I-PER
soldier I-PER
and O
to O
the O
varied O
comments O
of O
his B-PER
comrades I-PER
. O
After O
receiving O
a O
fill O
of O
discussions O
concerning O
marches O
and O
attacks O
, O
he O
went O
to O
his B-FAC
hut I-FAC
and O
crawled O
through O
an O
intricate O
hole O
that O
served O
it O
as O
a O
door O
. O
He O
wished O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
some O
new O
thoughts O
that O
had O
lately O
come O
to O
him O
. O
He O
lay O
down O
on O
a O
wide O
bunk O
that O
stretched O
across O
the O
end O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
In O
the O
other O
end O
, O
cracker O
boxes O
were O
made O
to O
serve O
as O
furniture O
. O
They O
were O
grouped O
about O
the O
fireplace O
. O
A O
picture O
from O
an O
illustrated O
weekly O
was O
upon O
the O
log O
walls O
, O
and O
three O
rifles O
were O
paralleled O
on O
pegs O
. O
Equipments O
hung O
on O
handy O
projections O
, O
and O
some O
tin O
dishes O
lay O
upon O
a O
small O
pile O
of O
firewood O
. O
A B-FAC
folded I-FAC
tent I-FAC
was O
serving O
as O
a O
roof O
. O
The O
sunlight O
, O
without O
, O
beating O
upon O
it O
, O
made O
it O
glow O
a O
light O
yellow O
shade O
. O
A O
small O
window O
shot O
an O
oblique O
square O
of O
whiter O
light O
upon O
the O
cluttered O
floor O
. O
The O
smoke O
from O
the O
fire O
at O
times O
neglected O
the O
clay O
chimney O
and O
wreathed O
into O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
and O
this O
flimsy O
chimney O
of O
clay O
and O
sticks O
made O
endless O
threats O
to O
set O
ablaze O
the B-FAC
whole I-FAC
establishment I-FAC
. O
The B-PER
youth I-PER
was O
in O
a O
little O
trance O
of O
astonishment O
. O
So O
they O
were O
at O
last O
going O
to O
fight O
. O
On O
the O
morrow O
, O
perhaps O
, O
there O
would O
be O
a O
battle O
, O
and O
he O
would O
be O
in O
it O
. O
For O
a O
time O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
labor O
to O
make O
himself O
believe O
. O
He O
could O
not O
accept O
with O
assurance O
an O
omen O
that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
mingle O
in O
one O
of O
those O
great O
affairs O
of O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
. O
He O
had O
, O
of O
course O
, O
dreamed O
of O
battles O
all O
his O
life O
-- O
of O
vague O
and O
bloody O
conflicts O
that O
had O
thrilled O
him O
with O
their O
sweep O
and O
fire O
. O
In O
visions O
he O
had O
seen O
himself O
in O
many O
struggles O
. O
He O
had O
imagined O
peoples B-PER
secure I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
shadow I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
eagle-eyed I-PER
prowess I-PER
. O
But O
awake O
he O
had O
regarded O
battles O
as O
crimson O
blotches O
on O
the O
pages O
of O
the O
past O
. O
He O
had O
put O
them O
as O
things O
of O
the O
bygone O
with O
his O
thought-images O
of O
heavy O
crowns O
and O
high B-FAC
castles I-FAC
. O
There O
was O
a O
portion O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
's O
history O
which O
he O
had O
regarded O
as O
the O
time O
of O
wars O
, O
but O
it O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
had O
been O
long O
gone O
over O
the O
horizon O
and O
had O
disappeared O
forever O
. O
From O
his B-FAC
home I-FAC
his O
youthful O
eyes O
had O
looked O
upon O
the O
war O
in O
his B-GPE
own I-GPE
country I-GPE
with O
distrust O
. O
It O
must O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
play O
affair O
. O
He O
had O
long O
despaired O
of O
witnessing O
a O
Greeklike O
struggle O
. O
Such O
would O
be O
no O
more O
, O
he O
had O
said O
. O
Men B-PER
were O
better O
, O
or O
more O
timid O
. O
Secular O
and O
religious O
education O
had O
effaced O
the O
throat-grappling O
instinct O
, O
or O
else O
firm O
finance O
held O
in O
check O
the O
passions O
. O
He O
had O
burned O
several O
times O
to O
enlist O
. O
Tales O
of O
great O
movements O
shook O
the O
land O
. O
They O
might O
not O
be O
distinctly O
Homeric O
, O
but O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
much O
glory O
in O
them O
. O
He O
had O
read O
of O
marches O
, O
sieges O
, O
conflicts O
, O
and O
he O
had O
longed O
to O
see O
it O
all O
. O
His O
busy O
mind O
had O
drawn O
for O
him O
large O
pictures O
extravagant O
in O
color O
, O
lurid O
with O
breathless O
deeds O
. O
But O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
discouraged O
him O
. O
She O
had O
affected O
to O
look O
with O
some O
contempt O
upon O
the O
quality O
of O
his O
war O
ardor O
and O
patriotism O
. O
She O
could O
calmly O
seat O
herself O
and O
with O
no O
apparent O
difficulty O
give O
him O
many O
hundreds O
of O
reasons O
why O
he O
was O
of O
vastly O
more O
importance O
on O
the B-FAC
farm I-FAC
than O
on O
the B-FAC
field I-FAC
of I-FAC
battle I-FAC
. O
She O
had O
had O
certain O
ways O
of O
expression O
that O
told O
him O
that O
her O
statements O
on O
the O
subject O
came O
from O
a O
deep O
conviction O
. O
Moreover O
, O
on O
her O
side O
, O
was O
his O
belief O
that O
her O
ethical O
motive O
in O
the O
argument O
was O
impregnable O
. O
At O
last O
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
made O
firm O
rebellion O
against O
this O
yellow O
light O
thrown O
upon O
the O
color O
of O
his O
ambitions O
. O
The O
newspapers O
, O
the O
gossip O
of O
the B-GPE
village I-GPE
, O
his O
own O
picturings O
, O
had O
aroused O
him O
to O
an O
uncheckable O
degree O
. O
They O
were O
in O
truth O
fighting O
finely O
down O
there O
. O
Almost O
every O
day O
the O
newspaper O
printed O
accounts O
of O
a O
decisive O
victory O
. O
One O
night O
, O
as O
he O
lay O
in O
bed O
, O
the O
winds O
had O
carried O
to O
him O
the O
clangoring O
of O
the O
church O
bell O
as O
some B-PER
enthusiast I-PER
jerked O
the O
rope O
frantically O
to O
tell O
the O
twisted O
news O
of O
a O
great O
battle O
. O
This O
voice O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
rejoicing I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
night I-PER
had O
made O
him O
shiver O
in O
a O
prolonged O
ecstasy O
of O
excitement O
. O
Later O
, O
he O
had O
gone O
down O
to O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
room O
and O
had O
spoken O
thus O
: O
" O
Ma O
, O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
enlist O
. O
" O
" O
Henry B-PER
, O
do O
n't O
you O
be O
a O
fool O
, O
" O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
replied O
. O
She O
had O
then O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
the O
quilt O
. O
There O
was O
an O
end O
to O
the O
matter O
for O
that O
night O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
next O
morning O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
a O
town O
that O
was O
near O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
farm O
and O
had O
enlisted O
in O
a O
company O
that O
was O
forming O
there B-GPE
. O
When O
he O
had O
returned O
home B-FAC
his B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
milking O
the O
brindle O
cow O
. O
Four O
others O
stood O
waiting O
. O
" O
Ma O
, O
I O
've O
enlisted O
, O
" O
he O
had O
said O
to O
her O
diffidently O
. O
There O
was O
a O
short O
silence O
. O
" O
The O
Lord O
's O
will O
be O
done O
, O
Henry B-PER
, O
" O
she O
had O
finally O
replied O
, O
and O
had O
then O
continued O
to O
milk O
the O
brindle O
cow O
. O
When O
he O
had O
stood O
in O
the O
doorway O
with O
his B-PER
soldier I-PER
's O
clothes O
on O
his O
back O
, O
and O
with O
the O
light O
of O
excitement O
and O
expectancy O
in O
his O
eyes O
almost O
defeating O
the O
glow O
of O
regret O
for O
the O
home B-FAC
bonds O
, O
he O
had O
seen O
two O
tears O
leaving O
their O
trails O
on O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
's O
scarred O
cheeks O
. O
Still O
, O
she O
had O
disappointed O
him O
by O
saying O
nothing O
whatever O
about O
returning O
with O
his O
shield O
or O
on O
it O
. O
He O
had O
privately O
primed O
himself O
for O
a O
beautiful O
scene O
. O
He O
had O
prepared O
certain O
sentences O
which O
he O
thought O
could O
be O
used O
with O
touching O
effect O
. O
But O
her O
words O
destroyed O
his O
plans O
. O
She O
had O
doggedly O
peeled O
potatoes O
and O
addressed O
him O
as O
follows O
: O
" O

A O
mist O

about O

on O
the B-LOC
gray I-LOC

under O

The B-FAC

were O
set O

some O

the O

under O

well O

The B-FAC

a O
deeply O

On O
the B-FAC

of O

sat O
a B-PER
little I-PER
Swede I-PER

crying O
bitterly O

He O
was O
about O
five O
years O
old O

His O
black O
cloth O

was O
much O

big O
for O
him O

made O
him O
look O

a B-PER
little I-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER

His O
shrunken O
brown O

His O

his O

red O

He O
cried O
quietly O

the B-PER
few I-PER

did O
not O

afraid O
to O
go O
into O
the B-FAC

ask O

he O
sat O
wringing O
his O

up O
a O

beside O
him O
, O
whimpering O
, O
“ O
My O
kitten O
, O
oh O
, O
my O
kitten O
! O
Her O
will O
fweeze O
! O
” O
At O
the O
top O
of O
the O
pole O
crouched O
a O
shivering O
gray O
kitten O
, O
mewing O
faintly O
and O
clinging O
desperately O
to O
the O
wood O
with O
her O
claws O
. O
The B-PER
boy I-PER
had O
been O
left O
at O
the B-FAC
store I-FAC
while O
his B-PER
sister I-PER
went O
to O
the B-FAC
doctor I-FAC
's I-FAC
office I-FAC
, O
and O
in O
her O
absence O
a O
dog O
had O
chased O
his O
kitten O
up O
the O
pole O
. O
The O
little O
creature O
had O
never O
been O
so O
high O
before O
, O
and O
she O
was O
too O
frightened O
to O
move O
. O
Her B-PER
master I-PER
was O
sunk O
in O
despair O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
little I-PER
country I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
and O
this B-GPE
village I-GPE
was O
to O
him O
a O
very O
strange O
and O
perplexing O
place O
, O
where O
people B-PER
wore O
fine O
clothes O
and O
had O
hard O
hearts O
. O
He O
always O
felt O
shy O
and O
awkward O
here B-GPE
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
hide O
behind O
things O
for O
fear O
some O
one O
might O
laugh O
at O
him O
. O
Just O
now O
, O
he O
was O
too O
unhappy O
to O
care O
who O
laughed O
. O
At O
last O
he O
seemed O
to O
see O
a O
ray O
of O
hope O
: O
his B-PER
sister I-PER
was O
coming O
, O
and O
he O
got O
up O
and O
ran O
toward O
her O
in O
his O
heavy O
shoes O
. O
His B-PER
sister I-PER
was O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
strong I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
and O
she O
walked O
rapidly O
and O
resolutely O
, O
as O
if O
she O
knew O
exactly O
where O
she O
was O
going O
and O
what O
she O
was O
going O
to O
do O
next O
. O
She O
wore O
a B-PER
man I-PER
's O
long O
ulster O
( O
not O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
affliction O
, O
but O
as O
if O
it O
were O
very O
comfortable O
and O
belonged O
to O
her O
; O
carried O
it O
like O
a B-PER
young I-PER
soldier I-PER
) O
, O
and O
a O
round O
plush O
cap O
, O
tied O
down O
with O
a O
thick O
veil O
. O
She O
had O
a O
serious O
, O
thoughtful O
face O
, O
and O
her O
clear O
, O
deep O
blue O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
intently O
on O
the O
distance O
, O
without O
seeming O
to O
see O
anything O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
in O
trouble O
. O
She O
did O
not O
notice O
the B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
until O
he O
pulled O
her O
by O
the O
coat O
. O
Then O
she O
stopped O
short O
and O
stooped O
down O
to O
wipe O
his O
wet O
face O
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
Emil B-PER
! O
I O
told O
you O
to O
stay O
in O
the B-FAC
store I-FAC
and O
not O
to O
come O
out O
. O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
? O
” O
“ O
My O
kitten O
, O
sister B-PER
, O
my O
kitten O
! O
A B-PER
man I-PER
put O
her O
out O
, O
and O
a O
dog O
chased O
her O
up O
there O
. O
” O
His O
forefinger O
, O
projecting O
from O
the O
sleeve O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
pointed O
up O
to O
the O
wretched O
little O
creature O
on O
the O
pole O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Emil B-PER
! O
Did O
n't O
I O
tell O
you O
she O
'd O
get O
us O
into O
trouble O
of O
some O
kind O
, O
if O
you O
brought O
her O
? O
What O
made O
you O
tease O
me O
so O
? O
But O
there O
, O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
better O
myself O
. O
” O
She O
went O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
pole O
and O
held O
out O
her O
arms O
, O
crying O
, O
“ O
Kitty O
, O
kitty O
, O
kitty O
, O
” O
but O
the O
kitten O
only O
mewed O
and O
faintly O
waved O
its O
tail O
. O
Alexandra B-PER
turned O
away O
decidedly O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
she O
wo O
n't O
come O
down O
. O
Somebody O
will O
have O
to O
go O
up O
after O
her O
. O
I O
saw O
the B-PER
Linstrums I-PER
' O
wagon O
in O
town B-GPE
. O
I O
'll O
go O
and O
see O
if O
I O
can O
find O
Carl B-PER
. O
Maybe O
he O
can O
do O
something O
. O
Only O
you O
must O
stop O
crying O
, O
or O
I O
wo O
n't O
go O
a O
step O
. O
Where O
's O
your O
comforter O
? O
Did O
you O
leave O
it O
in O
the B-FAC
store I-FAC
? O
Never O
mind O
. O
Hold O
still O
, O
till O
I O
put O
this O
on O
you O
. O
” O
She O
unwound O
the O
brown O
veil O
from O
her O
head O
and O
tied O
it O
about O
his O
throat O
. O
A O
shabby O
little O
traveling O
man O
, O
who O
was O
just O
then O
coming O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
store I-FAC
on O
his O
way O
to O
the B-FAC
saloon I-FAC
, O
stopped O
and O
gazed O
stupidly O
at O
the O
shining O
mass O
of O
hair O
she O
bared O
when O
she O
took O
off O
her O
veil O
; O
two O
thick O
braids O
, O
pinned O
about O
her O
head O
in O
the O
German O
way O
, O
with O
a O
fringe O
of O
reddish-yellow O
curls O
blowing O
out O
from O
under O
her O
cap O
. O
He O
took O
his O
cigar O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
held O
the O
wet O
end O
between O
the O
fingers O
of O
his O
woolen O
glove O
. O
“ O
My B-PER
God I-PER
, O
girl B-PER
, O
what O
a O
head O
of O
hair O
! O
” O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
quite O
innocently O
and O
foolishly O
. O
She O
stabbed O
him O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
Amazonian O
fierceness O
and O
drew O
in O
her O
lower O
lip O
-- O
most O
unnecessary O
severity O
. O
It O
gave O
the B-PER
little I-PER
clothing I-PER
drummer I-PER
such O
a O
start O
that O
he O
actually O
let O
his O
cigar O
fall O
to O
the B-FAC
sidewalk I-FAC
and O
went O
off O
weakly O
in O
the O
teeth O
of O
the O
wind O
to O
the B-FAC
saloon I-FAC
. O
His O
hand O
was O
still O
unsteady O
when O
he O
took O
his O
glass O
from O
the B-PER
bartender I-PER
. O
His O
feeble O
flirtatious O
instincts O
had O
been O
crushed O
before O
, O
but O
never O
so O
mercilessly O
. O
He O
felt O
cheap O
and O
ill-used O
, O
as O
if O
some O
one O
had O
taken O
advantage O
of O
him O
. O
When O
a B-PER
drummer I-PER
had O
been O
knocking O
about O
in O
little B-GPE
drab I-GPE
towns I-GPE
and O
crawling O
across O
the B-LOC
wintry I-LOC
country I-LOC
in O
dirty B-VEH
smoking-cars I-VEH
, O
was O
he O
to O
be O
blamed O
if O
, O
when O
he O
chanced O
upon O
a B-PER
fine I-PER
human I-PER
creature I-PER
, O
he O
suddenly O
wished O
himself O
more O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
? O
While O
the B-PER
little I-PER
drummer I-PER
was O
drinking O
to O
recover O
his O
nerve O
, O
Alexandra B-PER
hurried O
to O
the B-FAC
drug I-FAC
store I-FAC
as O
the O
most O
likely O
place O
to O
find O
Carl B-PER
Linstrum I-PER
. O
There B-FAC
he O
was O
, O
turning O
over O
a O
portfolio O
of O
chromo O
“ O
studies O
” O
which O
the B-PER
druggist I-PER
sold O
to O
the O
Hanover B-GPE
women O
who O
did O
china-painting O
. O
Alexandra B-PER
explained O
her O
predicament O
, O
and O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
followed O
her O
to O
the O
corner O
, O
where O
Emil B-PER
still O
sat O
by O
the O
pole O
. O
“ O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
go O
up O
after O
her O
, O
Alexandra B-PER
. O
I O
think O
at O
the B-FAC
depot I-FAC
they O
have O
some O
spikes O
I O
can O
strap O
on O
my O
feet O
. O
Wait O
a O
minute O
. O
” O
Carl B-PER
thrust O
his O
hands O
into O
his O
pockets O
, O
lowered O
his O
head O
, O
and O
darted O
up O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
against O
the O
north O
wind O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
boy I-PER
of I-PER
fifteen I-PER
, I-PER
slight I-PER
and I-PER
narrow-chested I-PER
. O
When O
he O
came O
back O
with O
the O
spikes O
, O
Alexandra B-PER
asked O
him O
what O
he O
had O
done O
with O
his O
overcoat O
. O
“ O
I O
left O
it O
in O
the B-FAC
drug I-FAC
store I-FAC
. O
I O
could O
n't O
climb O
in O
it O
, O
anyhow O
. O
Catch O
me O
if O
I O
fall O
, O
Emil B-PER
, O
” O
he O
called O
back O
as O
he O
began O
his O
ascent O
. O
Alexandra B-PER
watched O
him O
anxiously O
; O
the O
cold O
was O
bitter O
enough O
on O
the B-LOC
ground I-LOC
. O
The O
kitten O
would O
not O
budge O
an O
inch O
. O
Carl B-PER
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
very O
top O
of O
the O
pole O
, O
and O
then O
had O
some O
difficulty O
in O
tearing O
her O
from O
her O
hold O
. O
When O
he O
reached O
the B-LOC
ground I-LOC
, O
he O
handed O
the O
cat O
to O
her B-PER
tearful I-PER
little I-PER
master I-PER
. O
“ O
Now O
go O
into O
the B-FAC
store I-FAC
with O
her O
, O
Emil B-PER
, O
and O
get O
warm O
. O
” O
He O
opened O
the O
door O
for O
the B-PER
child I-PER
. O
“ O
Wait O
a O
minute O
, O
Alexandra B-PER
. O
Why O
ca O
n't O
I O
drive O
for O
you O
as O
far O
as O
our B-FAC
place I-FAC
? O
It O
's O
getting O
colder O
every O
minute O
. O
Have O
you O
seen O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
. O
He O
is O
coming O
over O
to-morrow O
. O
But O
he O
says O
father B-PER
ca O
n't O
get O
better O
; O
ca O
n't O
get O
well O
. O
” O
The B-PER
girl I-PER
's O
lip O
trembled O
. O
She O
looked O
fixedly O
up O
the B-FAC
bleak I-FAC
street I-FAC
as O
if O
she O
were O
gathering O
her O
strength O
to O
face O
something O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
trying O
with O
all O
her O
might O
to O
grasp O
a O
situation O
which O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
painful O
, O
must O
be O
met O
and O
dealt O
with O
somehow O
. O
The O
wind O
flapped O
the O
skirts O
of O
her O
heavy O
coat O
about O
her O
. O
Carl B-PER
did O
not O
say O
anything O
, O
but O
she O
felt O
his O
sympathy O
. O
He O
, O
too O
, O
was O
lonely O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
thin I-PER
, I-PER
frail I-PER
boy I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
brooding I-PER
dark I-PER
eyes I-PER
, O
very O
quiet O
in O
all O
his O
movements O
. O
There O
was O
a O
delicate O
pallor O
in O
his O
thin O
face O
, O
and O
his O
mouth O
was O
too O
sensitive O
for O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
's O
. O
The O
lips O
had O
already O
a O
little O
curl O
of O
bitterness O
and O
skepticism O
. O
The B-PER
two I-PER
friends I-PER
stood O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
on O
the B-FAC
windy I-FAC
street I-FAC
corner I-FAC
, O
not O
speaking O
a O
word O
, O
as O
two B-PER
travelers I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
have I-PER
lost I-PER
their I-PER
way I-PER
, I-PER
sometimes I-PER
stand I-PER
and I-PER
admit I-PER
their I-PER
perplexity I-PER
in I-PER
silence I-PER
. O
When O
Carl B-PER
turned O
away O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
'll O
see O
to O
your O
team O
. O
” O
Alexandra B-PER
went O
into O
the B-FAC
store I-FAC
to O
have O
her O
purchases O
packed O
in O
the O
egg-boxes O
, O
and O
to O
get O
warm O
before O
she O
set O
out O
on O
her O
long O
cold O
drive O
. O
When O
she O
looked O
for O
Emil B-PER
, O
she O
found O
him O
sitting O
on O
a O
step O
of O
the B-FAC
staircase I-FAC
that I-FAC
led I-FAC
up I-FAC
to I-FAC
the I-FAC
clothing I-FAC
and I-FAC
carpet I-FAC
department I-FAC

He O
was O
playing O
with O
a B-PER
little I-PER
Bohemian I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
Marie B-PER
Tovesky I-PER
, O
who O
was O
tying O
her O
handkerchief O
over O
the O
kitten O
's O
head O
for O
a O
bonnet O
. O
Marie B-PER
was O
a O
stranger O
in O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
having O
come O
from O
Omaha B-GPE
with O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
to O
visit O
her B-PER
uncle I-PER
, O
Joe B-PER
Tovesky I-PER

She O
was O
a B-PER
dark I-PER
child I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
brown I-PER
curly I-PER
hair I-PER
, I-PER
like I-PER
a I-PER

a I-PER
coaxing I-PER
little I-PER

round I-PER

yellow-brown I-PER
eyes I-PER

Every B-PER
one I-PER
noticed O
her O
eyes O
; O
the O
brown O
iris O
had O
golden O
glints O
that O
made O
them O
look O
like O
gold-stone O

PROLOGUE O
THE O
STORMING O
OF O
SERINGAPATAM B-GPE
( O
1799 O
) O
Extracted O
from O
a O
Family O
Paper O
I O
address O
these O
lines O
-- O
written O
in O
India B-GPE
-- O
to O
my O
relatives O
in O
England B-GPE
. O
My O
object O
is O
to O
explain O
the O
motive O
which O
has O
induced O
me O
to O
refuse O
the O
right O
hand O
of O
friendship O
to O
my B-PER
cousin I-PER
, O
John B-PER
Herncastle I-PER
. O
The O
reserve O
which O
I O
have O
hitherto O
maintained O
in O
this O
matter O
has O
been O
misinterpreted O
by O
members O
of O
my B-PER
family I-PER
whose O
good O
opinion O
I O
can O
not O
consent O
to O
forfeit O
. O
I O
request O
them O
to O
suspend O
their O
decision O
until O
they O
have O
read O
my O
narrative O
. O
And O
I O
declare O
, O
on O
my O
word O
of O
honour O
, O
that O
what O
I O
am O
now O
about O
to O
write O
is O
, O
strictly O
and O
literally O
, O
the O
truth O
. O
The O
private O
difference O
between O
my B-PER
cousin I-PER
and O
me O
took O
its O
rise O
in O
a O
great O
public O
event O
in O
which O
we O
were O
both O
concerned O
-- O
the O
storming O
of O
Seringapatam B-GPE
, O
under O
General B-PER
Baird O
, O
on O
the O
4th O
of O
May O
, O
1799 O
. O
In O
order O
that O
the O
circumstances O
may O
be O
clearly O
understood O
, O
I O
must O
revert O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
the O
period O
before O
the O
assault O
, O
and O
to O
the O
stories O
current O
in O
our B-FAC
camp I-FAC
of O
the O
treasure O
in O
jewels O

stored O
up O
in O

II O
One O
of O
the O
wildest O
of O
these O
stories O
related O
to O
a O
Yellow O
Diamond O
-- O
a O
famous O
gem O
in O
the O
native O
annals O
of O
India B-GPE
. O
The O
earliest O
known O
traditions O
describe O
the O
stone O
as O
having O
been O
set O
in O
the O
forehead O
of O
the B-PER
four-handed I-PER
Indian I-PER
god I-PER
who I-PER
typifies I-PER
the I-PER
Moon I-PER
. O
Partly O
from O
its O
peculiar O
colour O
, O
partly O
from O
a O
superstition O
which O
represented O
it O
as O
feeling O
the O
influence O
of O
the B-PER
deity I-PER
whom I-PER
it I-PER
adorned I-PER
, O
and O
growing O
and O
lessening O
in O
lustre O
with O
the O
waxing O
and O
waning O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
it O
first O
gained O
the O
name O
by O
which O
it O
continues O
to O
be O
known O
in O
India B-GPE
to O
this O
day O
-- O
the O
name O
of O
THE O
MOONSTONE O
. O
A O
similar O
superstition O
was O
once O
prevalent O
, O
as O
I O
have O

on O
the O
night O
when O

, O
Vishnu B-PER
the B-PER
Preserver I-PER
appeared O
to O
the B-PER
three I-PER
Brahmins I-PER
in O
a O
dream O

The B-PER
deity I-PER
breathed O
the O
breath O
of O
his O
divinity O
on O
the O
Diamond O
in O
the O
forehead O
of O

And O
the B-PER
Brahmins I-PER
knelt O
and O
hid O
their O
faces O
in O
their O
robes O
. O
The B-PER
deity I-PER
commanded O
that O

time O

And O
the B-PER
Brahmins I-PER
heard O
, O

bowed O
before O

The B-PER
deity I-PER
predicted O
certain O
disaster O

the B-PER
presumptuous I-PER
mortal I-PER

written O
over O

One O

and O
still O
, O
generation O

generation O
, O
the O
successors O
of O
the B-PER
three I-PER
Brahmins I-PER
watched O
their O
priceless O
Moonstone O
, O
night O

day O
. O
One O
age O
followed O
another O
until O
the O
first O
years O
of O
the O
eighteenth O
Christian O

saw O
the O
reign O
of O
Aurungzebe B-PER

Emperor O
of O

At O
his O
command O
havoc O

were O
let O

once O

temples O
of O
the O

The O
shrine O
of O
the B-PER

was O
polluted O
by O
the O
slaughter O
of O
sacred O
animals O
; O
the O
images O
of O

broken O

the O

an O

Aurungzebe B-PER

Powerless O
to O
recover O
their O
lost O
treasure O
by O
open O
force O
, O
the B-PER
three I-PER
guardian I-PER
priests I-PER
followed O

watched O
it O
in O

The O
generations O
succeeded O
each O
other O
; O
the B-PER
warrior I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
committed I-PER
the I-PER
sacrilege I-PER
perished O
miserably O
; O
the O
Moonstone O
passed O
( O
carrying O
its O
curse O

it O

from O
one O
lawless O
Mohammedan O
hand O
to O
another O
; O
and O
still O
, O
through O
all O
chances O
and O
changes O
, O
the O
successors O
of O
the B-PER
three I-PER
guardian I-PER
priests I-PER
kept O
their O
watch O
, O
waiting O
the O
day O
when O
the O
will O
of O
Vishnu B-PER
the B-PER
Preserver I-PER
should O
restore O
to O
them O
their O
sacred O
gem O

Time O
rolled O
on O
from O
the O
first O
to O
the O
last O
years O
of O
the O
eighteenth O
Christian O
century O
. O
The O
Diamond O
fell O
into O
the O
possession O
of O
Tippoo B-PER
, O
Sultan O
of O
Seringapatam B-GPE
, O
who O
caused O
it O
to O
be O
placed O
as O
an O
ornament O
in O
the O
handle O
of O
a O
dagger O
, O
and O
who O
commanded O
it O
to O
be O
kept O
among O
the O
choicest O
treasures O
of O
his O
armoury O
. O
Even O
then O
-- O
in O
the O
palace O
of O
the B-PER
Sultan I-PER
himself O
-- O
the B-PER
three I-PER
guardian I-PER
priests I-PER
still O
kept O
their O
watch O
in O
secret O
. O
There O
were O
three O
officers O
of O
Tippoo B-PER
’s O
household O
, O
strangers O
to O
the B-PER
rest I-PER
, O
who O
had O
won O
their O
master O
’s O
confidence O
by O
conforming O
, O
or O
appearing O
to O
conform O
, O
to O
the O
Mussulman O
faith O
; O
and O
to O
those B-PER
three I-PER
men I-PER
report O
pointed O
as O
the B-PER
three I-PER
priests I-PER
in I-PER
disguise I-PER
. O
III O
So O
, O
as O
told O
in O
our B-FAC
camp I-FAC
, O
ran O
the O
fanciful O
story O
of O
the O
Moonstone O
. O
It O
made O
no O
serious O
impression O
on O
any O
of O
us O
except O
my B-PER
cousin I-PER
-- O
whose O
love O
of O
the O
marvellous O
induced O
him O
to O
believe O
it O
. O
On O
the O
night O
before O
the O
assault O
on O
Seringapatam B-GPE
, O
he O
was O
absurdly O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
and O
with O
others O
, O
for O
treating O
the O
whole O
thing O
as O
a O
fable O
. O
A O
foolish O
wrangle O
followed O
; O
and O
Herncastle B-PER
’s O
unlucky O
temper O
got O
the O
better O
of O
him O
. O
He O
declared O
, O
in O
his O
boastful O
way O
, O
that O
we O
should O
see O
the O
Diamond O
on O
his O
finger O
, O
if O
the B-PER
English I-PER
army I-PER
took O
Seringapatam B-PER
. O
The O
sally O
was O
saluted O
by O
a O
roar O
of O
laughter O
, O
and O
there O
, O
as O
we O
all O
thought O
that O
night O
, O
the O
thing O
ended O
. O
Let O
me O
now O
take O
you O
on O
to O
the O
day O
of O
the O
assault O
. O
My B-PER
cousin I-PER
and O
I O
were O
separated O
at O
the O
outset O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
when O
we O
forded O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
; O
when O
we O
planted O
the O
English O
flag O
in O
the O
first O
breach O
; O
when O
we O
crossed O
the O
ditch O
beyond O
; O
and O
, O
fighting O
every O
inch O
of O
our O
way O
, O
entered O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
. O
It O
was O
only O
at O
dusk O
, O
when O
the B-GPE
place I-GPE
was O
ours O
, O
and O
after O
General B-PER
Baird O
himself O
had O
found O
the O
dead O
body O
of O
Tippoo B-PER
under O
a O
heap O
of O
the B-PER
slain I-PER
, O
that O
Herncastle B-PER
and O
I O
met O
. O
We O
were O
each O
attached O
to O
a O
party O
sent O
out O
by O
the B-PER
general I-PER
’s O
orders O
to O
prevent O
the O
plunder O
and O
confusion O
which O
followed O
our O
conquest O
. O
The B-PER
camp-followers I-PER
committed O
deplorable O
excesses O
; O
and O
, O
worse O
still O
, O
the B-PER
soldiers I-PER
found O
their O
way O
, O
by O
a O
guarded O
door O
, O
into O
the O
treasury O
of O
the B-FAC
Palace I-FAC
, O
and O
loaded O
themselves O
with O
gold O
and O
jewels O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
court O
outside O
the B-FAC
treasury I-FAC
that O
my B-PER
cousin I-PER
and O
I O
met O
, O
to O
enforce O
the O
laws O
of O
discipline O
on O
our B-PER
own I-PER
soldiers I-PER
. O
Herncastle B-PER
’s O
fiery O
temper O
had O
been O
, O
as O
I O
could O
plainly O
see O
, O
exasperated O
to O
a O
kind O
of O
frenzy O
by O
the O
terrible O
slaughter O
through O
which O
we O
had O
passed O
. O
He O
was O
very O
unfit O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
to O
perform O
the O
duty O
that O
had O
been O
entrusted O
to O
him O
. O
There O
was O
riot O
and O
confusion O
enough O
in O
the B-FAC
treasury I-FAC
, O
but O
no O
violence O
that O
I O
saw O
. O
The B-PER
men I-PER
( O
if O
I O
may O
use O
such O
an O
expression O
) O
disgraced O
themselves O
good-humouredly O
. O
All O
sorts O
of O
rough O
jests O
and O
catchwords O
were O
bandied O
about O
among O
them O
; O
and O
the O
story O
of O
the O
Diamond O
turned O
up O
again O
unexpectedly O
, O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
mischievous O
joke O
. O
“ O
Who O
’s O
got O
the O
Moonstone O
? O
” O
was O
the O
rallying O
cry O
which O
perpetually O
caused O
the O
plundering O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
stopped O
in O
one O
place O
, O
to O
break O
out O
in O
another O
. O
While O
I O
was O
still O
vainly O
trying O
to O
establish O
order O
, O
I O
heard O
a O
frightful O
yelling O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
courtyard I-FAC
, O
and O
at O
once O
ran O
towards O
the O
cries O
, O
in O
dread O
of O
finding O
some O
new O
outbreak O
of O
the O
pillage O
in O
that O
direction O
. O
I O
got O
to O
an O
open O
door O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
bodies O
of O
two B-PER
Indians I-PER
( O
by O
their O
dress O
, O
as O
I O
guessed O
, O
officers B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
palace I-PER
) O
lying O
across O
the O
entrance O
, O
dead O
. O
A O
cry O
inside O
hurried O
me O
into O
a O
room O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
serve O
as O
an B-FAC
armoury I-FAC
. O
A B-PER
third I-PER
Indian I-PER
, I-PER
mortally I-PER
wounded I-PER
, O
was O
sinking O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
whose I-PER
back I-PER
was I-PER
towards I-PER
me I-PER
. O
The B-PER
man I-PER
turned O
at O
the O
instant O
when O
I O
came O
in O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
John B-PER
Herncastle I-PER
, O
with O
a O
torch O
in O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
a O
dagger O
dripping O
with O
blood O
in O
the O
other O
. O
A O
stone O
, O
set O
like O
a O
pommel O
, O
in O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dagger O
’s O
handle O
, O
flashed O
in O
the O
torchlight O
, O
as O
he O
turned O
on O
me O
, O
like O
a O
gleam O
of O
fire O
. O
The B-PER
dying I-PER
Indian I-PER
sank O
to O
his O
knees O
, O
pointed O
to O
the O
dagger O
in O
Herncastle B-PER
’s O
hand O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
his O
native O
language O
-- O
“ O
The O
Moonstone O
will O
have O
its O
vengeance O
yet O
on O
you O
and O
yours O
! O
” O
He O
spoke O
those O
words O
, O
and O
fell O
dead O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
Before O
I O
could O
stir O
in O
the O
matter O
, O
the O
men O
who O
had O
followed O
me O
across O
the B-FAC
courtyard I-FAC
crowded O
in O
. O
My B-PER
cousin I-PER
rushed O
to O
meet O
them O
, O
like O
a B-PER
madman I-PER
. O
“ O
Clear O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
! O
” O
he O
shouted O
to O
me O
, O
“ O
and O
set O
a B-PER
guard I-PER
on O
the O
door O
! O
” O
The B-PER
men I-PER
fell O
back O
as O
he O
threw O
himself O
on O
them O
with O
his O
torch O
and O
his O
dagger O
. O
I O
put O
two O
sentinels O
of O
my B-PER
own I-PER
company I-PER
, O
on O
whom O
I O
could O
rely O
, O
to O
keep O
the O
door O
. O
Through O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
night O
, O
I O
saw O
no O
more O
of O
my B-PER
cousin I-PER
. O
Early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
plunder O
still O
going O
on O
, O
General B-PER
Baird O
announced O
publicly O
by O
beat O
of O
drum O
, O
that O
any B-PER
thief I-PER
detected I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
fact I-PER
, O
be O
he O
whom O
he O
might O
, O
should O
be O
hung O
. O
The B-PER
provost-marshal I-PER
was O
in O
attendance O
, O
to O
prove O
that O
the B-PER
General I-PER
was O
in O
earnest O
; O
and O
in O
the O
throng O
that O
followed O
the O
proclamation O
, O
Herncastle B-PER
and O
I O
met O
again O
. O
He O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
said O
, O
“ O
Good O
morning O
. O
” O
I O
waited O
before O
I O
gave O
him O
my O
hand O
in O
return O
. O
“ O
Tell O
me O
first O
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
“ O
how O
the O
Indian O
in O
the B-FAC
armoury I-FAC
met O
his O
death O
, O
and O
what O
those O
last O
words O
meant O

when O
he O
pointed O
to O
the O
dagger O
in O
your O
hand O

” O
“ O
The B-PER
Indian I-PER
met O
his O
death O
, O
as O
I O
suppose O
, O
by O
a O
mortal O
wound O

” O
said O
Herncastle B-PER

“ O
What O
his O

meant O
I O
know O
no O
more O
than O
you O
do O

CHAPTER O
I O
PARIS B-GPE
: O
SEPTEMBER O
, O
1792 O
A O
surging O
, O
seething O
, O
murmuring O
crowd O
of O
beings O
that O
are O
human O
only O
in O
name O
, O
for O
to O
the O
eye O
and O
ear O
they O
seem O
naught O
but O
savage B-PER
creatures I-PER
, O
animated O
by O
vile O
passions O
and O
by O
the O
lust O
of O
vengeance O
and O
of O
hate O
. O
The O
hour O
, O
some O
little O
time O
before O
sunset O
, O
and O
the O
place O
, O
the O
West O
Barricade O
, O
at O
the O
very O
spot O
where O
, O
a O
decade O
later O
, O
a B-PER
proud I-PER
tyrant I-PER
raised O
an O
undying O
monument O
to O
the O
nation O
's O
glory O
and O
his O
own O
vanity O
. O
During O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
day O
the O
guillotine O
had O
been O
kept O
busy O
at O
its O
ghastly O
work O
: O
all O
that O
France B-GPE
had O
boasted O
of O
in O
the O
past O
centuries O
, O
of O
ancient O
names O
, O
and O
blue O
blood O
, O
had O
paid O
toll O
to O
her O
desire O
for O
liberty O
and O
for O
fraternity O
. O
The O
carnage O
had O
only O
ceased O
at O
this O
late O
hour O
of O
the O
day O
because O
there O
were O
other O
more O
interesting O
sights O
for O
the B-PER
people I-PER
to O
witness O
, O
a O
little O
while O
before O
the O
final O
closing O
of O
the O
barricades O
for O
the O
night O
. O
And O
so O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
rushed O
away O
from O
the B-FAC
Place I-FAC
de I-FAC
la I-FAC
Greve I-FAC
and O
made O
for O
the O
various O
barricades O
in O
order O
to O
watch O
this O
interesting O
and O
amusing O
sight O
. O
It O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
every O
day O
, O
for O
those B-PER
aristos I-PER
were O
such B-PER
fools I-PER
! O
They O
were O
traitors O
to O
the B-PER
people I-PER
of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
them O
, O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
, O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
descendants O
of O
the O
great O
men O
who O
since O
the O
Crusades O
had O
made O
the O
glory O
of O
France B-GPE
: O
her B-PER
old I-PER
NOBLESSE I-PER
. O
Their B-PER
ancestors I-PER
had O
oppressed O
the B-PER
people I-PER
, O
had O
crushed O
them O
under O
the O
scarlet O
heels O
of O
their O
dainty O
buckled O
shoes O
, O
and O
now O
the B-PER
people I-PER
had O
become O
the O
rulers O
of O
France B-GPE
and O
crushed O
their B-PER
former I-PER
masters I-PER
-- O
not O
beneath O
their O
heel O
, O
for O
they O
went O
shoeless O
mostly O
in O
these O
days O
-- O
but O
a O
more O
effectual O
weight O
, O
the O
knife O
of O
the O
guillotine O
. O
And O
daily O
, O
hourly O
, O
the O
hideous O
instrument O
of O
torture O
claimed O
its B-PER
many I-PER
victims I-PER
-- O
old B-PER
men I-PER
, O
young B-PER
women I-PER
, O
tiny B-PER
children I-PER
until O
the O
day O
when O
it O
would O
finally O
demand O
the O
head O
of O
a B-PER
King I-PER
and O
of O
a B-PER
beautiful I-PER
young I-PER
Queen I-PER
. O
But O
this O
was O
as O
it O
should O
be O
: O
were O
not O
the B-PER
people I-PER
now O
the O
rulers O
of O
France B-GPE
? O
Every B-PER
aristocrat I-PER
was O
a B-PER
traitor I-PER
, O
as O
his B-PER
ancestors I-PER
had O
been O
before O
him O
: O
for O
two O
hundred O
years O
now O
the B-PER
people I-PER
had O
sweated O
, O
and O
toiled O
, O
and O
starved O
, O
to O
keep O
a O
lustful O
court O
in O
lavish O
extravagance O
; O
now O
the O
descendants O
of O
those B-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
helped I-PER
to I-PER
make I-PER
those I-PER
courts I-PER
brilliant I-PER
had O
to O
hide O
for O
their O
lives O
-- O
to O
fly O
, O
if O
they O
wished O
to O
avoid O
the O
tardy O
vengeance O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
. O
And O
they O
did O
try O
to O
hide O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
fly O
: O
that O
was O
just O
the O
fun O
of O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O
Every O
afternoon O
before O
the O
gates O
closed O
and O
the B-VEH
market I-VEH
carts I-VEH
went O
out O
in O
procession O
by O
the O
various O
barricades O
, O
some O
fool O
of O
an B-PER
aristo I-PER
endeavoured O
to O
evade O
the O
clutches O
of O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
. O
In O
various O
disguises O
, O
under O
various O
pretexts O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
slip O
through O
the O
barriers O
, O
which O
were O
so O
well O
guarded O
by O
citizen O
soldiers O
of O
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
. O
Men O
in O
women B-PER
's O
clothes O
, O
women B-PER
in I-PER
male I-PER
attire I-PER
, O
children O
disguised O
in O
beggars B-PER
' O
rags O
: O
there O
were O
some O
of O
all O
sorts O
: O
CI-DEVANT O
counts O
, O
marquises O
, O
even O
dukes O
, O
who O
wanted O
to O
fly O
from O
France B-GPE
, O
reach O
England B-GPE
or O
some O
other O
equally O
accursed O
country O
, O
and O
there O
try O
to O
rouse O
foreign O
feelings O
against O
the O
glorious O
Revolution O
, O
or O
to O
raise O
an B-PER
army I-PER
in O
order O
to O
liberate O
the O
wretched O
prisoners O
in O
the B-FAC
Temple I-FAC
, O
who O
had O
once O
called O
themselves O
sovereigns O
of O
France B-GPE
. O
But O
they O
were O
nearly O
always O
caught O
at O
the O
barricades O
, O
Sergeant B-PER
Bibot O
especially O
at O
the B-FAC
West I-FAC
Gate I-FAC
had O
a O
wonderful O
nose O
for O
scenting O
an B-PER
aristo I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
most I-PER
perfect I-PER
disguise I-PER
. O
Then O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
fun O
began O
. O
Bibot B-PER
would O
look O
at O
his B-PER
prey I-PER
as O
a O
cat O
looks O
upon O
the O
mouse O
, O
play O
with O
him O
, O
sometimes O
for O
quite O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
pretend O
to O
be O
hoodwinked O
by O
the O
disguise O
, O
by O
the O
wigs O
and O
other O
bits O
of O
theatrical O
make-up O
which O
hid O
the O
identity O
of O
a B-PER
CI-DEVANT I-PER
noble I-PER
marquise I-PER
or I-PER
count I-PER
. O
Oh O
! O
Bibot B-PER
had O
a O
keen O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
and O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
hanging O
round O
that O
West O
Barricade O
, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
him O
catch O
an B-PER
aristo I-PER
in O
the O
very O
act O
of O
trying O
to O
flee O
from O
the O
vengeance O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
. O
Sometimes O
Bibot B-PER
would O
let O
his B-PER
prey I-PER
actually O
out O
by O
the O
gates O
, O
allowing O
him O
to O
think O
for O
the O
space O
of O
two O
minutes O
at O
least O
that O
he O
really O
had O
escaped O
out O
of O
Paris B-GPE
, O
and O
might O
even O
manage O
to O
reach O
the B-LOC
coast I-LOC
of O
England B-GPE
in O
safety O
, O
but O
Bibot B-PER
would O
let O
the B-PER
unfortunate I-PER
wretch I-PER
walk O
about O
ten O
metres O
towards O
the B-LOC
open I-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
then O
he O
would O
send O
two B-PER
men I-PER
after O
him O
and O
bring O
him O
back O
, O
stripped O
of O
his O
disguise O
. O
Oh O
! O
that O
was O
extremely O
funny O
, O
for O
as O
often O
as O
not O
the B-PER
fugitive I-PER
would O
prove O
to O
be O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
, O
some O
proud O
marchioness O
, O
who O
looked O
terribly O
comical O
when O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
Bibot B-PER
's O
clutches O
after O
all O
, O
and O
knew O
that O
a O
summary O
trial O
would O
await O
her O
the O
next O
day O
and O
after O
that O
, O
the O
fond O
embrace O
of O
Madame O
la O
Guillotine O
. O
No O
wonder O
that O
on O
this O
fine O
afternoon O
in O
September O
the O
crowd O
round O
Bibot B-PER
's O
gate O
was O
eager O
and O
excited O
. O
The O
lust O
of O
blood O
grows O
with O
its O
satisfaction O
, O
there O
is O
no O
satiety O
: O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
had O
seen O
a O
hundred O
noble O
heads O
fall O
beneath O
the O
guillotine O
to-day O
, O
it O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
would O
see O
another B-PER
hundred I-PER
fall O
on O
the O
morrow O
. O
Bibot B-PER
was O
sitting O
on O
an O
overturned O
and O
empty O
cask O
close O
by O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
barricade O
; O
a O
small O
detachment O
of O
citoyen B-PER
soldiers I-PER
was O
under O
his O
command O
. O
The O
work O
had O
been O
very O
hot O
lately O
. O
Those B-PER
cursed I-PER
aristos I-PER
were O
becoming O
terrified O
and O
tried O
their O
hardest O
to O
slip O
out O
of O
Paris B-GPE
: O
men O
, O
women O
and O
children O
, O
whose O
ancestors B-PER
, O
even O
in O
remote O
ages O
, O
had O
served O
those B-PER
traitorous I-PER
Bourbons I-PER
, O
were O
all O
traitors B-PER
themselves O
and O
right O
food O
for O
the O
guillotine O
. O
Every O
day O
Bibot B-PER
had O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
unmasking O
some B-PER
fugitive I-PER
royalists I-PER
and O
sending O
them O
back O
to O
be O
tried O
by O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
, O
presided O
over O
by O
that B-PER
good I-PER
patriot I-PER
, O
Citoyen B-PER
Foucquier-Tinville I-PER
. O
Robespierre B-PER
and O
Danton B-PER
both O
had O
commended O
Bibot B-PER
for O
his O
zeal O
and O
Bibot B-PER
was O
proud O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
on O
his O
own O
initiative O
had O
sent O
at B-PER
least I-PER
fifty I-PER
aristos I-PER
to O
the O
guillotine O
. O
But O
to-day O
all B-PER
the I-PER
sergeants I-PER
in I-PER
command I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
various I-PER
barricades I-PER
had O
had O
special O
orders O
. O
Recently O
a O
very O
great O
number O
of O
aristos B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
escaping O
out O
of O
France B-GPE
and O
in O
reaching O
England B-GPE
safely O
. O
There O
were O
curious O
rumours O
about O
these O
escapes O
; O
they O
had O
become O
very O
frequent O
and O
singularly O
daring O
; O
the B-PER
people I-PER
's O
minds O
were O
becoming O
strangely O
excited O
about O
it O
all O
. O
Sergeant B-PER
Grospierre O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
guillotine O
for O
allowing O
a B-PER
whole I-PER
family I-PER
of I-PER
aristos I-PER
to O
slip O
out O
of O
the O
North O
Gate O
under O
his O
very O
nose O
. O
It O
was O
asserted O
that O
these O
escapes O
were O
organised O
by O
a O
band O
of O
Englishmen O
, O
whose O
daring O
seemed O
to O
be O
unparalleled O
, O
and O
who O
, O
from O
sheer O
desire O
to O
meddle O
in O
what O
did O
not O
concern O
them O
, O
spent O
their O
spare O
time O
in O
snatching O
away O
lawful B-PER
victims I-PER
destined I-PER
for I-PER
Madame I-PER
la I-PER
Guillotine I-PER
. O
These O
rumours O
soon O
grew O
in O
extravagance O
; O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
this B-PER
band I-PER
of I-PER
meddlesome I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
did O
exist O
; O
moreover O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
whose I-PER
pluck I-PER
and I-PER
audacity I-PER
were I-PER
almost I-PER
fabulous I-PER
. O
Strange O
stories O
were O
afloat O
of O
how O
he O
and O
those B-PER
aristos I-PER
whom I-PER
he I-PER
rescued I-PER
became O
suddenly O
invisible O
as O
they O
reached O
the O
barricades O
and O
escaped O
out O
of O
the O
gates O
by O
sheer O
supernatural O
agency O
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
had O
seen O
these B-PER
mysterious I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
; O
as O
for O
their B-PER
leader I-PER
, O
he O
was O
never O
spoken O
of O
, O
save O
with O
a O
superstitious O
shudder O
. O
Citoyen B-PER
Foucquier-Tinville I-PER
would O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
receive O
a O
scrap O
of O
paper O
from O
some O
mysterious O
source O
; O
sometimes O
he O
would O
find O
it O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
at O
others O
it O
would O
be O
handed O
to O
him O
by O
someone O
in O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
, O
whilst O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
sitting O
of O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
. O
The O
paper O
always O
contained O
a O
brief O
notice O
that O
the B-PER
band I-PER
of I-PER
meddlesome I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
were O
at O
work O
, O
and O
it O
was O
always O
signed O
with O
a O
device O
drawn O
in O
red O
-- O
a O
little O
star-shaped O
flower O
, O
which O
we O
in O
England B-GPE
call O
the O
Scarlet O
Pimpernel O
. O
Within O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
the O
receipt O
of O
this O
impudent O
notice O
, O
the O
citoyens O
of O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
would O
hear O
that O
so B-PER
many I-PER
royalists I-PER
and I-PER
aristocrats I-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
reaching O
the B-LOC
coast I-LOC
, O
and O
were O
on O
their O
way O
to O
England B-GPE
and O
safety O
. O
The B-PER
guards I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
gates I-PER
had O
been O
doubled O
, O
the B-PER
sergeants I-PER
in I-PER
command I-PER
had O
been O
threatened O
with O
death O
, O
whilst O
liberal O
rewards O
were O
offered O
for O
the O
capture O
of O
these B-PER
daring I-PER
and I-PER
impudent I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
. O
There O
was O
a O
sum O
of O
five O
thousand O
francs O
promised O
to O
the O
man O
who O
laid O
hands O
on O
the B-PER
mysterious I-PER
and I-PER
elusive I-PER
Scarlet I-PER
Pimpernel I-PER
. O
Everyone B-PER
felt O
that O
Bibot B-PER
would O
be O
that B-PER
man I-PER
, O
and O
Bibot B-PER
allowed O
that O
belief O
to O
take O
firm O
root O
in O
everybody B-PER
's O
mind O
; O
and O
so O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
people B-PER
came O
to O
watch O
him O
at O
the B-FAC
West I-FAC
Gate I-FAC
, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
present O
when O
he O
laid O
hands O
on O
any O
fugitive O
aristo O
who O
perhaps O
might O
be O
accompanied O
by O
that B-PER
mysterious I-PER
Englishman I-PER
. O
“ O
Bah O
! O
” O
he O
said O
to O
his B-PER
trusted I-PER
corporal I-PER
, O
“ O
Citoyen B-PER
Grospierre I-PER
was O
a B-PER
fool I-PER
! O
Had O
it O
been O
me O
now O
, O
at O
that B-FAC
North I-FAC
Gate I-FAC
last O
week O
. O
. O
. O
” O
Citoyen B-PER
Bibot I-PER
spat O
on O
the O
ground O
to O
express O
his O
contempt O
for O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
's O
stupidity O
. O
“ O
How O
did O
it O
happen O
, O
citoyen O
? O
” O
asked O
the B-PER
corporal I-PER
. O
“ O
Grospierre B-PER
was O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
keeping O
good O
watch O
, O
” O
began O
Bibot B-PER
, O
pompously O
, O
as O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
closed O
in O
round O
him O
, O
listening O
eagerly O
to O
his O
narrative O
. O
“ O
We O
've O
all O
heard O
of O
this B-PER
meddlesome I-PER
Englishman I-PER
, O
this B-PER
accursed I-PER
Scarlet I-PER
Pimpernel I-PER

He O
wo O
n't O
get O
through O
MY O
gate O
, O
MORBLEU O
! O
unless O
he O
be O
the B-PER
devil I-PER
himself I-PER
. O
But O
Grospierre B-PER
was O
a B-PER
fool I-PER
. O
The B-VEH
market I-VEH
carts I-VEH
were O
going O
through O
the O
gates O
; O
there O
was O
one O
laden O
with O
casks O
, O
and O
driven O
by O
an B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
, O
with O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
beside I-PER
him I-PER
. O
Grospierre B-PER
was O
a O
bit O
drunk O
, O
but O
he O
thought O
himself O
very O
clever O
; O
he O
looked O
into O
the O
casks O
-- O
most O
of O
them O
, O
at O
least O
-- O
and O
saw O
they O
were O
empty O

and O
let O
the B-VEH
cart I-VEH
go O
through O
. O
” O
A O
murmur O
of O
wrath O
and O
contempt O
went O
round O
the O
group O
of O
ill-clad O
wretches O
, O
who O
crowded O
round O
Citoyen B-PER
Bibot I-PER
. O
“ O
Half O
an O
hour O
later O

continued O
the B-PER
sergeant I-PER

“ O
up O
comes O
a O

CHAPTER O
ONE O
PLAYING O
PILGRIMS B-PER
" O
Christmas O
wo O
n't O
be O
Christmas O
without O
any O
presents O
, O
" O
grumbled O
Jo B-PER
, O
lying O
on O
the O
rug O
. O
" O
It O
's O
so O
dreadful O
to O
be O
poor O
! O
" O
sighed O
Meg B-PER
, O
looking O
down O
at O
her O
old O
dress O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
fair O
for O
some B-PER
girls I-PER
to O
have O
plenty O
of O
pretty O
things O
, O
and O
other B-PER
girls I-PER
nothing O
at O
all O
, O
" O
added O
little B-PER
Amy I-PER
, O
with O
an O
injured O
sniff O
. O
" O
We O
've O
got O
Father B-PER
and O
Mother B-PER
, O
and O
each B-PER
other I-PER
, O
" O
said O
Beth B-PER
contentedly O
from O
her O
corner O
. O
The B-PER
four I-PER
young I-PER
faces I-PER
on I-PER
which I-PER
the I-PER
firelight I-PER
shone I-PER
brightened O
at O
the O
cheerful O
words O
, O
but O
darkened O
again O
as O
Jo B-PER
said O
sadly O
, O
" O
We O
have O
n't O
got O
Father B-PER
, O
and O
shall O
not O
have O
him O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
" O
She O
did O
n't O
say O
" O
perhaps O
never O
, O
" O
but O
each O
silently O
added O
it O
, O
thinking O
of O
Father B-PER
far O
away O
, O
where O
the O
fighting O
was O
. O
Nobody B-PER
spoke O
for O
a O
minute O
; O
then O
Meg B-PER
said O
in O
an O
altered O
tone O
, O
" O
You O
know O
the O
reason O
Mother B-PER
proposed O
not O
having O
any O
presents O
this B-PER
Christmas I-PER
was O
because O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
hard O
winter O
for O
everyone B-PER
; O
and O
she O
thinks O
we O
ought O
not O
to O
spend O
money O
for O
pleasure O
, O
when O
our B-PER
men I-PER
are O
suffering O
so O
in O
the O
army O
. O
We O
ca O
n't O
do O
much O
, O
but O
we O
can O
make O
our O
little O
sacrifices O
, O
and O
ought O
to O
do O
it O
gladly O
. O
But O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
" O
and O
Meg B-PER
shook O
her O
head O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
regretfully O
of O
all O
the O
pretty O
things O
she O
wanted O
. O
" O
But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
little O
we O
should O
spend O
would O
do O
any O
good O
. O
We O
've O
each O
got O
a O
dollar O
, O
and O
the O
army O
would O
n't O
be O
much O
helped O
by O
our O
giving O
that O
. O
I O
agree O
not O
to O
expect O
anything O
from O
Mother B-PER
or O
you O
, O
but O
I O
do O
want O
to O
buy O
_ O
Undine O
and O
Sintran O
_ O
for O
myself O
. O
I O
've O
wanted O
it O
so O
long O
, O
" O
said O
Jo B-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
was I-PER
a I-PER
bookworm I-PER
. O
" O
I O
planned O
to O
spend O
mine O
in O
new O
music O
, O
" O
said O
Beth B-PER
, O
with O
a O
little O
sigh O
, O
which O
no B-PER
one I-PER
heard O
but O
the O
hearth O
brush O
and O
kettle-holder O
. O
" O
I O
shall O
get O
a O
nice O
box O
of O
Faber O
's O
drawing O
pencils O
; O
I O
really O
need O
them O
, O
" O
said O
Amy B-PER
decidedly O
. O
" O
Mother B-PER
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
about O
our O
money O
, O
and O
she O
wo O
n't O
wish O
us O
to O
give O
up O
everything O
. O
Let O
's O
each O
buy O
what O
we O
want O
, O
and O
have O
a O
little O
fun O
; O
I O
'm O
sure O
we O
work O
hard O
enough O
to O
earn O
it O
, O
" O
cried O
Jo B-PER
, O
examining O
the O
heels O
of O
her O
shoes O
in O
a O
gentlemanly O
manner O
. O
" O
I O
know O
I O
do O
-- O
teaching O
those B-PER
tiresome I-PER
children I-PER
nearly O
all O
day O
, O
when O
I O
'm O
longing O
to O
enjoy O
myself O
at O
home B-FAC
, O
" O
began O
Meg B-PER
, O
in O
the O
complaining O
tone O
again O
. O
" O
You O
do O
n't O
have O
half O
such O
a O
hard O
time O
as O
I O
do O
, O
" O
said O
Jo B-PER
. O
" O
How O
would O
you O
like O
to O
be O
shut O
up O
for O
hours O
with O
a B-PER
nervous I-PER
, I-PER
fussy I-PER
old I-PER
lady I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
keeps I-PER
you I-PER
trotting I-PER
, I-PER
is I-PER
never I-PER
satisfied I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
worries I-PER
you I-PER
till I-PER
you I-PER
're I-PER
ready I-PER
to I-PER
fly I-PER
out I-PER
the I-PER
window I-PER
or I-PER
cry I-PER
? O
" O
" O
It O
's O
naughty O
to O
fret O
, O
but O
I O
do O
think O
washing O
dishes O
and O
keeping O
things O
tidy O
is O
the O
worst O
work O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
It O
makes O
me O
cross O
, O
and O
my O
hands O
get O
so O
stiff O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
practice O
well O
at O
all O
. O
" O
And O
Beth B-PER
looked O
at O
her O
rough O
hands O
with O
a O
sigh O
that O
any B-PER
one I-PER
could O
hear O
that O
time O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
any O
of O
you O
suffer O
as O
I O
do O
, O
" O
cried O
Amy B-PER
, O
" O
for O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
to O
school B-FAC
with O
impertinent O
girls O
, O
who O
plague O
you O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
your O
lessons O
, O
and O
laugh O
at O
your O
dresses O
, O
and O
label O
your B-PER
father I-PER
if O
he O
is O
n't O
rich O
, O
and O
insult O
you O
when O
your O
nose O
is O
n't O
nice O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
mean O
libel O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
so O
, O
and O
not O
talk O
about O
labels O
, O
as O
if O
Papa B-PER
was O
a O
pickle O
bottle O
, O
" O
advised O
Jo B-PER
, O
laughing O
. O
" O
I O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
, O
and O
you O
need O
n't O
be O
statirical O
about O
it O
. O
It O
's O
proper O
to O
use O
good O
words O
, O
and O
improve O
your O
vocabilary O
, O
" O
returned O
Amy B-PER
, O
with O
dignity O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
peck O
at O
one B-PER
another I-PER
, O
children B-PER
. O
Do O
n't O
you O
wish O
we O
had O
the O
money O
Papa B-PER
lost O
when O
we O
were O
little O
, O
Jo B-PER
? O
Dear B-PER
me O
! O
How O
happy O
and O
good O
we O
'd O
be O
, O
if O
we O
had O
no O
worries O
! O
" O
said O
Meg B-PER
, O
who O
could O
remember O
better O
times O
. O
" O
You O
said O
the O
other O
day O
you O
thought O
we O
were O
a O
deal O
happier O
than O
the B-PER
King I-PER
children I-PER
, O
for O
they O
were O
fighting O
and O
fretting O
all O
the O
time O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
money O
. O
" O
" O
So O
I O
did O
, O
Beth B-PER
. O
Well O
, O
I O
think O
we O
are O
. O
For O
though O
we O
do O
have O
to O
work O
, O
we O
make O
fun O
of O
ourselves O
, O
and O
are O
a B-PER
pretty I-PER
jolly I-PER
set I-PER
, O
as O
Jo B-PER
would O
say O
. O
" O
" O
Jo B-PER
does O
use O
such O
slang O
words O
! O
" O
observed O
Amy B-PER
, O
with O
a O
reproving O
look O
at O
the B-PER
long I-PER
figure I-PER
stretched I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
rug I-PER
. O
Jo B-PER
immediately O
sat O
up O
, O
put O
her O
hands O
in O
her O
pockets O
, O
and O
began O
to O
whistle O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
, O
Jo B-PER
. O
It O
's O
so O
boyish O
! O
" O
" O
That O
's O
why O
I O
do O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
detest O
rude B-PER
, I-PER
unladylike I-PER
girls I-PER
! O
" O
" O
I O
hate O
affected B-PER
, I-PER
niminy-piminy I-PER
chits I-PER
! O
" O
" O
Birds O
in O
their O
little O
nests O
agree O
, O
" O
sang O
Beth B-PER
, O
the B-PER
peacemaker I-PER
, O
with O
such O
a O
funny O
face O
that O
both O
sharp O
voices O
softened O
to O
a O
laugh O
, O
and O
the O
" O
pecking O
" O
ended O
for O
that O
time O
. O
" O
Really O
, O
girls B-PER
, O
you O
are O
both O
to O
be O
blamed O
, O
" O
said O
Meg B-PER
, O
beginning O
to O
lecture O
in O
her O
elder-sisterly O
fashion O
. O
" O
You O
are O
old O
enough O
to O
leave O
off O
boyish O
tricks O
, O
and O
to O
behave O
better O
, O
Josephine B-PER
. O
It O
did O
n't O
matter O
so O
much O
when O
you O
were O
a B-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
, O
but O
now O
you O
are O
so O
tall O
, O
and O
turn O
up O
your O
hair O
, O
you O
should O
remember O
that O
you O
are O
a B-PER
young I-PER
lady I-PER
. O
" O
" O
I O
'm O
not O
! O
And O
if O
turning O
up O
my O
hair O
makes O
me O
one O
, O
I O
'll O
wear O
it O
in O
two O
tails O
till O
I O
'm O
twenty O
, O
" O
cried O
Jo B-PER
, O
pulling O
off O
her O
net O
, O
and O
shaking O
down O
a O
chestnut O
mane O
. O
" O
I O
hate O
to O
think O
I O
've O
got O
to O
grow O
up O
, O
and O
be O
Miss B-PER
March O
, O
and O
wear O
long O
gowns O
, O
and O
look O
as O
prim O
as O
a O
China O
Aster O
! O
It O
's O
bad O
enough O
to O
be O
a B-PER
girl I-PER
, O
anyway O
, O
when O
I O
like O
boy B-PER
's O
games O
and O
work O
and O
manners O
! O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
over O
my O
disappointment O
in O
not O
being O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
. O
And O
it O
's O
worse O
than O
ever O
now O
, O
for O
I O
'm O
dying O
to O
go O
and O
fight O
with O
Papa B-PER
. O
And O
I O
can O
only O
stay O
home B-FAC
and O
knit O
, O
like O
a B-PER
poky I-PER
old I-PER
woman I-PER
! O
" O
And O
Jo B-PER
shook O
the O
blue O
army O
sock O
till O
the O
needles O
rattled O
like O
castanets O
, O
and O
her O
ball O
bounded O
across O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
" O
Poor B-PER
Jo I-PER
! O
It O
's O
too O
bad O
, O
but O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
helped O
. O
So O
you O
must O
try O
to O
be O
contented O
with O
making O
your O
name O
boyish O
, O
and O
playing O
brother B-PER
to O
us B-PER
girls I-PER
, O
" O
said O
Beth B-PER
, O
stroking O
the O
rough O
head O
with O
a O
hand O
that O
all O
the O
dish O
washing O
and O
dusting O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
could O
not O
make O
ungentle O
in O
its O
touch O
. O
" O
As O
for O
you O
, O
Amy B-PER
, O
" O
continued O
Meg B-PER
, O
" O
you O
are O
altogether O
too O
particular O
and O
prim O

Your O
airs O
are O
funny O
now O

but O
you O
'll O
grow O
up O
an B-PER
affected I-PER
little I-PER
goose I-PER

if O
you O
do O

take O
care O

I O
like O
your O
nice O

refined O
ways O
of O
speaking O
, O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
try O
to O
be O
elegant O

But O
your O
absurd O
words O
are O
as O
bad O
as O
Jo B-PER

slang O

" O
" O
If O
Jo B-PER

a B-PER
tomboy I-PER

Amy B-PER
a B-PER
goose I-PER

what O
am O
I O
, O
please O
? O
" O
asked O
Beth B-PER
, O
ready O
to O
share O
the O
lecture O

" O
You O
're O
a B-PER
dear I-PER

and O
nothing O
else O
, O
" O
answered O
Meg B-PER
warmly O
, O
and O
no B-PER
one I-PER
contradicted O
her O
, O
for O
the B-PER
' I-PER
Mouse I-PER
' I-PER
was O
the B-PER
pet I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
family I-PER

As O
young B-PER
readers I-PER
like O
to O
know O
' O
how O
people B-PER
look O
' O
, O
we O
will O
take O
this O
moment O
to O
give O
them O
a O
little O
sketch O
of O
the B-PER
four I-PER
sisters I-PER
, O
who O
sat O
knitting O
away O
in O
the O
twilight O
, O
while O
the O
December O
snow O
fell O
quietly O
without O
, O
and O
the O
fire O
crackled O
cheerfully O
within O
. O
It O
was O
a B-FAC
comfortable I-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
though O
the O
carpet O
was O
faded O
and O
the O
furniture O
very O
plain O
, O
for O
a O
good O
picture O
or O
two O
hung O
on O
the O
walls O
, O
books O
filled O
the O
recesses O
, O
chrysanthemums O
and O
Christmas O
roses O
bloomed O
in O
the O
windows O
, O
and O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere O
of O
home B-FAC
peace O
pervaded O
it O
. O
Margaret B-PER
, O
the O
eldest O
of O
the B-PER
four I-PER
, O
was O
sixteen O
, O
and O
very O
pretty O
, O
being O
plump O
and O
fair O
, O
with O
large O
eyes O
, O
plenty O
of O
soft O
brown O
hair O
, O
a O
sweet O
mouth O
, O
and O
white O
hands O
, O
of O
which O
she O
was O
rather O
vain O
. O
Fifteen-year-old B-PER
Jo I-PER
was O
very O
tall O
, O
thin O
, O
and O
brown O
, O
and O
reminded O
one O
of O
a O
colt O
, O
for O
she O
never O
seemed O
to O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
her O
long O
limbs O
, O
which O
were O
very O
much O
in O
her O
way O
. O
She O
had O
a O
decided O
mouth O
, O
a O
comical O
nose O
, O
and O
sharp O
, O
gray O
eyes O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
see O
everything O
, O
and O
were O
by O
turns O
fierce O
, O
funny O
, O
or O
thoughtful O
. O
Her O
long O
, O
thick O
hair O
was O
her O
one O
beauty O
, O
but O
it O
was O
usually O
bundled O
into O
a O
net O
, O
to O
be O
out O
of O
her O
way O
. O
Round O
shoulders O
had O
Jo B-PER
, O
big O
hands O
and O
feet O
, O
a O
flyaway O
look O
to O
her O
clothes O
, O
and O
the O
uncomfortable O
appearance O
of O
a O
girl O
who O
was O
rapidly O
shooting O
up O
into O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
and O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
. O
Elizabeth B-PER
, O
or O
Beth B-PER

as O
everyone B-PER
called O
her O
, O
was O
a B-PER
rosy I-PER

smooth-haired I-PER

bright-eyed I-PER
girl I-PER
of I-PER
thirteen I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
shy I-PER
manner I-PER
, I-PER
a I-PER
timid I-PER
voice I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
a I-PER
peaceful I-PER
expression I-PER
which I-PER
was I-PER
seldom I-PER
disturbed I-PER
. O
Her B-PER
father I-PER
called O
her O
' O
Little B-PER
Miss I-PER
Tranquility I-PER
' O
, O
and O
the O
name O
suited O
her O
excellently O
, O
for O
she O
seemed O
to O
live O
in O
a O
happy O
world O
of O
her O
own O
, O
only O
venturing O
out O
to O
meet O
the B-PER
few I-PER
whom I-PER
she I-PER
trusted I-PER

loved I-PER

Amy B-PER

the B-PER

half O

The B-FAC

wound O

At O

bid O
fair O
to O
follow O
in O
the O
way O

his B-PER
father I-PER

He O
was O
not O
so O
large O

-- O
he O
weighed O
only O
one O
hundred O

forty O
pounds O

-- O
for O
his B-PER
mother I-PER

Shep B-PER

been O
a B-PER
Scotch I-PER
shepherd I-PER
dog I-PER

Nevertheless O
, O
one O
hundred O

forty O

, O
to O
which O
was O
added O
the O
dignity O
that O
comes O
of O
good O
living O
and O
universal O
respect O
, O
enabled O
him O
to O
carry O
himself O
in O
right O
royal O
fashion O
. O
During O
the O
four O
years O
since O
his O
puppyhood O
he O
had O
lived O
the O
life O
of O
a B-PER
sated I-PER
aristocrat I-PER
; O
he O
had O
a O
fine O
pride O
in O
himself O
, O
was O
even O
a O
trifle O
egotistical O
, O
as O
country B-PER
gentlemen I-PER
sometimes O
become O
because O
of O
their O
insular O
situation O
. O
But O
he O
had O
saved O
himself O
by O
not O
becoming O
a O
mere O
pampered O
house-dog O
. O
Hunting O
and O
kindred O
outdoor O
delights O
had O
kept O
down O
the O
fat O
and O
hardened O
his O
muscles O
; O
and O
to O
him O
, O
as O
to O
the O
cold-tubbing O
races O
, O
the O
love O
of O
water O
had O
been O
a O
tonic O
and O
a O
health O
preserver O
. O
And O
this O
was O
the O
manner O
of O
dog O
Buck B-PER
was O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1897 O
, O
when O
the O
Klondike O
strike O
dragged O
men O
from O
all O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
into O
the B-LOC
frozen I-LOC
North I-LOC
. O
But O
Buck B-PER
did O
not O
read O
the O
newspapers O
, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
know O
that O
Manuel B-PER
, O
one O
of O
the B-PER
gardener I-PER
's O
helpers O
, O
was O
an B-PER
undesirable I-PER
acquaintance I-PER
. O
Manuel B-PER
had O
one O
besetting O
sin O
. O
He O
loved O
to O
play O
Chinese O
lottery O
. O
Also O
, O
in O
his O
gambling O
, O
he O
had O
one O
besetting O
weakness O
-- O
faith O
in O
a O
system O
; O
and O
this O
made O
his O
damnation O
certain O
. O
For O
to O
play O
a O
system O
requires O
money O
, O
while O
the O
wages O
of O
a B-PER
gardener I-PER
's O
helper O
do O
not O
lap O
over O
the O
needs O
of O
a B-PER
wife I-PER
and O
numerous O
progeny B-PER
. O
The B-PER
Judge I-PER
was O
at O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
Raisin O
Growers O
' O
Association O
, O
and O
the B-PER
boys I-PER
were O
busy O
organizing O
an O
athletic O
club O
, O
on O
the O
memorable O
night O
of O
Manuel B-PER
's O
treachery O
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
saw O
him O
and O
Buck B-PER
go O
off O
through O
the B-FAC
orchard I-FAC
on O
what O
Buck B-PER
imagined O
was O
merely O
a O
stroll O
. O
And O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
solitary O
man B-PER
, O
no B-PER
one I-PER
saw O
them O
arrive O
at O
the B-FAC
little I-FAC
flag I-FAC
station I-FAC
known O
as O
College B-FAC
Park I-FAC
. O
This B-PER
man I-PER
talked O
with O
Manuel B-PER
, O
and O
money O
chinked O
between O
them O
. O
“ O
You O
might O
wrap O
up O
the O
goods O
before O
you O
deliver O
'm O
, O
” O
the B-PER
stranger I-PER
said O
gruffly O
, O
and O
Manuel B-PER
doubled O
a O
piece O
of O
stout O
rope O
around O
Buck B-PER
's O
neck O
under O
the O
collar O
. O
“ O
Twist O
it O
, O
an O
' O
you O
'll O
choke O
'm O
plentee O
, O
” O
said O
Manuel B-PER
, O
and O
the B-PER
stranger I-PER
grunted O
a O
ready O
affirmative O
. O
Buck B-PER
had O
accepted O
the O
rope O
with O
quiet O
dignity O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
was O
an O
unwonted O
performance O
: O
but O
he O
had O
learned O
to O
trust O
in O
men B-PER
he O
knew O
, O
and O
to O
give O
them O
credit O
for O
a O
wisdom O
that O
outreached O
his O
own O
. O
But O
when O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
rope O
were O
placed O
in O
the B-PER
stranger I-PER
's O
hands O
, O
he O
growled O
menacingly O
. O
He O
had O
merely O
intimated O
his O
displeasure O
, O
in O
his O
pride O
believing O
that O
to O
intimate O
was O
to O
command O
. O
But O
to O
his O
surprise O
the O
rope O
tightened O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
shutting O
off O
his O
breath O
. O
In O
quick O
rage O
he O
sprang O
at O
the B-PER
man I-PER
, O
who O
met O
him O
halfway O
, O
grappled O
him O
close O
by O
the O
throat O
, O
and O
with O
a O
deft O
twist O
threw O
him O
over O
on O
his O
back O
. O
Then O
the O
rope O
tightened O
mercilessly O
, O
while O
Buck B-PER
struggled O
in O
a O
fury O
, O
his O
tongue O
lolling O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
his O
great O
chest O
panting O
futilely O
. O
Never O
in O
all O
his O
life O
had O
he O
been O
so O
vilely O
treated O
, O
and O
never O
in O
all O
his O
life O
had O
he O
been O
so O
angry O
. O
But O
his O
strength O
ebbed O
, O
his O
eyes O
glazed O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
nothing O
when O
the O
train O
was O
flagged O
and O
the B-PER
two I-PER
men I-PER
threw O
him O
into O
the B-FAC
baggage I-FAC
car I-FAC
. O
The O
next O
he O
knew O
, O
he O
was O
dimly O
aware O
that O
his O
tongue O
was O
hurting O
and O
that O
he O
was O
being O
jolted O
along O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
a B-FAC
conveyance I-FAC
. O
The O
hoarse O
shriek O
of O
a O
locomotive O
whistling O
a O
crossing O
told O
him O
where B-FAC
he I-FAC
was I-FAC
. O
He O
had O
travelled O
too O
often O
with O
the B-PER
Judge I-PER
not O
to O
know O
the O
sensation O
of O
riding O
in O
a B-VEH
baggage I-VEH
car I-VEH
. O
He O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
into O
them O
came O
the O
unbridled O
anger O
of O
a B-PER
kidnapped I-PER
king I-PER
. O
The B-PER
man I-PER
sprang O
for O
his O
throat O
, O
but O
Buck B-PER
was O
too O
quick O
for O
him O
. O
His O
jaws O
closed O
on O
the O
hand O
, O
nor O
did O
they O
relax O
till O
his O
senses O
were O
choked O
out O
of O
him O
once O
more O
. O
“ O
Yep O
, O
has O
fits O
, O
” O
the B-PER
man I-PER
said O
, O
hiding O
his O
mangled O
hand O
from O
the B-PER
baggageman I-PER
, O
who O
had O
been O
attracted O
by O
the O
sounds O
of O
struggle O
. O
“ O
I O
'm O
takin O
' O

up O
for O
the B-PER
boss I-PER
to O

A B-PER

dog-doctor I-PER
there B-GPE
thinks O
that O
he O
can O
cure O

. O
” O
Concerning O
that O
night O
's O
ride O
, O
the B-PER
man I-PER
spoke O
most O
eloquently O
for O
himself O
, O
in O
a B-FAC
little I-FAC
shed I-FAC
back O
of O
a B-FAC
saloon I-FAC
on O
the O
San B-GPE
Francisco I-GPE
water B-FAC
front I-FAC
. O
“ O
All O
I O
get O
is O
fifty O
for O
it O
, O
” O
he O
grumbled O
; O
“ O
an O
' O
I O
would O
n't O
do O
it O
over O
for O
a O
thousand O
, O
cold O
cash O
. O
” O
His O
hand O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a O
bloody O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
the O
right O
trouser O
leg O
was O
ripped O
from O
knee O
to O
ankle O
. O
“ O
How O
much O
did O
the B-PER
other I-PER
mug I-PER
get O
? O
” O
the B-PER
saloon-keeper I-PER
demanded O
. O
“ O
A O
hundred O
, O
” O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
“ O
Would O
n't O
take O
a O
sou O
less O
, O
so O
help O
me O
. O
” O
“ O
That O
makes O
a O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
, O
” O
the B-PER
saloon-keeper I-PER
calculated O
; O
“ O
and O
he O
's O
worth O
it O
, O
or O
I O
'm O
a B-PER
squarehead I-PER
. O
” O
The B-PER
kidnapper I-PER
undid O
the O
bloody O
wrappings O
and O
looked O
at O
his O
lacerated O
hand O
. O
“ O
If O
I O
do O

get O
the O
hydrophoby O
-- O
” O
“ O
It O
'll O
be O
because O
you O
was O
born O
to O

” O
laughed O
the B-PER
saloon-keeper I-PER
. O
“ O
Here O
, O
lend O
me O
a O
hand O
before O
you O
pull O
your O

, O
” O
he O
added O
. O
Dazed O
, O
suffering O
intolerable O
pain O
from O
throat O
and O
tongue O
, O
with O
the O
life O
half O
throttled O
out O
of O
him O
, O
Buck B-PER
attempted O
to O
face O
his B-PER
tormentors I-PER

But O
he O
was O
thrown O
down O
and O
choked O
repeatedly O
, O
till O
they O
succeeded O
in O
filing O
the O
heavy O
brass O
collar O
from O
off O
his O
neck O
. O
Then O
the O
rope O
was O
removed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
flung O
into O
a B-FAC
cagelike I-FAC
crate I-FAC
. O
There B-FAC
he O
lay O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
weary O
night O
, O
nursing O
his O
wrath O
and O
wounded O
pride O
. O
He O
could O
not O
understand O
what O
it O
all O
meant O
. O
What O
did O
they O
want O
with O
him O
, O
these B-PER
strange I-PER
men I-PER
? O
Why O
were O
they O
keeping O
him O
pent O
up O
in O
this B-FAC
narrow I-FAC
crate I-FAC
? O
He O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
oppressed O
by O
the O
vague O
sense O
of O
impending O
calamity O
. O
Several O
times O
during O
the O
night O
he O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
when O
the O
shed O
door O
rattled O
open O
, O
expecting O
to O
see O
the O
Judge B-PER
, O
or O
the O
boys B-PER
at O
least O
. O
But O
each O
time O
it O
was O
the O
bulging O
face O
of O
the B-PER
saloon-keeper I-PER
that O
peered O
in O
at O
him O
by O
the O
sickly O
light O
of O
a O
tallow O
candle O
. O
And O
each O
time O
the O
joyful O
bark O
that O
trembled O
in O
Buck B-PER
's O
throat O
was O
twisted O
into O
a O
savage O
growl O
. O
But O
the B-PER
saloon-keeper I-PER
let O
him O
alone O
, O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
four O
men B-PER
entered O
and O
picked O
up O
the O
crate O
. O
More O
tormentors B-PER
, O
Buck B-PER
decided O
, O
for O
they O
were O
evil-looking B-PER
creatures I-PER
, O
ragged O
and O
unkempt O
; O
and O
he O
stormed O
and O
raged O
at O
them O
through O
the O
bars O
. O
They O
only O
laughed O
and O
poked O
sticks O
at O
him O
, O
which O
he O
promptly O
assailed O
with O
his O
teeth O
till O
he O
realized O
that O
that O
was O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O
Whereupon O
he O
lay O
down O
sullenly O
and O
allowed O
the B-FAC
crate I-FAC
to O
be O
lifted O
into O
a B-FAC
wagon I-FAC
. O
Then O
he O
, O
and O
the B-FAC
crate I-FAC
in O
which O
he O
was O
imprisoned O
, O
began O
a O
passage O
through O
many O
hands O
. O
Clerks B-PER
in O
the B-FAC
express I-FAC
office I-FAC
took O
charge O
of O
him O
; O
he O
was O
carted O
about O
in O
another B-FAC
wagon I-FAC
; O
a B-FAC
truck I-FAC
carried O
him O
, O
with O
an O
assortment O
of O
boxes O
and O
parcels O
, O
upon O
a B-FAC
ferry I-FAC
steamer I-FAC
; O
he O
was O
trucked O
off O
the B-FAC
steamer I-FAC
into O
a B-FAC
great I-FAC
railway I-FAC
depot I-FAC
, O
and O
finally O
he O
was O
deposited O
in O
an B-VEH
express I-VEH
car I-VEH

CONTAINING O

MUCH O
OF O
THE O
BIRTH O
OF O
THE B-PER
FOUNDLING I-PER
AS O
IS O
NECESSARY O
OR O
PROPER O
TO O
ACQUAINT O
THE B-PER
READER I-PER
WITH O
IN O
THE O
BEGINNING O
OF O
THIS O
HISTORY O

The O
introduction O
to O
the O
work O
, O
or O
bill O
of O
fare O
to O
the O
feast O
. O
An B-PER
author I-PER
ought O
to O
consider O
himself O
, O
not O
as O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
who I-PER
gives I-PER
a I-PER
private I-PER
or I-PER
eleemosynary I-PER
treat I-PER
, O
but O
rather O
as O
one B-PER
who I-PER
keeps I-PER
a I-PER
public I-PER
ordinary I-PER
, O
at O
which O
all B-PER
persons I-PER
are O
welcome O
for O
their O
money O
. O
In O
the O
former O
case O
, O
it O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the B-PER
entertainer I-PER
provides O
what O
fare O
he O
pleases O
; O
and O
though O
this O
should O
be O
very O
indifferent O
, O
and O
utterly O
disagreeable O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
his B-PER
company I-PER
, O
they O
must O
not O
find O
any O
fault O
; O
nay O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
good O
breeding O
forces O
them O
outwardly O
to O
approve O
and O
to O
commend O
whatever O
is O
set O
before O
them O
. O
Now O
the O
contrary O
of O
this O
happens O
to O
the B-PER
master I-PER
of I-PER
an I-PER
ordinary I-PER
. O
Men B-PER
who I-PER
pay I-PER
for I-PER
what I-PER
they I-PER
eat I-PER
will O
insist O
on O
gratifying O
their O
palates O
, O
however O
nice O
and O
whimsical O
these O
may O
prove O
; O
and O
if O
everything O
is O
not O
agreeable O
to O
their O
taste O
, O
will O
challenge O
a O
right O
to O
censure O
, O
to O
abuse O
, O
and O
to O
d O
-- O
n O
their O
dinner O
without O
controul O
. O
To O
prevent O
, O
therefore O
, O
giving O
offence O
to O
their B-PER
customers I-PER
by O
any O
such O
disappointment O
, O
it O
hath O
been O
usual O
with O
the B-PER
honest I-PER
and I-PER
well-meaning I-PER
host I-PER
to O
provide O
a O
bill O
of O
fare O
which O
all B-PER
persons I-PER
may O
peruse O
at O
their O
first O
entrance O
into O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
; O
and O
having O
thence O
acquainted O
themselves O
with O
the O
entertainment O
which O
they O
may O
expect O
, O
may O
either O
stay O
and O
regale O
with O
what O
is O
provided O
for O
them O
, O
or O
may O
depart O
to O
some O
other O
ordinary O
better O
accommodated O
to O
their O
taste O
. O
As O
we O
do O
not O
disdain O
to O
borrow O
wit O
or O
wisdom O
from O
any B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
is I-PER
capable I-PER
of I-PER
lending I-PER
us I-PER
either I-PER
, O
we O
have O
condescended O
to O
take O
a O
hint O
from O
these B-PER
honest I-PER
victuallers I-PER
, O
and O
shall O
prefix O
not O
only O
a O
general O
bill O
of O
fare O
to O
our O
whole O
entertainment O
, O
but O
shall O
likewise O
give O
the B-PER
reader I-PER
particular O
bills O
to O
every O
course O
which O
is O
to O
be O
served O
up O
in O
this O
and O
the O
ensuing O
volumes O
. O
The O
provision O
, O
then O
, O
which O
we O
have O
here O
made O
is O
no O
other O
than O
_ O
Human O
Nature O
_ O
. O
Nor O
do O
I O
fear O
that O
my B-PER
sensible I-PER
reader I-PER
, O
though O
most O
luxurious O
in O
his O
taste O
, O
will O
start O
, O
cavil O
, O
or O
be O
offended O
, O
because O
I O
have O
named O
but O
one O
article O
. O
The O
tortoise O
-- O
as O
the O
alderman O
of O
Bristol B-GPE
, O
well O
learned O
in O
eating O
, O
knows O
by O
much O
experience O
-- O
besides O
the O
delicious O
calipash O
and O
calipee O
, O
contains O
many O
different O
kinds O
of O
food O
; O
nor O
can O
the B-PER
learned I-PER
reader I-PER
be O
ignorant O
, O
that O
in O
human O
nature O
, O
though O
here O
collected O
under O
one O
general O
name O
, O
is O
such O
prodigious O
variety O
, O
that O
a B-PER
cook I-PER
will O
have O
sooner O
gone O
through O
all O
the O
several O
species O
of O
animal O
and O
vegetable O
food O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
than O
an B-PER
author I-PER
will O
be O
able O
to O
exhaust O
so O
extensive O
a O
subject O
. O
An O
objection O
may O
perhaps O
be O
apprehended O
from O
the O
more O
delicate O
, O
that O
this O
dish O
is O
too O
common O
and O
vulgar O
; O
for O
what O
else O
is O
the O
subject O
of O
all O
the O
romances O
, O
novels O
, O
plays O
, O
and O
poems O
, O
with O
which O
the O
stalls O
abound O
? O
Many O
exquisite O
viands O
might O
be O
rejected O
by O
the B-PER
epicure I-PER
, O
if O
it O
was O
a O
sufficient O
cause O
for O
his O
contemning O
of O
them O
as O
common O
and O
vulgar O
, O
that O
something O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the B-FAC
most I-FAC
paltry I-FAC
alleys I-FAC
under I-FAC
the I-FAC
same I-FAC
name I-FAC
. O
In O
reality O
, O
true O
nature O
is O
as O
difficult O
to O
be O
met O
with O
in O
authors B-PER
, O
as O
the O
Bayonne O
ham O
, O
or O
Bologna O
sausage O
, O
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the B-FAC
shops I-FAC
. O
But O
the O
whole O
, O
to O
continue O
the O
same O
metaphor O
, O
consists O
in O
the O
cookery O
of O
the B-PER
author I-PER
; O
for O
, O
as O
Mr B-PER
Pope O
tells O
us O
-- O
“ O
True O
wit O
is O
nature O
to O
advantage O
drest O
; O
What O
oft O
was O
thought O
, O
but O
ne'er O
so O
well O
exprest O
. O
” O
The O
same O
animal O
which O
hath O
the O
honour O
to O
have O
some O
part O
of O
his O
flesh O
eaten O
at O
the O
table O
of O
a B-PER
duke I-PER
, O
may O
perhaps O
be O
degraded O
in O
another O
part O
, O
and O
some O
of O
his O
limbs O
gibbeted O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
in O
the O
vilest O
stall O
in O
town B-GPE
. O
Where O
, O
then O
, O
lies O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
food O
of O
the B-PER
nobleman I-PER
and O
the B-PER
porter I-PER
, O
if O
both O
are O
at O
dinner O
on O
the O
same O
ox O
or O
calf O
, O
but O
in O
the O
seasoning O
, O
the O
dressing O
, O
the O
garnishing O
, O
and O
the O
setting O
forth O
? O
Hence O
the O
one O
provokes O
and O
incites O
the O
most O
languid O
appetite O
, O
and O
the O
other O
turns O
and O
palls O
that O
which O
is O
the O
sharpest O
and O
keenest O
. O
In O
like O
manner O
, O
the O
excellence O
of O
the O
mental O
entertainment O
consists O
less O
in O
the O
subject O
than O
in O
the B-PER
author I-PER
's O
skill O
in O
well O
dressing O
it O
up O
. O
How O
pleased O
, O
therefore O
, O
will O
the B-PER
reader I-PER
be O
to O
find O
that O
we O
have O
, O
in O
the O
following O
work O
, O
adhered O
closely O
to O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
principles O
of O
the O
best O
cook O
which O
the O
present O
age O
, O
or O
perhaps O
that O
of O
Heliogabalus B-PER
, O
hath O
produced O
. O
This B-PER
great I-PER
man I-PER
, O
as O
is O
well O
known O
to O
all B-PER
lovers I-PER
of I-PER
polite I-PER
eating I-PER
, O
begins O
at O
first O
by O
setting O
plain O
things O
before O
his B-PER
hungry I-PER
guests I-PER
, O
rising O
afterwards O
by O
degrees O
as O
their O
stomachs O
may O
be O
supposed O
to O
decrease O
, O
to O
the O
very O
quintessence O
of O
sauce O
and O
spices O
. O
In O
like O
manner O
, O
we O
shall O
represent O
human O
nature O
at O
first O
to O
the O
keen O
appetite O
of O
our B-PER
reader I-PER
, O
in O
that O
more O
plain O
and O
simple O
manner O
in O
which O
it O
is O
found O
in O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
and O
shall O
hereafter O
hash O
and O
ragoo O
it O
with O
all O
the O
high O
French O
and O
Italian O
seasoning O
of O
affectation O
and O
vice O
which O
courts B-FAC
and O
cities B-FAC
afford O
. O
By O
these O
means O
, O
we O
doubt O
not O
but O
our B-PER
reader I-PER
may O
be O
rendered O
desirous O
to O
read O
on O
for O
ever O
, O
as O
the B-PER
great I-PER
person I-PER
just I-PER
above-mentioned I-PER
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
made O
some B-PER
persons I-PER
eat O
. O
Having O
premised O
thus O
much O
, O
we O
will O
now O
detain O
those B-PER
who I-PER
like I-PER
our I-PER
bill I-PER
of I-PER
fare I-PER
no O
longer O
from O
their O
diet O
, O
and O
shall O
proceed O
directly O
to O
serve O
up O
the O
first O
course O
of O
our O
history O
for O
their O
entertainment O

Chapter O
ii O
. O
A O
short O
description O
of O
squire B-PER
Allworthy O
, O
and O
a O
fuller O
account O
of O
Miss B-PER
Bridget O
Allworthy O
, O
his B-PER
sister I-PER
. O
In O
that O
part O
of O
the O
western O
division O
of O
this B-GPE
kingdom I-GPE
which O
is O
commonly O
called O
Somersetshire B-GPE
, O
there O
lately O
lived O
, O
and O
perhaps O
lives O
still O
, O
a O
gentleman B-PER
whose O
name O
was O
Allworthy B-PER
, O
and O
who O
might O
well O
be O
called O
the B-PER
favourite I-PER
of I-PER
both I-PER
nature I-PER
and I-PER
fortune I-PER
; O
for O
both O
of O
these O
seem O
to O
have O
contended O
which O
should O
bless O
and O
enrich O
him O
most O
. O
In O
this O
contention O
, O
nature O
may O
seem O
to O
some O
to O
have O
come O
off O
victorious O
, O
as O
she O
bestowed O
on O
him O
many O
gifts O
, O
while O
fortune O
had O
only O
one O
gift O
in O
her O
power O
; O
but O
in O
pouring O
forth O
this O
, O
she O
was O
so O
very O
profuse O
, O
that O
others O
perhaps O
may O
think O
this O
single O
endowment O
to O
have O
been O
more O
than O
equivalent O
to O
all O
the O
various O
blessings O
which O
he O
enjoyed O
from O
nature O
. O
From O
the O
former O
of O
these O
, O
he O
derived O
an O
agreeable O
person O
, O
a O
sound O
constitution O
, O
a O
solid O
understanding O
, O
and O
a O
benevolent O
heart O
; O
by O
the O
latter O
, O
he O
was O
decreed O
to O
the O
inheritance O
of O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
estates O
in O
the B-GPE
county I-GPE
. O
This B-PER
gentleman I-PER
had O
in O
his B-PER
youth I-PER
married O
a B-PER
very I-PER
worthy I-PER
and I-PER
beautiful I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
of O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
extremely O
fond O
: O
by O
her O
he O
had O
three B-PER
children I-PER
, O
all O
of O
whom O
died O
in O
their O
infancy O
. O
He O
had O
likewise O
had O
the O
misfortune O
of O
burying O
this B-PER
beloved I-PER
wife I-PER
herself O
, O
about O
five O
years O
before O
the O
time O
in O
which O
this O
history O
chuses O
to O
set O
out O
. O
This O
loss O
, O
however O
great O
, O
he O
bore O
like O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
sense I-PER
and I-PER
constancy I-PER
, O
though O
it O
must O
be O
confest O
he O
would O
often O
talk O
a O
little O
whimsically O
on O
this O
head O
; O
for O
he O
sometimes O
said O
he O
looked O
on O
himself O
as O
still O
married O
, O
and O
considered O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
as O
only O
gone O
a O
little O
before O
him O
, O
a O
journey O
which O
he O
should O
most O
certainly O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
, O
take O
after O
her O
; O
and O
that O
he O
had O
not O
the O
least O
doubt O
of O
meeting O
her O
again O
in O
a B-FAC
place I-FAC
where I-FAC
he I-FAC
should I-FAC
never I-FAC
part I-FAC
with I-FAC
her I-FAC
more I-FAC
-- O
sentiments O
for O
which O
his O
sense O
was O
arraigned O
by O
one O
part O
of O
his B-PER
neighbours I-PER
, O
his O
religion O
by O
a O
second O
, O
and O
his O
sincerity O
by O
a O
third O
. O
He O
now O
lived O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
retired O
in O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
with O
one B-PER
sister I-PER
, O
for O
whom O
he O
had O
a O
very O
tender O
affection O
. O
This B-PER
lady I-PER
was O
now O
somewhat O
past O
the O
age O
of O
thirty O
, O
an O
aera O
at O
which O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the B-PER
malicious I-PER
, O
the O
title O
of O
old B-PER
maid I-PER
may O
with O
no O
impropriety O
be O
assumed O
. O
She O
was O
of O
that O
species O
of O
women O
whom O
you O
commend O
rather O
for O
good O
qualities O
than O
beauty O
, O
and O
who O
are O
generally O
called O
, O
by O
their O
own O
sex O
, O
very B-PER
good I-PER
sort I-PER
of I-PER
women I-PER
-- O
as O
good O
a O
sort O
of O
woman B-PER
, O
madam B-PER
, O
as O
you O
would O
wish O
to O
know O
. O
Indeed O
, O
she O
was O
so O
far O
from O

( O
for O
that O

very O

, O
I O
have O
observed O
, O
though O
it O
may O
seem O
unaccountable O
to O
the B-PER

that O
this O
guard O
of O

like O

is O
always O
readiest O

go O

It O
often O
basely O

cowardly O
deserts O

spreading I-PER
every I-PER
net I-PER
in I-PER
their I-PER
power I-PER

and O
constantly O
attends O
at O
the O
heels O
of O
that B-PER
higher I-PER
order I-PER
of I-PER
women I-PER
for O
whom O
the B-PER
other I-PER

have O
a O
more O
distant O

awful O
respect O

whom O
( O
from O

I O
suppose O

of O

I O

Mr B-PER

at O
his O

The O

behaviour O
of O
Mrs B-PER
Deborah O

with O
some O
proper O
animadversions O
on O

I O
have O
told O
my B-PER
reader I-PER
, O
in O
the O
preceding O
chapter O
, O
that O
Mr B-PER
Allworthy O
inherited O
a O
large O
fortune O
; O
that O
he O
had O
a O
good O
heart O
, O
and O
no B-PER
family I-PER
. O
Hence O
, O
doubtless O
, O
it O
will O
be O
concluded O
by O
many O
that O
he O
lived O
like O
an B-PER
honest I-PER
man I-PER
, O
owed O
no B-PER
one I-PER
a O
shilling O
, O
took O
nothing O
but O
what O
was O
his O
own O
, O
kept O
a B-FAC
good I-FAC
house I-FAC
, O
entertained O
his B-PER
neighbours I-PER
with O
a O
hearty O
welcome O
at O
his O
table O
, O
and O
was O
charitable O
to O
the O
poor O
, O
i.e. O
to O
those O
who O
had O
rather O
beg O
than O
work O
, O
by O
giving O
them O
the O
offals O
from O
it O

that O
he O
died O
immensely O

But O
even O
as O
this B-PER
quaint I-PER
figure I-PER
vanished O
there O
sprang O
up O
a O
new O
and O
glittering O
one O
to O
take O
his O
place O
. O
He O
stood O
framed O
in O
the O
great O
plate-glass O
window O
of O
the O
very O
building O
which O
had O
brought O
about O
the O
defeat O
of O
his B-PER
predecessor I-PER
. O
A O
miracle O
of O
close O
shaving O
his O
face O
was O
, O
and O
a O
marvel O
of O
immaculateness O
his O
linen O
. O
Dapper O
he O
was O
, O
and O
dressy O
, O
albeit O
inclined O
to O
glittering O
effects O
and O
a O
certain O
plethory O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
neck O

Back O
of O
him O
stood O
shining O
shapes O
that O
reflected O
his O
glory O
in O
enamel O
, O
and O
brass O
, O
and O
glass O
. O
His O
language O
was O
floral O
, O
but O
choice O
; O
his O
talk O
was O
of O
gearings O
and O
bearings O
and O
cylinders O
and O
magnetos O
; O
his O
method O
differed O
from O
that O
of O
him O
who O
went O
before O
as O
the O
method O
of O

from O

of O
the O
man O

a O
barrel O

And O
as O
he O
multiplied O
and O
spread O
over O
the B-LOC
land I-LOC
we O
coined O
a O
new O
figure O
of O
speech O
. O
" O
Smooth O
! O
" O
we O
chuckled O
. O
" O
As O
smooth O
as O
an B-VEH
automobile I-VEH

" O
But O
even O
as O
we O
listened O
, O
fascinated O
by O
his O
fluent O
verbiage O
there O
grew O
within O
us O
a O
certain O
resentment O
. O
Familiarity O
with O
his B-VEH
glittering I-VEH
wares I-VEH
bred O
a O
contempt O
of O
them O
, O
so O
that O
he O
fell O
to O
speaking O
of O
them O
as O
necessities O
instead O
of O
luxuries O
. O
He O
juggled O
figures O
, O
and O
thought O
nothing O
of O
four O
of O
them O
in O
a O
row O
. O
We O
looked O
at O
our O
five-thousand-dollar O
salary O
, O
so O
strangely O
shrunken O
and O
thin O
now O
, O
and O
even O
as O
we O
looked O
we O
saw O
that O
the O
method O
of O
the B-PER
unctuous I-PER
, I-PER
anxious I-PER
stranger I-PER
had O
become O
antiquated O
in O
its O
turn O

Then O
from O
his O

emerged O
a B-PER
new I-PER
being I-PER

Neither O
urger B-PER

he O

The O

was O
stamped O
across O
his O
brow O

was O
ever O
the O
word O
" O
Service O

Silent O
, O
courteous O
, O
watchful O

alert O
, O
he O
listened O
, O
while O
you O
talked O

His O
method O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
made O
that O
of O
the B-PER
silk-lined I-PER

sound O
like O
the O
hoarse O
hoots O
of O
the B-PER
ballyhoo I-PER
man I-PER
at O

Blithely O
he O
accepted O
five O

gave O
in O

a O
promise O

And O
when O
we O

search O
our O
soul O

low-voiced O

clear-eyed O

stood O
in O

over O

a O

From O

dangled O
a O

Jock B-PER
regarded O

Emma B-PER

turned O
toward O

paused O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
the B-PER
slim I-PER
young I-PER
figure I-PER
, I-PER
in I-PER
its I-PER
English-fitting I-PER
black I-PER

sat O
opposite O
Emma B-PER

between O
excited O
gulps O
of O
coffee O
outlined O
a O
meteoric O
career O

chosen O

And O
the O
more O
he O
talked O
and O
the O
rosier O
his O
figures O
of O
speech O
became O
, O
the O
more O
silent O
and O
thoughtful O
fell O
his B-PER
mother I-PER

She O
wondered O
if O
five O
o'clock O
would O
find O
a O
droop O
to O
the O
set O
of O
those O
young O
shoulders O
; O
if O
the O
springy O
young O
legs O
in O
their O
absurdly O
scant O
modish O
trousers O
would O
have O
lost O
some O
of O
their O
elasticity O
; O
if O
the O
buoyant O
step O
in O
the O
flat-heeled O
shoes O
would O
not O
drag O
a O
little O

Thirteen O
years O
of O

taught O
her O
to O
swallow O
smilingly O
the O
bitter O
pill O
of O
rebuff O

But O
this B-PER
boy I-PER
was O
to O
experience O
his O
first O
dose O
to-day O
. O
She O
felt O
again O
that O
sensation O
of O
almost O
physical O
nausea O
-- O
that O
sickness O
of O
heart O
and O
spirit O
which O
had O
come O
over O
her O
when O
she O
had O
met O
her O
first O
sneer O

intolerant O
shrug O

was O

moving O

in O
its O
policy O

But O
the O
wound O
of O
that O
first O
insult O
still O
ached O
. O
A O
word O
from O
her O
would O
have O
placed O
the B-PER
boy I-PER

saved O
him O
from O
curt O
refusals O

withheld O
that O

across O

down O
complacently O

Emma B-PER

buttered O
her O
bit O
of O

looked O
up O

quietly O

CHAPTER O

-- O
I O
have O
just O
returned O
from O
a O
visit O
to O
my B-PER
landlord I-PER

solitary I-PER

all B-GPE

I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
I O
could O
have O
fixed O
on O
a O
situation O
so O
completely O
removed O
from O
the O
stir O
of O
society O

A O
perfect O
misanthropist B-PER

heaven O
: O
and O
Mr. B-PER
Heathcliff O
and O
I O
are O
such B-PER
a I-PER
suitable I-PER
pair I-PER
to I-PER
divide I-PER
the I-PER
desolation I-PER
between I-PER
us I-PER

A B-PER
capital I-PER
fellow I-PER

little O
imagined O
how O
my B-PER
heart I-PER
warmed O
towards O
him O
when O
I O
beheld O
his O
black O
eyes O
withdraw O
so O
suspiciously O
under O
their O
brows O
, O
as O
I O
rode O
up O
, O
and O
when O
his O
fingers O
sheltered O
themselves O
, O
with O
a O
jealous O
resolution O
, O
still O
further O
in O
his O
waistcoat O
, O
as O
I O
announced O
my O
name O
. O
' O
Mr. B-PER
Heathcliff O
? O
' O
I O
said O
. O
A O
nod O
was O
the O
answer O
. O
' O
Mr. B-PER
Lockwood O
, O
your B-PER
new I-PER
tenant I-PER
, O
sir B-PER

I O
do O
myself O
the O
honour O
of O
calling O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
after O
my O
arrival O
, O
to O
express O
the O
hope O
that O
I O
have O
not O
inconvenienced O
you O
by O
my O
perseverance O
in O
soliciting O
the O
occupation O
of O
Thrushcross B-FAC

I O
heard O
yesterday O

inconvenience O
me O

The O
' O
walk O

was O
uttered O
with O
closed O
teeth O

expressed O
the O
sentiment O

to O
the O
Deuce O
: O
' O
even O
the O
gate O
over O
which O
he O
leant O
manifested O
no O
sympathising O
movement O
to O
the O
words O
; O
and O
I O
think O
that O
circumstance O
determined O
me O
to O
accept O
the O
invitation O
: O
I O
felt O
interested O
in O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
seemed I-PER
more I-PER
exaggeratedly I-PER
reserved I-PER
than I-PER
myself I-PER
. O
When O
he O
saw O
my O
horse O
's O
breast O
fairly O
pushing O
the O
barrier O
, O
he O
did O
put O
out O
his O
hand O
to O
unchain O
it O
, O
and O
then O
sullenly O
preceded O
me O
up O
the O
causeway O

calling O

entered O

court O

' O

me O

in O

ejaculation O

Wuthering B-FAC
Heights I-FAC
is O
the O
name O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Heathcliff O
's O
dwelling O
. O
' O
Wuthering O
' O
being O
a O
significant O
provincial O
adjective O
, O
descriptive O
of O
the O
atmospheric O
tumult O
to O
which O
its O
station O
is O
exposed O
in O
stormy O
weather O
. O
Pure O
, O
bracing O
ventilation O
they O
must O
have O
up O
there O
at O
all O
times O
, O
indeed O
: O
one O
may O
guess O
the O
power O
of O
the O
north O
wind O
blowing O
over O
the O
edge O
, O
by O
the O
excessive O
slant O
of O
a O
few O
stunted O
firs O
at O
the B-FAC
end I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
house I-FAC
; O
and O
by O
a O
range O
of O
gaunt O
thorns O
all O
stretching O
their O
limbs O
one O
way O
, O
as O
if O
craving O
alms O
of O
the O
sun O
. O
Happily O
, O
the B-PER
architect I-PER
had O
foresight O
to O
build O
it O
strong O
: O
the O
narrow O
windows O
are O
deeply O
set O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
the B-FAC
corners I-FAC
defended O
with O
large O
jutting O
stones O
. O
Before O
passing O
the O
threshold O
, O
I O
paused O
to O
admire O
a O
quantity O
of O
grotesque O
carving O
lavished O
over O
the B-FAC
front I-FAC
, O
and O
especially O
about O
the O
principal O
door O
; O
above O
which O
, O
among O
a O
wilderness O
of O
crumbling O
griffins O
and O
shameless O
little O
boys O
, O
I O
detected O
the O
date O
' O
1500 O
, O
' O
and O
the O
name O
' O
Hareton B-PER
Earnshaw I-PER
. O
' O
I O
would O
have O
made O
a O
few O
comments O
, O
and O
requested O
a O
short O
history O
of O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
from O
the B-PER
surly I-PER
owner I-PER
; O
but O
his O
attitude O
at O
the O
door O
appeared O
to O
demand O
my O
speedy O
entrance O
, O
or O
complete O
departure O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
aggravate O
his O
impatience O
previous O
to O
inspecting O
the B-FAC
penetralium I-FAC
. O
One O
stop O
brought O
us O
into O
the B-FAC
family I-FAC
sitting-room I-FAC
, O
without O
any B-FAC
introductory I-FAC
lobby I-FAC
or O
passage B-FAC
: O
they O
call O
it O
here O
' B-FAC
the I-FAC
house I-FAC
' I-FAC
pre-eminently O
. O
It O
includes O
kitchen B-FAC
and O
parlour B-FAC
, O
generally O
; O
but O
I O
believe O
at O
Wuthering B-FAC
Heights I-FAC
the B-FAC
kitchen I-FAC
is O
forced O
to O
retreat O
altogether O
into O
another B-FAC
quarter I-FAC
: O
at O
least O
I O
distinguished O
a O
chatter O
of O
tongues O
, O
and O
a O
clatter O
of O
culinary O
utensils O
, O
deep O
within O
; O
and O
I O
observed O
no O
signs O
of O
roasting O
, O
boiling O
, O
or O
baking O
, O
about O
the O
huge O
fireplace O
; O
nor O
any O
glitter O
of O
copper O
saucepans O
and O
tin O
cullenders O
on O
the O
walls O
. O
One O
end O
, O
indeed O
, O
reflected O
splendidly O
both O
light O
and O
heat O
from O
ranks O
of O
immense O
pewter O
dishes O
, O
interspersed O
with O
silver O
jugs O
and O
tankards O
, O
towering O
row O
after O
row O
, O
on O
a O
vast O
oak O
dresser O
, O
to O
the O
very O
roof O
. O
The O
latter O
had O
never O
been O
under-drawn O
: O
its O
entire O
anatomy O
lay O
bare O
to O
an O
inquiring O
eye O
, O
except O
where O
a O
frame O
of O
wood O
laden O
with O
oatcakes O
and O
clusters O
of O
legs O
of O
beef O
, O
mutton O
, O
and O
ham O
, O
concealed O
it O
. O
Above O
the O
chimney O
were O
sundry O
villainous O
old O
guns O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
horse-pistols O
: O
and O
, O
by O
way O
of O
ornament O
, O
three O
gaudily-painted O
canisters O
disposed O
along O
its O
ledge O
. O
The O
floor O
was O
of O
smooth O
, O
white O
stone O
; O
the O
chairs O
, O
high-backed O
, O
primitive O
structures O
, O
painted O
green O
: O
one O
or O
two O
heavy O
black O
ones O
lurking O
in O
the O
shade O
. O
In O
an O
arch O
under O
the O
dresser O
reposed O
a O
huge O
, O
liver-coloured O
bitch O
pointer O
, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
swarm O
of O
squealing O
puppies O
; O
and O
other O
dogs O
haunted O
other O
recesses O
. O
The B-FAC
apartment I-FAC
and O
furniture O
would O
have O
been O
nothing O
extraordinary O
as O
belonging O
to O
a B-PER
homely I-PER
, I-PER
northern I-PER
farmer I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
stubborn I-PER
countenance I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
stalwart I-PER
limbs I-PER
set I-PER
out I-PER
to I-PER
advantage I-PER
in I-PER
knee-breeches I-PER
and I-PER
gaiters I-PER
. O
Such B-PER
an I-PER
individual I-PER
seated O
in O
his O
arm-chair O
, O
his O
mug O
of O
ale O
frothing O
on O
the O
round O
table O
before O
him O
, O
is O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
any O
circuit O
of O
five O
or O
six O
miles O
among O
these O
hills O
, O
if O
you O
go O
at O
the O
right O
time O
after O
dinner O
. O
But O
Mr. B-PER
Heathcliff O
forms O
a O
singular O
contrast O
to O
his B-FAC
abode I-FAC
and O
style O
of O
living O
. O
He B-PER
is I-PER
a I-PER
dark-skinned I-PER
gipsy I-PER
in O
aspect O
, O
in O
dress O
and O
manners O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
: O
that O
is O
, O
as O
much O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
as O
many B-PER
a I-PER
country I-PER
squire I-PER
: O
rather O
slovenly O
, O
perhaps O
, O
yet O
not O
looking O
amiss O
with O
his O
negligence O
, O
because O
he O
has O
an O
erect O
and O
handsome O
figure O
; O
and O
rather O
morose O
. O
Possibly O
, O
some B-PER
people I-PER
might O
suspect O
him O
of O
a O
degree O
of O
under-bred O
pride O
; O
I O
have O
a O
sympathetic O
chord O
within O
that O
tells O
me O
it O
is O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
: O
I O
know O
, O
by O
instinct O
, O
his O
reserve O
springs O
from O
an O
aversion O
to O
showy O
displays O
of O
feeling O
-- O
to O
manifestations O
of O
mutual O
kindliness O
. O
He O
'll O
love O
and O
hate O
equally O
under O
cover O
, O
and O
esteem O
it O
a O
species O
of O
impertinence O
to O
be O
loved O
or O
hated O
again O
. O
No O
, O
I O
'm O
running O
on O
too O
fast O
: O
I O
bestow O
my O
own O
attributes O
over-liberally O
on O
him O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Heathcliff O
may O
have O
entirely O
dissimilar O
reasons O
for O
keeping O
his O
hand O
out O
of O
the O
way O
when O
he O
meets O
a O
would-be O
acquaintance O
, O
to O
those O
which O
actuate O
me O
. O
Let O
me O
hope O
my O
constitution O
is O
almost O
peculiar O
: O
my B-PER
dear I-PER
mother I-PER
used O
to O
say O
I O
should O
never O
have O
a B-FAC
comfortable I-FAC
home I-FAC
; O
and O
only O
last O
summer O
I O
proved O
myself O
perfectly O
unworthy O
of O
one O
. O
While O
enjoying O
a O
month O
of O
fine O
weather O
at O
the B-LOC
sea-coast I-LOC
, O
I O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
company O
of O
a B-PER
most I-PER
fascinating I-PER
creature I-PER
: O
a B-PER
real I-PER
goddess I-PER
in I-PER
my I-PER
eyes I-PER
, O
as O
long O
as O
she O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
me O
. O
I O
' O
never O
told O
my O
love O
' O
vocally O
; O
still O
, O
if O
looks O
have O
language O
, O
the B-PER
merest I-PER
idiot I-PER
might O
have O
guessed O
I O
was O
over O
head O
and O
ears O
: O
she O
understood O
me O
at O
last O
, O
and O
looked O
a O
return O
-- O
the O
sweetest O
of O
all O
imaginable O
looks O
. O
And O
what O
did O
I O
do O
? O
I O
confess O
it O
with O
shame O
-- O
shrunk O
icily O
into O
myself O
, O
like O
a O
snail O
; O
at O
every O
glance O
retired O
colder O
and O
farther O
; O
till O
finally O
the B-PER
poor I-PER
innocent I-PER
was O
led O
to O
doubt O
her O
own O
senses O
, O
and O
, O
overwhelmed O
with O
confusion O
at O
her O
supposed O
mistake O
, O
persuaded O
her B-PER
mamma I-PER
to O
decamp O
. O
By O
this O
curious O
turn O
of O
disposition O
I O
have O
gained O
the O
reputation O
of O
deliberate O
heartlessness O
; O
how O
undeserved O
, O
I O
alone O
can O
appreciate O
. O
I O
took O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
hearthstone O
opposite O
that O
towards O
which O
my B-PER
landlord I-PER
advanced O
, O
and O
filled O
up O
an O
interval O
of O
silence O
by O
attempting O
to O
caress O
the O
canine O
mother O
, O
who O
had O
left O
her O
nursery O
, O
and O
was O
sneaking O
wolfishly O
to O
the O
back O
of O
my O
legs O
, O
her O
lip O
curled O
up O
, O
and O
her O
white O
teeth O
watering O
for O
a O
snatch O
. O
My O
caress O
provoked O
a O
long O
, O
guttural O
gnarl O
. O
' O
You O

let O
the O

, O

growled O
Mr. B-PER

in O

checking O

with O
a O

again O

indistinctly O
in O
the B-FAC
depths I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC

but O
gave O
no O
intimation O
of O
ascending O

so O
his B-PER
master I-PER
dived O
down O
to O
him O
, O
leaving O
me O

vis-a-vis O

the O
ruffianly O
bitch O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
grim O
shaggy O
sheep-dogs O

who O
shared O
with O
her O
a O
jealous O
guardianship O
over O
all O
my O
movements O

Not O
anxious O
to O
come O
in O
contact O
with O
their O
fangs O
, O
I O
sat O
still O
; O
but O
, O
imagining O
they O
would O
scarcely O
understand O
tacit O
insults O
, O
I O
unfortunately O
indulged O
in O
winking O
and O
making O
faces O
at O
the O
trio O
, O
and O
some O
turn O
of O
my O
physiognomy O
so O
irritated O
madam O

that O
she O
suddenly O
broke O
into O
a O
fury O

leapt O
on O
my O
knees O

I O
flung O
her O
back O

and O
hastened O
to O
interpose O
the O
table O

This O

aroused O

half-a-dozen O

issued O
from O

I O
felt O
my O

peculiar O

parrying O
off O
the O
larger O

as O
effectually O
as O
I O
could O
with O

I O
was O
constrained O
to O
demand O

aloud O

assistance O
from O
some O
of O
the B-FAC
household I-FAC
in O
re-establishing O
peace O

Mr. B-PER
Heathcliff O
and O
his B-PER

climbed O
the O

with O
vexatious O
phlegm O

at O

by O

the O

in O

the O

a O
few O

looked O
at O
the O

gazed O

the B-LOC

now O
passing O
in O
swift O
review O

her O
swifter O

replaced O
its O

one O

her O

with O

pretty O

possessed O
of O
a O
figure O

shapeliness O

an O
eye O
alight O

she O
was O

two B-PER

could O
scarcely O

almost O

were O
set O

she O
was O
interested O

quick O

keener O

ambitious O

A B-PER
half-equipped I-PER
little I-PER
knight I-PER

venturing O

reconnoitre O
the B-GPE
mysterious I-GPE

dreaming O
wild O
dreams O

some O
vague O

“ O

she O
answered O
nervously O
. O
The B-VEH
train I-VEH
was O
just O
pulling O
out O
of O
Waukesha B-GPE

For O
some O
time O
she O
had O
been O
conscious O

a B-PER
man I-PER

She O
felt O
him O
observing O
her O
mass O
of O
hair O
. O
He O
had O
been O
fidgetting O
, O
and O
with O
natural O
intuition O
she O
felt O
a O
certain O
interest O
growing O
in O
that O
quarter O
. O
Her O
maidenly O
reserve O
, O
and O
a O
certain O
sense O
of O
what O
was O
conventional O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
called O
her O
to O
forestall O
and O
deny O
this O
familiarity O
, O
but O
the O
daring O
and O
magnetism O
of O
the B-PER
individual I-PER
, O
born O
of O
past O
experiences O
and O
triumphs O
, O
prevailed O

She O
answered O
. O
He O
leaned O
forward O
to O
put O
his O
elbows O
upon O
the O
back O
of O
her O
seat O
and O
proceeded O
to O
make O
himself O
volubly O
agreeable O
. O
“ O
Yes O

observed O

She O
now O
turned O

looked O
upon O
him O
in O
full O
, O
the O
instincts O

self-protection O

coquetry O
mingling O
confusedly O
in O
her O
brain O

“ O
I O
did O

say O
that O

she O
said O
. O
“ O
Oh O

he O
answered O
, O
in O
a O
very O
pleasing O
way O

with O
an O
assumed O
air O
of O
mistake O
, O
“ O

Here O
was O

He O
came O
within O
the O
meaning O
of O
a O
still O
newer O
term O

which O
had O
sprung O
into O
general O
use O
among O
Americans B-PER
in O
1880 O

which O
concisely O
expressed O
the O
thought O

His O

bore O
several O

the O
ever-enduring O
heavy O

from O
his O

suspended O
the O
secret O

the B-ORG
Order I-ORG

The O
whole O
suit O
was O
rather O
tight-fitting O

was O
finished O
off O
with O
heavy-soled O
tan O

attractive O

and O
whatever O

you O
may O
be O

was O
not O
lost O
upon O
Carrie B-PER

in O
this O

her O
first O
glance O

Lest O
this O
order O
of O
individual B-PER
should O
permanently O
pass O
, O
let O
me O
put O
down O
some O
of O
the O
most O
striking O
characteristics O
of O
his O
most O
successful O
manner O
and O
method O
. O
Good O
clothes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
were O
the O
first O
essential O
, O
the O
things O
without O
which O
he O
was O
nothing O
. O
A O
strong O
physical O
nature O
, O
actuated O
by O
a O
keen O
desire O
for O
the O
feminine O
, O
was O
the O
next O
. O
A O
mind O
free O
of O
any O
consideration O
of O
the O
problems O
or O
forces O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
and O
actuated O
not O
by O
greed O
, O
but O
an O
insatiable O
love O
of O
variable O
pleasure O
. O
His O
method O
was O
always O
simple O
. O
Its O
principal O
element O
was O
daring O
, O
backed O
, O
of O
course O
, O
by O
an O
intense O
desire O
and O
admiration O
for O
the O
sex O
. O
Let O
him O
meet O
with O
a B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
once O
and O
he O
would O
approach O
her O
with O
an O
air O
of O
kindly O
familiarity O
, O
not O
unmixed O
with O
pleading O
, O
which O
would O
result O
in O
most O
cases O
in O
a O
tolerant O
acceptance O
. O
If O
she O
showed O
any O
tendency O
to O
coquetry O
he O
would O
be O
apt O
to O
straighten O
her O
tie O
, O
or O
if O
she O
“ O
took O
up O
” O
with O
him O
at O
all O
, O
to O
call O
her O
by O
her O
first O
name O
. O
If O
he O
visited O
a B-FAC
department I-FAC
store I-FAC
it O
was O
to O
lounge O
familiarly O
over O
the O
counter O
and O
ask O
some O
leading O
questions O
. O
In O
more O
exclusive O
circles O
, O
on O
the B-VEH
train I-VEH
or O
in O
waiting B-FAC
stations I-FAC
, O
he O
went O
slower O
. O
If O
some O
seemingly O
vulnerable O
object O
appeared O
he O
was O
all O
attention O
-- O
to O
pass O
the O
compliments O
of O
the O
day O
, O
to O
lead O
the O
way O
to O
the B-VEH
parlor I-VEH
car I-VEH
, O
carrying O
her O
grip O
, O
or O
, O
failing O
that O
, O
to O
take O
a O

next O
her O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
able O
to O
court O
her O

her O
destination O

Pillows O

books O
, O
a O
footstool O
, O
the O
shade O
lowered O
; O
all O
these O
figured O
in O
the O
things O
which O
he O
could O
do O
. O
If O
, O
when O
she O
reached O
her O
destination O
he O
did O
not O
alight O
and O
attend O
her O
baggage O
for O
her O
, O
it O
was O
because O
, O
in O
his O
own O
estimation O
, O
he O
had O
signally O
failed O
. O
A B-PER
woman I-PER
should O
some O
day O
write O
the O
complete O
philosophy O
of O
clothes O
. O
No O
matter O
how O
young O
, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
things O
she O
wholly O
comprehends O
. O
There O
is O
an O
indescribably O
faint O
line O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
man B-PER
's O
apparel O
which O
somehow O
divides O
for O
her O
those B-PER
who I-PER
are I-PER
worth I-PER
glancing I-PER
at I-PER
and O
those B-PER
who I-PER
are I-PER
not I-PER
. O
Once O
an B-PER
individual I-PER
has O
passed O
this O
faint O
line O
on O
the O
way O
downward O
he O
will O
get O
no O
glance O
from O
her O
. O
There O
is O
another O
line O
at O
which O
the O
dress O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
will O
cause O
her O
to O
study O
her O
own O
. O
This O
line O
the B-PER
individual I-PER
at I-PER
her I-PER
elbow I-PER
now O
marked O
for O
Carrie B-PER
. O
She O
became O
conscious O
of O
an O
inequality O
. O
Her O
own O
plain O
blue O
dress O
, O
with O
its O
black O
cotton O
tape O
trimmings O
, O
now O
seemed O
to O
her O
shabby O
. O
She O
felt O
the O
worn O
state O
of O
her O
shoes O
. O
“ O
Let O
's O
see O
, O
” O
he O
went O
on O
, O
“ O

” O
“ O
Oh O

” O
she O
interrupted O
, O
aroused O
by O
memories O
of O
longings O
their O
show O
windows O
had O
cost O
her O
. O
At O
last O
he O
had O
a O
clew O
to O
her O
interest O
, O
and O
followed O
it O
deftly O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
he O
had O
come O
about O
into O
her O
seat O
. O
He O
talked O
of O
sales O
of O
clothing O
, O
his O
travels O
, O
Chicago B-GPE

and O
the O
amusements O
of O

” O
“ O
I O

” O
she O
explained O
. O
“ O
You O
want O
to O
see O
Lincoln B-FAC

he O
said O

“ O

” O
There O
was O
a O
little O
ache O
in O
her O
fancy O
of O
all O
he O
described O
. O
Her O
insignificance O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
so O
much O
magnificence O
faintly O
affected O
her O
. O
She O
realised O
that O
hers O
was O
not O
to O
be O
a O
round O
of O
pleasure O
, O
and O
yet O
there O
was O
something O
promising O
in O
all O
the O
material O
prospect O
he O
set O
forth O
. O
There O
was O
something O
satisfactory O
in O
the O
attention O
of O
this O
individual O
with O
his O
good O
clothes O
. O
She O
could O
not O
help O
smiling O
as O
he O
told O
her O
of O
some B-PER
popular I-PER
actress I-PER
of I-PER
whom I-PER
she I-PER
reminded I-PER
him I-PER
. O
She O
was O
not O
silly O
, O
and O
yet O
attention O
of O
this O
sort O
had O
its O
weight O
. O
_ O
One O

DREAMS O
Night O
fell O
. O
The O
red O
waters O
of O
the B-LOC
swamp I-LOC
grew O
sinister O
and O
sullen O
. O
The O
tall O
pines O
lost O
their O
slimness O
and O
stood O
in O
wide O
blurred O
blotches O
all O
across O
the O
way O
, O
and O
a O
great O
shadowy O
bird O
arose O
, O
wheeled O
and O
melted O
, O
murmuring O
, O
into O
the O
black-green O
sky O
. O
The B-PER
boy I-PER
wearily O
dropped O
his O
heavy O
bundle O
and O
stood O
still O
, O
listening O
as O
the O
voice O
of O
crickets O
split O
the O
shadows O
and O
made O
the O
silence O
audible O
. O
A O
tear O
wandered O
down O
his O
brown O
cheek O
. O
They O
were O
at O
supper O
now O
, O
he O
whispered O
-- O
the B-PER
father I-PER
and O
old B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
away O
back O
yonder O
beyond O
the O
night O
. O
They O
were O
far O
away O
; O
they O
would O
never O
be O
as O
near O
as O
once O
they O
had O
been O
, O
for O
he O
had O
stepped O
into O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
. O
And O
the O
cat O
and O
Old B-PER
Billy I-PER
-- O
ah O
, O
but O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
was O
a O
lonely O
thing O
, O
so O
wide O
and O
tall O
and O
empty O
! O
And O
so O
bare O
, O
so O
bitter O
bare O
! O
Somehow O
he O
had O
never O
dreamed O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
as O
lonely O
before O
; O
he O
had O
fared O
forth O
to O
beckoning O
hands O
and O
luring O
, O
and O
to O
the O
eager O
hum O
of O
human O
voices O
, O
as O
of O
some O
great O
, O
swelling O
music O
. O
Yet O
now O
he O
was O
alone O
; O
the O
empty O
night O
was O
closing O
all O
about O
him O
here B-LOC
in O
a B-LOC
strange I-LOC
land I-LOC
, O
and O
he O
was O
afraid O
. O
The O
bundle O
with O
his O
earthly O
treasure O
had O
hung O
heavy O
and O
heavier O
on O
his O
shoulder O
; O
his O
little O
horde O
of O
money O
was O
tightly O
wadded O
in O
his O
sock O
, O
and O
the B-FAC
school I-FAC
lay O
hidden O
somewhere O
far O
away O
in O
the O
shadows O
. O
He O
wondered O
how O
far O
it O
was O
; O
he O
looked O
and O
harkened O
, O
starting O
at O
his O
own O
heartbeats O
, O
and O
fearing O
more O
and O
more O
the O
long O
dark O
fingers O
of O
the O
night O
. O
Then O
of O
a O
sudden O
up O
from O
the O
darkness O
came O
music O
. O
It O
was O
human O
music O
, O
but O
of O
a O
wildness O
and O
a O
weirdness O
that O
startled O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
as O
it O
fluttered O
and O
danced O
across O
the O
dull O
red O
waters O
of O
the B-LOC
swamp I-LOC
. O
He O
hesitated O
, O
then O
impelled O
by O
some O
strange O
power O
, O
left O
the B-FAC
highway I-FAC
and O
slipped O
into O
the O
forest O
of O
the B-LOC
swamp I-LOC
, O
shrinking O
, O
yet O
following O
the O
song O
hungrily O
and O
half O
forgetting O
his O
fear O
. O
A O
harsher O
, O
shriller O
note O
struck O
in O
as O
of O
many O
and O
ruder O
voices O
; O
but O
above O
it O
flew O
the O
first O
sweet O
music O
, O
birdlike O
, O
abandoned O
, O
and O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
crept O
closer O
. O
The B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
crouched O
ragged O
and O
black O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
black B-LOC
waters I-LOC
. O
An O
old O
chimney O
leaned O
drunkenly O
against O
it O
, O
raging O
with O
fire O
and O
smoke O
, O
while O
through O
the O
chinks O
winked O
red O
gleams O
of O
warmth O
and O
wild O
cheer O
. O
With O
a O
revel O
of O
shouting O
and O
noise O
, O
the O
music O
suddenly O
ceased O
. O
Hoarse O
staccato O
cries O
and O
peals O
of O
laughter O
shook O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
hut I-FAC
, O
and O
as O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
stood O
there O
peering O
through O
the O
black O
trees O
, O
abruptly O
the O
door O
flew O
open O
and O
a O
flood O
of O
light O
illumined O
the O
wood O
. O
Amid O
this O
mighty O
halo O
, O
as O
on O
clouds O
of O
flame O
, O
a B-PER
girl I-PER
was O
dancing O
. O
She O
was O
black O
, O
and O
lithe O
, O
and O
tall O
, O
and O
willowy O
. O
Her O
garments O
twined O
and O
flew O
around O
the O
delicate O
moulding O
of O
her O
dark O
, O
young O
, O
half-naked O
limbs O
. O
A O
heavy O
mass O
of O
hair O
clung O
motionless O
to O
her O
wide O
forehead O
. O
Her O
arms O
twirled O
and O
flickered O
, O
and O
body O
and O
soul O
seemed O
quivering O
and O
whirring O
in O
the O
poetry O
of O
her O
motion O
. O
As O
she O
danced O
she O
sang O
. O
He O
heard O
her O
voice O
as O
before O
, O
fluttering O
like O
a O
bird O
's O
in O
the O
full O
sweetness O
of O
her O
utter O
music O
. O
It O
was O
no O
tune O
nor O
melody O
, O
it O
was O
just O
formless O
, O
boundless O
music O
. O
The B-PER
boy I-PER
forgot O
himself O
and O
all B-LOC
the I-LOC
world I-LOC
besides O
. O
All O
his O
darkness O
was O
sudden O
light O
; O
dazzled O
he O
crept O
forward O
, O
bewildered O
, O
fascinated O
, O
until O
with O
one O
last O
wild O
whirl O
the B-PER
elf-girl I-PER
paused O
. O
The O
crimson O
light O
fell O
full O
upon O
the O
warm O
and O
velvet O
bronze O
of O
her O
face O
-- O
her O
midnight O
eyes O
were O
aglow O
, O
her O
full O
purple O
lips O
apart O
, O
her O
half O
hid O
bosom O
panting O
, O
and O
all O
the O
music O
dead O
. O
Involuntarily O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
gave O
a O
gasping O
cry O
and O
awoke O
to O
swamp B-LOC
and O
night O
and O
fire O
, O
while O
a O
white O
face O
, O
drawn O
, O
red-eyed O
, O
peered O
outward O
from O
some O
hidden O
throng O
within O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
. O
" O
Who O
's O
that O
? O
" O
a O
harsh O
voice O
cried O
. O
" O
Where O
? O
" O
" O
Who O
is O
it O
? O
" O
and O
pale O
crowding O
faces O
blurred O
the O
light O
. O
The B-PER
boy I-PER
wheeled O
blindly O
and O
fled O
in O
terror O
stumbling O
through O
the B-LOC
swamp I-LOC
, O
hearing O
strange O
sounds O
and O
feeling O
stealthy O
creeping O
hands O
and O
arms O
and O
whispering O
voices O
. O
On O
he O
toiled O
in O
mad O
haste O
, O
struggling O
toward O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
and O
losing O
it O
until O
finally O
beneath O
the O
shadows O
of O
a O
mighty O
oak O
he O
sank O
exhausted O
. O
There O
he O
lay O
a O
while O
trembling O
and O
at O
last O
drifted O
into O
dreamless O
sleep O
. O
It O
was O
morning O
when O
he O
awoke O
and O
threw O
a O
startled O
glance O
upward O
to O
the O
twisted O
branches O
of O
the O
oak O
that O
bent O
above O
, O
sifting O
down O
sunshine O
on O
his O
brown O
face O
and O
close O
curled O
hair O
. O
Slowly O
he O
remembered O
the O
loneliness O
, O
the O
fear O
and O
wild O
running O
through O
the O
dark O
. O
He O
laughed O
in O
the O
bold O
courage O
of O
day O
and O
stretched O
himself O
. O
Then O
suddenly O
he O
bethought O
him O
again O
of O
that O
vision O
of O
the O
night O
-- O
the O
waving O
arms O
and O
flying O
limbs O
of O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
, O
and O
her O
great O
black O
eyes O
looking O
into O
the O
night O
and O
calling O
him O
. O
He O
could O
hear O
her O
now O
, O
and O
hear O
that O
wondrous O
savage O
music O
. O
Had O
it O
been O
real O
? O
Had O
he O
dreamed O
? O
Or O
had O
it O
been O
some O
witch-vision O
of O
the O
night O
, O
come O
to O
tempt O
and O
lure O
him O
to O
his O
undoing O
? O
Where O
was O
that B-FAC
black I-FAC
and I-FAC
flaming I-FAC
cabin I-FAC
? O
Where O
was O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
-- O
the B-PER
soul I-PER
that I-PER
had I-PER
called I-PER
him I-PER
? O
_ O
She O
_ O
must O
have O
been O
real O
; O
she O
had O
to O
live O
and O
dance O
and O
sing O
; O
he O
must O
again O
look O
into O
the O
mystery O
of O
her O
great O
eyes O
. O
And O
he O
sat O
up O
in O
sudden O
determination O
, O
and O
, O
lo O
! O
gazed O
straight O
into O
the O
very O
eyes O
of O
his O
dreaming O
. O
She O
sat O
not O
four O
feet O
from O
him O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
great O
tree O
, O
her O
eyes O
now O
languorously O
abstracted O
, O
now O
alert O
and O
quizzical O
with O
mischief O
. O
She O
seemed O
but O
half-clothed O
, O
and O
her O
warm O
, O
dark O
flesh O
peeped O
furtively O
through O
the O
rent O
gown O
; O
her O
thick O
, O
crisp O
hair O
was O
frowsy O
and O
rumpled O
, O
and O
the O
long O
curves O
of O
her O
bare O
young O
arms O
gleamed O
in O
the O
morning O
sunshine O
, O
glowing O
with O
vigor O
and O
life O
. O
A O
little O
mocking O
smile O
came O
and O
sat O
upon O
her O
lips O
. O
" O
What O
you O
run O
for O
? O
" O
she O
asked O
, O
with O
dancing O
mischief O
in O
her O
eyes O
. O
" O
Because O
-- O
" O
he O
hesitated O
, O
and O
his O
cheeks O
grew O
hot O
. O
" O
I O
knows O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
with O
impish O
glee O
, O
laughing O
low O
music O
. O
" O
Why O
? O
" O
he O
challenged O
, O
sturdily O
. O
" O
You O
was O
a-feared O
. O
" O
He O
bridled O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
reckon O
you O
'd O
be O
a-feared O
if O
you O
was O
caught O
out O
in O
the O
black O
dark O
all O
alone O
. O
" O
" O
Pooh O
! O
" O
she O
scoffed O
and O
hugged O
her O
knees O
. O
" O
Pooh O
! O
I O
've O
stayed O
out O
all O
alone O
heaps O
o O
' O
nights O
. O
" O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
a O
curious O
awe O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
you O
, O
" O
he O
asserted O
; O
but O
she O
tossed O
her O
head O
and O
her O
eyes O
grew O
scornful O
. O
" O
Who O
's O
a-feared O
of O
the O
dark O
? O
I O
love O
night O
. O
" O
Her O
eyes O
grew O
soft O
. O
He O
watched O
her O
silently O
, O
till O
, O
waking O
from O
her O
daydream O
, O
she O
abruptly O
asked O
: O
" O
Where O
you O
from O
? O
" O
" O
Georgia B-GPE
. O
" O
" O
Where O
's O
that O
? O
" O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
in O
surprise O
, O
but O
she O
seemed O
matter-of-fact O
. O
" O
It O
's O
away O
over O
yonder O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
. O
" O
Behind O
where O
the O
sun O
comes O
up O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
no O
! O
" O
" O
Then O
it O
ai O
n't O
so O
far O
, O
" O
she O
declared O
. O
" O
I O
knows O
where O
the O
sun O
rises O
, O
and O
I O
knows O
where O
it O
sets O
. O
" O
She O
looked O
up O
at O
its O
gleaming O
splendor O
glinting O
through O
the O
leaves O
, O
and O
, O
noting O
its O
height O
, O
announced O
abruptly O
: O
" O
I O
' O
se O
hungry O
. O
" O
" O
So O
'm O
I O
, O
" O
answered O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
, O
fumbling O
at O
his O
bundle O
; O
and O
then O
, O
timidly O
: O
" O
Will O
you O
eat O
with O
me O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
and O
watched O
him O
with O
eager O
eyes O
. O
Untying O
the O
strips O
of O
cloth O
, O
he O
opened O
his O
box O
, O
and O
disclosed O
chicken O
and O
biscuits O
, O
ham O
and O
corn-bread O
. O
She O
clapped O
her O
hands O
in O
glee O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
any O
water O
near O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
Without O
a O
word O
, O
she O
bounded O
up O
and O
flitted O
off O
like O
a O
brown O
bird O
, O
gleaming O
dull-golden O
in O
the O
sun O
, O
glancing O
in O
and O
out O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
till O
she O
paused O
above O
a B-FAC
tiny I-FAC
black I-FAC
pool I-FAC
, O
and O
then O
came O
tripping O
and O
swaying O
back O
with O
hands O
held O
cupwise O
and O
dripping O
with O
cool O
water O
. O
" O
Drink O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
Obediently O
he O
bent O
over O
the O
little O
hands O
that O
seemed O
so O
soft O
and O
thin O
. O
He O
took O
a O
deep O
draught O
; O
and O
then O
to O
drain O
the O
last O
drop O
, O
his O
hands O
touched O
hers O
and O
the O
shock O
of O
flesh O
first O
meeting O
flesh O
startled O
them O
both O
, O
while O
the O
water O
rained O
through O
. O
A O
moment O
their O
eyes O
looked O
deep O
into O
each O
other O
's O
-- O
a O
timid O
, O
startled O
gleam O
in O
hers O
; O
a O
wonder O
in O
his O
. O
Then O
she O
said O
dreamily O
: O
" O
We O
' O
se O
known O
us O
all O
our O
lives O
, O
and O

He O
hesitated O

" O
Ye O

reckon O
, O
" O
he O
slowly O
returned O
. O
And O
then O
, O
brightening O
, O
he O
asked O
gayly O
: O
" O
And O
we O
'll O
be O
friends B-PER
always O

wo O

" O

Yes O

" O
she O
said O
at O
last O
, O
slowly O
and O
solemnly O
, O
and O
another O
brief O
moment O
they O
stood O
still O
. O
Then O
the O
mischief O
danced O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
a O
song O
bubbled O
on O
her O
lips O
. O
She O
hopped O
to O
the O
tree O
. O
" O
Come O
-- O
eat O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
And O
they O
nestled O
together O
amid O
the O
big O
black O
roots O
of O
the O
oak O
, O
laughing O
and O
talking O
while O
they O
ate O
. O
" O
What O
's O

he O
asked O
pointing O
northward O

the B-PER

her O

" O

she O
glanced O
westward O

and O
the O
fierce O
look O
faded O

Soft O
joy O
crept O
to O
her O
face O
again O

and O
she O
sat O
once O
more O
dreaming O

" O

She O
crouched O
beside O
him O

I O
Dr. B-PER
Howard O
Archie O
had O
just O
come O
up O
from O
a O
game O
of O
pool O
with O
the B-PER
Jewish I-PER
clothier I-PER
and O
two O
traveling O
men O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
staying O
overnight O
in O
Moonstone B-GPE
. O
His B-FAC
offices I-FAC
were O
in O
the B-PER
Duke I-PER
Block I-PER
, O
over O
the B-FAC
drug I-FAC
store I-FAC
. O
Larry B-PER
, O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
's I-PER
man I-PER
, O
had O
lit O
the O
overhead O
light O
in O
the B-FAC
waiting-room I-FAC
and O
the O
double O
student O
's O
lamp O
on O
the O
desk O
in O
the B-FAC
study I-FAC
. O
The O
isinglass O
sides O
of O
the O
hard-coal O
burner O
were O
aglow O
, O
and O
the O
air O
in O
the B-FAC
study I-FAC
was O
so O
hot O
that O
as O
he O
came O
in O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
opened O
the O
door O
into O
his B-FAC
little I-FAC
operating-room I-FAC
, O
where O
there O
was O
no O
stove O
. O
The B-FAC
waiting I-FAC
room I-FAC
was O
carpeted O
and O
stiffly O
furnished O
, O
something O
like O
a B-FAC
country I-FAC
parlor I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
study I-FAC
had O
worn O
, O
unpainted O
floors O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
look O
of O
winter O
comfort O
about O
it O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
's O
flat-top O
desk O
was O
large O
and O
well O
made O
; O
the O
papers O
were O
in O
orderly O
piles O
, O
under O
glass O
weights O
. O
Behind O
the O
stove O
a O
wide O
bookcase O
, O
with O
double O
glass O
doors O
, O
reached O
from O
the O
floor O
to O
the O
ceiling O
. O
It O
was O
filled O
with O
medical O
books O
of O
every O
thickness O
and O
color O
. O
On O
the O
top O
shelf O
stood O
a O
long O
row O
of O
thirty O

forty O
volumes O

bound O
all O
alike O
in O
dark O

As O
the O
doctor O
in O
New B-LOC
England I-LOC
villages O
is O
proverbially O
old O
, O
so O
the O
doctor O
in O
small O
Colorado B-GPE
towns O
twenty-five O
years O
ago O
was O
generally O
young O
. O
Dr. B-PER
Archie O
was O
barely O
thirty O
. O
He O
was O
tall O
, O
with O
massive O
shoulders O
which O
he O
held O
stiffly O
, O
and O
a O
large O
, O
well-shaped O
head O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
distinguished-looking I-PER
man I-PER
, O
for O
that O
part O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
at O
least O
. O
There O
was O
something O
individual O
in O
the O
way O
in O
which O
his O
reddish-brown O
hair O
, O
parted O
cleanly O
at O
the O
side O
, O
bushed O
over O
his O
high O
forehead O
. O
His O
nose O
was O
straight O
and O
thick O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
were O
intelligent O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
curly O
, O
reddish O
mustache O
and O
an O
imperial O
, O
cut O
trimly O
, O
which O
made O
him O
look O
a O
little O
like O
the O
pictures O
of O
Napoleon B-PER
III I-PER
. O
His O
hands O
were O
large O
and O
well O
kept O
, O
but O
ruggedly O
formed O
, O
and O
the O
backs O
were O
shaded O
with O
crinkly O
reddish O
hair O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
blue O
suit O
of O
woolly O
, O
wide-waled O
serge O
; O
the B-PER
traveling I-PER
men I-PER
had O
known O
at O
a O
glance O
that O
it O
was O
made O
by O
a O
Denver B-GPE
tailor O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
was O
always O
well O
dressed O
. O
Dr. B-PER
Archie O
turned O
up O
the B-PER
student I-PER
's O
lamp O
and O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
swivel O
chair O
before O
his O
desk O
. O
He O
sat O
uneasily O
, O
beating O
a O
tattoo O
on O
his O
knees O
with O
his O
fingers O
, O
and O
looked O
about O
him O
as O
if O
he O
were O
bored O
. O
He O
glanced O
at O
his O
watch O
, O
then O
absently O
took O
from O
his O
pocket O
a O
bunch O
of O
small O
keys O
, O
selected O
one O
and O
looked O
at O
it O
. O
A O
contemptuous O
smile O
, O
barely O
perceptible O
, O
played O
on O
his O
lips O
, O
but O
his O
eyes O
remained O
meditative O
. O
Behind O
the O
door O
that O
led O
into O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
, O
under O
his O
buffalo-skin O
driving-coat O
, O
was O
a O
locked O
cupboard O
. O
This O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
opened O
mechanically O
, O
kicking O
aside O
a O
pile O
of O
muddy O
overshoes O
. O
Inside O
, O
on O
the O
shelves O
, O
were O
whiskey O
glasses O
and O
decanters O
, O
lemons O
, O
sugar O

and O
bitters O
. O
Hearing O
a O
step O
in O
the B-FAC
empty I-FAC
, I-FAC
echoing I-FAC
hall I-FAC
without O
, O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
closed O
the O
cupboard O
again O
, O
snapping O
the O
Yale O
lock O
. O
The O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
waiting-room I-FAC
opened O
, O
a B-PER
man I-PER
entered O
and O
came O
on O
into O
the B-FAC
consulting-room I-FAC
. O
“ O
Good-evening O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Kronborg O
, O
” O
said O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
carelessly O
. O
“ O
Sit O
down O
. O
” O
His B-PER
visitor I-PER
was O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
loosely I-PER
built I-PER
man I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
thin I-PER
brown I-PER
beard I-PER
, I-PER
streaked I-PER
with I-PER
gray I-PER
. O
He O
wore O
a O
frock O
coat O
, O
a O
broad-brimmed O
black O
hat O
, O
a O
white O
lawn O
necktie O
, O
and O
steel O
rimmed O
spectacles O
. O
Altogether O
there O
was O
a O
pretentious O
and O
important O
air O
about O
him O
, O
as O
he O
lifted O
the O
skirts O
of O
his O
coat O
and O
sat O
down O
. O
“ O
Good-evening O
, O
doctor B-PER
. O
Can O
you O
step O
around O
to O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
with O
me O
? O
I O
think O
Mrs. B-PER
Kronborg O
will O
need O
you O
this O
evening O
. O
” O
This O
was O
said O
with O
profound O
gravity O
and O
, O
curiously O
enough O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
embarrassment O
. O
“ O
Any O
hurry O
? O
” O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
asked O
over O
his O
shoulder O
as O
he O
went O
into O
his B-FAC
operating-room I-FAC
. O
Mr. B-PER
Kronborg O
coughed O
behind O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
contracted O
his O
brows O
. O
His O
face O
threatened O
at O
every O
moment O
to O
break O
into O
a O
smile O
of O
foolish O
excitement O
. O
He O
controlled O
it O
only O
by O
calling O
upon O
his O
habitual O
pulpit O
manner O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
as O
well O
to O
go O
immediately O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Kronborg O
will O
be O
more O
comfortable O
if O
you O
are O
there O
. O
She O
has O
been O
suffering O
for O
some O
time O
. O
” O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
came O
back O
and O
threw O
a O
black O
bag O
upon O
his O
desk O
. O
He O
wrote O
some O
instructions O
for O
his B-PER
man I-PER
on O
a O
prescription O
pad O
and O
then O
drew O
on O
his O
overcoat O
. O
“ O
All O
ready O
, O
” O
he O
announced O
, O
putting O
out O
his O
lamp O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Kronborg O
rose O
and O
they O
tramped O
through O
the B-FAC
empty I-FAC
hall I-FAC
and O
down O
the B-FAC
stairway I-FAC
to O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
. O
The B-FAC
drug I-FAC
store I-FAC
below O
was O
dark O
, O
and O
the B-FAC
saloon I-FAC
next O
door O
was O
just O
closing O
. O
Every O
other O
light O
on O
Main B-FAC
Street I-FAC
was O
out O

On O
either O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
and O
at O
the O
outer O
edge O
of O
the B-FAC
board I-FAC
sidewalk I-FAC
, O
the O
snow O
had O
been O
shoveled O
into O
breastworks O

The B-GPE
town I-GPE
looked O
small O
and O
black O
, O
flattened O
down O
in O
the O
snow O
, O
muffled O

extinguished O
. O
Overhead O
the O
stars O
shone O
gloriously O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
notice O
them O
. O
The O
air O
was O
so O
clear O
that O
the O
white O
sand O
hills O
to O
the O
east O
of O
Moonstone B-GPE
gleamed O
softly O
. O
Following O
the B-PER
Reverend I-PER
Mr. B-PER
Kronborg O
along O
the B-FAC
narrow I-FAC
walk I-FAC
, O
past O
the B-FAC
little I-FAC
dark I-FAC
, I-FAC
sleeping I-FAC
houses I-FAC
, O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
looked O
up O
at O
the O
flashing O
night O
and O
whistled O
softly O
. O
It O
did O
seem O
that O
people B-PER
were O
stupider O
than O
they O
need O
be O
; O
as O
if O
on O
a O
night O
like O
this O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
something O
better O
to O
do O
than O
to O
sleep O
nine O
hours O
, O
or O
to O
assist O
Mrs. B-PER
Kronborg O
in O
functions O
which O
she O
could O
have O
performed O
so O
admirably O
unaided O
. O
He O
wished O
he O
had O
gone O
down O
to O
Denver B-GPE
to O
hear O
Fay B-PER
Templeton I-PER
sing O
“ O
See-Saw O
. O
” O
Then O
he O
remembered O
that O
he O
had O
a O
personal O
interest O
in O
this B-PER
family I-PER
, O
after O
all O
. O
They O
turned O
into O
another B-FAC
street I-FAC
and O
saw O
before O
them O
lighted O
windows O
; O
a O
low O
story-and-a-half O
house O
, O
with O
a O
wing O
built O
on O
at O
the O
right O
and O
a O
kitchen B-FAC
addition O
at O
the O
back O
, O
everything O
a O
little O
on O
the O
slant O
-- O
roofs O
, O
windows O
, O
and O
doors O
. O
As O
they O
approached O
the O
gate O
, O
Peter B-PER
Kronborg I-PER
's O
pace O
grew O
brisker O
. O
His O
nervous O
, O
ministerial O
cough O
annoyed O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
. O
“ O
Exactly O
as O
if O
he O
were O
going O
to O
give O
out O
a O
text O
, O
” O
he O
thought O
. O
He O
drew O
off O
his O
glove O
and O
felt O
in O
his O
vest O
pocket O
. O
“ O
Have O
a O
troche O
, O
Kronborg B-PER
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
producing O
some O
. O
“ O
Sent O
me O
for O
samples O
. O
Very O
good O
for O
a O
rough O
throat O
. O
” O
“ O
Ah O
, O
thank O
you O
, O
thank O
you O
. O
I O
was O
in O
something O
of O
a O
hurry O
. O
I O
neglected O
to O
put O
on O
my O
overshoes O
. O
Here O
we O
are O
, O
doctor B-PER
. O
” O
Kronborg B-PER
opened O
his O
front O
door O
-- O
seemed O
delighted O
to O
be O
at O
home B-FAC
again O
. O
The B-FAC
front I-FAC
hall I-FAC
was O
dark O
and O
cold O
; O
the O
hatrack O
was O
hung O
with O
an O
astonishing O
number O
of O
children B-PER
's O
hats O
and O
caps O
and O
cloaks O
. O
They O
were O
even O
piled O
on O
the O
table O
beneath O
the O
hatrack O
. O
Under O
the O
table O
was O
a O
heap O
of O
rubbers O
and O
overshoes O
. O
While O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
hung O
up O
his O
coat O
and O
hat O
, O
Peter B-PER
Kronborg I-PER
opened O
the O
door O
into O
the B-FAC
living-room I-FAC
. O
A O
glare O
of O
light O
greeted O
them O
, O
and O
a O
rush O
of O
hot O
, O
stale O
air O
, O
smelling O
of O
warming O
flannels O
. O
At O
three O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
Dr. B-PER
Archie O
was O
in O
the B-FAC
parlor I-FAC
putting O
on O
his O
cuffs O
and O
coat O
-- O
there O
was O
no B-FAC
spare I-FAC
bedroom I-FAC
in O
that B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
Peter B-PER
Kronborg I-PER
's O
seventh O
child O
, O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
, O
was O
being O
soothed O
and O
cosseted O
by O
his B-PER
aunt I-PER
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Kronborg O
was O
asleep O
, O
and O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
was O
going O
home B-FAC
. O
But O
he O
wanted O
first O
to O
speak O
to O
Kronborg B-PER
, O
who O
, O
coatless O
and O
fluttery O
, O
was O
pouring O
coal O
into O
the O
kitchen B-FAC
stove O
. O
As O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
crossed O
the B-FAC
dining-room I-FAC
he O
paused O
and O
listened O
. O
From O
one O
of O
the B-FAC
wing I-FAC
rooms I-FAC
, O
off O
to O
the O
left O
, O
he O
heard O
rapid O
, O
distressed O
breathing O
. O
He O
went O
to O
the O
kitchen B-FAC
door O
. O
“ O
One O
of O
the B-PER
children I-PER
sick O
in O
there B-FAC
? O
” O
he O
asked O
, O
nodding O
toward O
the O
partition O
. O
Kronborg B-PER
hung O
up O
the O
stove-lifter O
and O
dusted O
his O
fingers O
. O
“ O
It O
must O
be O
Thea B-PER
. O
I O
meant O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
look O
at O
her O
. O
She O
has O
a O
croupy O
cold O
. O
But O
in O
my O
excitement O
-- O
Mrs. B-PER
Kronborg O
is O
doing O
finely O
, O
eh O
, O
doctor B-PER
? O
Not O
many O
of O
your B-PER
patients I-PER
with O
such O
a O
constitution O
, O
I O
expect O
. O
” O
“ O
Oh O
, O
yes O
. O
She O
's O
a B-PER
fine I-PER
mother I-PER
. O
” O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
took O
up O
the O
lamp O
from O
the O
kitchen B-FAC
table O
and O
unceremoniously O
went O
into O
the B-FAC
wing I-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
Two B-PER
chubby I-PER
little I-PER
boys I-PER
were O
asleep O
in O
a O
double O
bed O
, O
with O
the O
coverlids O
over O
their O
noses O

their O
feet O
drawn O
up O

In O
a O
single O
bed O
, O
next O
to O
theirs O
, O
lay O
a B-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
of I-PER
eleven I-PER
, O
wide O
awake O
, O
two O
yellow O
braids O
sticking O
up O
on O
the O
pillow O
behind O
her O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
scarlet O
and O
her O
eyes O
were O
blazing O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
shut O
the O
door O
behind O
him O
. O
“ O
Feel O
pretty O
sick O
, O
Thea B-PER
? O
” O
he O
asked O
as O
he O
took O
out O
his O
thermometer O
. O
“ O
Why O
did O
n't O
you O
call O
somebody B-PER
? O
” O
She O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
greedy O
affection O
. O
“ O
I O
thought O
you O
were O
here O
, O
” O
she O
spoke O
between O
quick O
breaths O
. O
“ O
There O
is O
a B-PER
new I-PER
baby I-PER
, O
is O
n't O
there O
? O
Which O
? O
” O
“ O
Which O
? O
” O
repeated O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
. O
“ O
Brother B-PER
or O
sister B-PER
? O
” O
He O
smiled O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
bed O
. O
“ O
Brother B-PER
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
taking O
her O
hand O
. O
“ O
Open O
. O
” O
“ O
Good O
. O
Brothers B-PER
are O
better O
, O
” O
she O
murmured O
as O
he O
put O
the O
glass O
tube O
under O
her O
tongue O
. O
“ O
Now O
, O
be O
still O
, O
I O
want O
to O
count O

” O
Dr. B-PER
Archie O
reached O
for O
her O
hand O
and O
took O
out O
his O
watch O
. O
When O
he O
put O
her O
hand O
back O
under O
the O
quilt O
he O
went O
over O
to O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
-- O
they O
were O
both O
tight O
shut O
-- O
and O
lifted O
it O
a O
little O
way O
. O
He O
reached O
up O
and O
ran O
his O
hand O
along O
the O
cold O
, O
unpapered O
wall O

“ O
Keep O

the O
covers O

I O

he O
said O
, O
bending O
over O
the O
glass O
lamp O
with O
his O
thermometer O
. O
He O
winked O
at O
her O
from O
the O
door O
before O
he O
shut O
it O
. O
Peter B-PER
Kronborg I-PER

sitting O
in O
his B-PER
wife I-PER

holding O
the O

His O
air O
of O
cheerful O
importance O

his O
beard O

glasses O

even O
his O
shirt-sleeves O

annoyed O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER

He O
beckoned O
Kronborg B-PER
into O
the B-FAC
living-room I-FAC

said O
sternly O
: O

“ O

CHAPTER O
I O
A B-PER
RED-HAIRED I-PER
GIRL I-PER
The O
residence O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Peter O
Pett O
, O
the B-PER
well-known I-PER
financier I-PER
, O
on O
Riverside B-FAC
Drive I-FAC
is O
one O
of O
the O
leading O
eyesores O
of O
that B-FAC
breezy I-FAC
and I-FAC
expensive I-FAC
boulevard I-FAC
. O
As O
you O
pass O
by O
in O
your B-VEH
limousine I-VEH
, O
or O
while O
enjoying O
ten O
cents O
worth O
of O
fresh O
air O
on O
top O
of O
a B-VEH
green I-VEH
omnibus I-VEH
, O
it O
jumps O
out O
and O
bites O
at O
you O
. O
Architects B-PER
, O
confronted O
with O
it O
, O
reel O
and O
throw O
up O
their O
hands O
defensively O
, O
and O
even O
the B-PER
lay I-PER
observer I-PER
has O
a O
sense O
of O
shock O
. O
The B-FAC
place I-FAC
resembles O
in O
almost O
equal O
proportions O
a B-FAC
cathedral I-FAC
, O
a B-FAC
suburban I-FAC
villa I-FAC
, O
a B-FAC
hotel I-FAC
and O
a B-FAC
Chinese I-FAC
pagoda I-FAC
. O
Many O
of O
its O
windows O
are O
of O
stained O
glass O
, O
and O
above O
the B-FAC
porch I-FAC
stand O
two O
terra-cotta O
lions O
, O
considerably O
more O
repulsive O
even O
than O
the O
complacent O
animals O
which O
guard O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
's O
Public O
Library O
. O
It O
is O
a B-FAC
house I-FAC
which I-FAC
is I-FAC
impossible I-FAC
to I-FAC
overlook I-FAC
: O
and O
it O
was O
probably O
for O
this O
reason O
that O
Mrs. B-PER
Pett O
insisted O
on O
her B-PER
husband I-PER
buying O
it O
, O
for O
she O
was O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
who I-PER
liked I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
noticed I-PER
. O
Through O
the O
rich O
interior O
of O
this B-FAC
mansion I-FAC
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
, O
its B-PER
nominal I-PER
proprietor I-PER
, O
was O
wandering O
like O
a B-PER
lost I-PER
spirit I-PER
. O
The O
hour O
was O
about O
ten O
of O
a O
fine O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
but O
the O
Sabbath O
calm O
which O
was O
upon O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
had O
not O
communicated O
itself O
to O
him O
. O
There O
was O
a O
look O
of O
exasperation O
on O
his O
usually O
patient O
face O
, O
and O
a O
muttered O
oath O
, O
picked O
up O
no O
doubt O
on O
the B-FAC
godless I-FAC
Stock I-FAC
Exchange I-FAC
, O
escaped O
his O
lips O
. O
" O
Darn O
it O
! O
" O
He O
was O
afflicted O
by O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
pathos O
of O
his O
position O
. O
It O
was O
not O
as O
if O
he O
demanded O
much O
from O
life O
. O
He O
asked O
but O
little O
here O
below O
. O
At O
that O
moment O
all O
that O
he O
wanted O
was O
a O
quiet O
spot O
where O
he O
might O
read O
his O
Sunday O
paper O
in O
solitary O
peace O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
find O
one O
. O
Intruders B-PER
lurked O
behind O
every O
door O
. O
The B-FAC
place I-FAC
was O
congested O
. O
This O
sort O
of O
thing O
had O
been O
growing O
worse O
and O
worse O
ever O
since O
his O
marriage O
two O
years O
previously O
. O
There O
was O
a O
strong O
literary O
virus O
in O
Mrs. B-PER
Pett O
's O
system O
. O
She O
not O
only O
wrote O
voluminously O
herself O
-- O
the O
name O
Nesta B-PER
Ford I-PER
Pett I-PER
is O
familiar O
to O
all B-PER
lovers I-PER
of I-PER
sensational I-PER
fiction I-PER
-- O
but O
aimed O
at O
maintaining O
a O
salon O
. O
Starting O
, O
in O
pursuance O
of O
this O
aim O
, O
with O
a B-PER
single I-PER
specimen I-PER
, O
-- O
her B-PER
nephew I-PER
, O
Willie B-PER
Partridge I-PER
, O
who O
was O
working O
on O
a O
new O
explosive O
which O
would O
eventually O
revolutionise O
war O
-- O
she O
had O
gradually O
added O
to O
her O
collections O
, O
until O
now O
she O
gave O
shelter O
beneath O
her O
terra-cotta O
roof O
to O
no O
fewer O
than O
six B-PER
young I-PER
and I-PER
unrecognised I-PER
geniuses I-PER

Six B-PER
brilliant I-PER
youths I-PER
, O
mostly B-PER
novelists I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
not I-PER
yet I-PER
started I-PER
and O
poets B-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
about I-PER
to I-PER
begin I-PER
, O
cluttered O
up O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O

rooms O
on O
this O
fair O
June O
morning O
, O
while O
he O
, O
clutching O
his O
Sunday O
paper O
, O
wandered O
about O
, O
finding O
, O
like O
the O
dove O
in O
Genesis O
, O
no O
rest O
. O
It O
was O
at O
such O
times O
that O
he O
was O
almost O
inclined O
to O
envy O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
's O
first O
husband O
, O
a B-PER
business I-PER
friend I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
named O
Elmer B-PER
Ford I-PER
, O
who O
had O
perished O
suddenly O
of O
an O
apoplectic O
seizure O
: O
and O
the O
pity O
which O
he O
generally O
felt O
for O
the B-PER
deceased I-PER
tended O
to O
shift O
its O
focus O
. O
Marriage O
had O
certainly O
complicated O
life O
for O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
, O
as O
it O
frequently O
does O
for O
the B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
waits I-PER
fifty I-PER
years I-PER
before I-PER
trying I-PER
it I-PER
. O
In O
addition O
to O
the B-PER
geniuses I-PER
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Pett O
had O
brought O
with O
her O
to O
her B-FAC
new I-FAC
home I-FAC
her B-PER
only I-PER
son I-PER
, O
Ogden B-PER
, O
a B-PER
fourteen-year-old I-PER
boy I-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
singularly I-PER
unloveable I-PER
type I-PER
. O
Years O
of O
grown-up O
society O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
anything O
approaching O
discipline O
had O
given O
him O
a O
precocity O
on O
which O
the O
earnest O
efforts O
of O
a O
series O
of O
private B-PER
tutors I-PER
had O
expended O
themselves O
in O
vain O
. O
They O
came O
, O
full O
of O
optimism O
and O
self-confidence O
, O
to O
retire O
after O
a O
brief O
interval O
, O
shattered O
by O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
's O
stodgy O
resistance O
to O
education O
in O
any O
form O
or O
shape O
. O
To O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
, O
never O
at O
his O
ease O
with O
boys B-PER
, O
Ogden B-PER
Ford I-PER
was O
a O
constant O
irritant O
. O
He O
disliked O
his B-PER
stepson I-PER
's O
personality O
, O
and O
he O
more O
than O
suspected O
him O
of O
stealing O
his O
cigarettes O
. O
It O
was O
an O
additional O
annoyance O
that O
he O
was O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
impossibility O
of O
ever O
catching O
him O
at O
it O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
resumed O
his O
journey O
. O
He O
had O
interrupted O
it O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
listen O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
morning-room I-FAC
, O
but O
, O
a O
remark O
in O
a O
high O
tenor O
voice O
about O
the O
essential O
Christianity O
of O
the B-PER
poet I-PER
Shelley B-PER
filtering O
through O
the O
oak O
, O
he O
had O
moved O
on O
. O
Silence O
from O
behind O
another O
door O
farther O
down O
the B-FAC
passage I-FAC
encouraged O
him O
to O
place O
his O
fingers O
on O
the O
handle O
, O
but O
a O
crashing O
chord O
from O
an O
unseen O
piano O
made O
him O
remove O
them O
swiftly O
. O
He O
roamed O
on O
, O
and O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
the O
process O
of O
elimination O
had O
brought O
him O
to O
what O
was O
technically O
his B-FAC
own I-FAC
private I-FAC
library I-FAC
-- O
a O
large O
, O
soothing O
room O
full O
of O
old O
books O
, O
of O
which O
his B-PER
father I-PER
had O
been O
a O
great O
collector O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
did O
not O
read O
old O
books O
himself O
, O
but O
he O
liked O
to O
be O
among O
them O
, O
and O
it O
is O
proof O
of O
his O
pessimism O
that O
he O
had O
not O
tried O
the B-FAC
library I-FAC
first O
. O
To O
his O
depressed O
mind O
it O
had O
seemed O
hardly O
possible O
that O
there O
could O
be O
nobody B-PER
there B-FAC
. O
He O
stood O
outside O
the O
door O
, O
listening O
tensely O
. O
He O
could O
hear O
nothing O
. O
He O
went O
in O
, O
and O
for O
an O
instant O
experienced O
that O
ecstatic O
thrill O
which O
only O
comes O
to O
elderly O
gentlemen O
of O
solitary O
habit O
who O
in O
a O
house O
full O
of O
their B-PER
juniors I-PER
find O
themselves O
alone O
at O
last O
. O
Then O
a O
voice O
spoke O
, O
shattering O
his O
dream O
of O
solitude O
. O
" O
Hello O
, O
pop B-PER
! O
" O
Ogden B-PER
Ford I-PER
was O
sprawling O
in O
a O
deep O
chair O
in O
the O
shadows O
. O
" O
Come O
in O
, O
pop B-PER
, O
come O
in O
. O
Lots O
of O
room O
. O
" O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
stood O
in O
the O
doorway O
, O
regarding O
his B-PER
step-son I-PER
with O
a O
sombre O
eye O
. O
He O
resented O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
's O
tone O
of O
easy O
patronage O
, O
all O
the O
harder O
to O
endure O
with O
philosophic O
calm O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
the B-PER
latter I-PER
was O
lounging O
in O
his O
favourite O
chair O
. O
Even O
from O
an O
aesthetic O
point O
of O
view O
the O
sight O
of O
the B-PER
bulging I-PER
child I-PER
offended O
him O
. O
Ogden B-PER
Ford I-PER
was O
round O
and O
blobby O
and O
looked O
overfed O
. O
He O
had O
the O
plethoric O
habit O
of O
one O
to O
whom O
wholesome O
exercise O
is O
a O
stranger O
and O
the O
sallow O
complexion O
of O
the O
confirmed O
candy-fiend O
. O
Even O
now O
, O
a O
bare O
half O
hour O
after O
breakfast O
, O
his O
jaws O
were O
moving O
with O
a O
rhythmical O
, O
champing O
motion O
. O
" O
What O
are O
you O
eating O
, O
boy B-PER
? O
" O
demanded O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
, O
his O
disappointment O
turning O
to O
irritability O
. O
" O
Candy O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
not O
eat O
candy O
all O
day O
. O
" O
" O
Mother B-PER
gave O
it O
to O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Ogden B-PER
simply O
. O
As O
he O
had O
anticipated O
, O
the O
shot O
silenced O
the B-PER
enemy I-PER
's O
battery O
. O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
grunted O
, O
but O
made O
no O
verbal O
comment O
. O
Ogden B-PER
celebrated O
his O
victory O
by O
putting O
another O
piece O
of O
candy O
in O
his O
mouth O
. O
" O
Got O
a B-PER
grouch I-PER
this O
morning O
, O
have O
n't O
you O
, O
pop B-PER
? O
" O
" O
I O
will O
not O
be O
spoken O
to O
like O
that O
! O
" O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
had O

" O
said O
his B-PER
step-son I-PER
complacently O
. O
" O
I O
can O
always O
tell O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
you O
want O
to O

on O
me O
, O
though O

I O
've O
done O
nothing O

" O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
was O
sniffing O
suspiciously O
. O
" O
You O

been O
smoking O

" O
" O
Me O

Smoking O

There O

" O
No O
, O
sir B-PER
! O
I O
've O
only O
been O
here B-FAC
a O
few O
minutes O
. O
I O
guess O
one O
of O
the B-PER
fellows I-PER
was O
in O
here B-FAC
before O
me O
. O
They O
're O
always O
swiping O
your O
coffin-nails O
. O
You O
ought O
to O
do O
something O
about O
it O
, O
pop B-PER
. O
You O
ought O
to O
assert O
yourself O
. O
" O
A O
sense O
of O
helplessness O
came O
upon O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
. O
For O
the O
thousandth O
time O
he O
felt O
himself O
baffled O
by O
this B-PER
calm I-PER
, I-PER
goggle-eyed I-PER
boy I-PER
who I-PER
treated I-PER
him I-PER
with I-PER
such I-PER
supercilious I-PER
coolness I-PER
. O
" O
You O
ought O
to O
be O
out O
in O
the O
open O
air O
this O
lovely O
morning O

" O
he O
said O
feebly O
. O
" O
All O
right O

Let O

go O
for O
a O
walk O

I O
will O

you O
will O

" O
" O
I O
-- O
I O
have O
other O
things O
to O
do O

" O
said O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
, O
recoiling O
from O
the O
prospect O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
this O
fresh-air O
stuff O
is O
overrated O
anyway O
. O
Where O
's O
the O
sense O
of O
having O
a B-FAC
home I-FAC
if O
you O
do O
n't O
stop O
in O
it O
? O
" O
" O
When O
I O
was O
your O
age O

I O
would O
have O
been O
out O
on O
a O
morning O
like O
this O

" O
" O
And O
look O
at O
you O
now O

" O
" O
What O

you O

" O
" O
Martyr O

" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
a O
martyr O
to O
lumbago O

" O
said O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
, O
who O
was O
touchy O
on O
the O
subject O

" O
Have O
it O
your O

Ogden B-PER

further O

" O

if O
you O

There O

a O
draft O
from O
that O
door O
. O
" O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
retired O
, O
fermenting O
. O
He O
wondered O
how O
another B-PER
man I-PER
would O
have O
handled O
this O
situation O
. O
The O
ridiculous O
inconsistency O
of O
the O
human O
character O
infuriated O
him O
. O
Why O
should O
he O
be O
a B-PER
totally I-PER
different I-PER
man I-PER
on O
Riverside B-FAC
Drive I-FAC
from O
the B-PER
person I-PER
he I-PER
was I-PER
in O
Pine B-FAC
Street I-FAC
? O
Why O
should O
he O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
his O
own O
in O
Pine B-FAC
Street I-FAC
with O
grown B-PER
men I-PER
-- O
whiskered B-PER
, I-PER
square-jawed I-PER
financiers I-PER
-- O
and O
yet O
be O
unable O
on O
Riverside B-FAC
Drive I-FAC
to O
eject O
a B-PER
fourteen-year-old I-PER
boy I-PER
from O
an O
easy O
chair O
? O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
sometimes O
that O
a O
curious O
paralysis O
of O
the O
will O
came O
over O
him O
out O
of O
business O
hours O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
he O
had O
still O
to O
find O
a O
place O
where O
he O
could O
read O
his O
Sunday O
paper O
. O
He O
stood O
for O
a O
while O
in O
thought O
. O
Then O
his O
brow O
cleared O
, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
mount O
the B-FAC
stairs I-FAC
. O
Reaching O
the B-FAC
top I-FAC
floor I-FAC
, O
he O
walked O
along O
the B-FAC
passage I-FAC
and O
knocked O
on O
a O
door O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O
From O
behind O
this O
door O
, O
as O
from O
behind O
those O
below O
, O
sounds O
proceeded O
, O
but O
this O
time O
they O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
discourage O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
. O
It O
was O
the O
tapping O
of O
a O
typewriter O
that O
he O
heard O
, O
and O
he O
listened O
to O
it O
with O
an O
air O
of O
benevolent O
approval O
. O
He O
loved O
to O
hear O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
typewriter O
: O
it O
made O
home B-FAC
so O
like O
the B-FAC
office I-FAC
. O
" O
Come O
in O
, O
" O
called O
a B-PER
girl I-PER
's O
voice O
. O
The O
room O
in O
which O
Mr. B-PER
Pett O
found O
himself O
was O
small O
but O
cosy O
, O
and O
its O
cosiness O
-- O
oddly O
, O
considering O
the O
sex O
of O
its O
owner O
-- O
had O
that O
peculiar O
quality O
which O
belongs O
as O
a O
rule O
to O
the O
dens O
of O
men B-PER
. O
A O
large O
bookcase O
almost O
covered O
one O
side O
of O
it O
, O
its O
reds O
and O
blues O
and O
browns O
smiling O
cheerfully O
at O
whoever O
entered O

The O
walls O
were O
hung O
with O
prints O

judiciously O
chosen O

arranged O
. O
Through O
a O
window O
to O
the O
left O
, O
healthfully O
open O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
the O
sun O
streamed O
in O
, O
bringing O
with O
it O
the O
pleasantly O
subdued O
whirring O
of O
automobiles B-VEH
out O
on O
the B-FAC
Drive I-FAC

At O
a O

at O

window O

vivid O
red-gold O

rippling O
in O

from O
the B-LOC

sat O
the B-PER
girl I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
been I-PER
working I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
typewriter I-PER

She O
turned O

CHAPTER O
I O
In O
the O
days O
when O
the O
spinning-wheels O
hummed O
busily O
in O
the B-FAC
farmhouses I-FAC
-- O
and O
even O
great B-PER
ladies I-PER
, I-PER
clothed I-PER
in I-PER
silk I-PER
and I-PER
thread-lace I-PER
, O
had O
their O
toy O
spinning-wheels O
of O
polished O
oak O
-- O
there O
might O
be O
seen O
in O
districts O
far O
away O
among O
the B-FAC
lanes I-FAC
, O
or O
deep O
in O
the O
bosom O
of O
the B-LOC
hills I-LOC
, O
certain O
pallid O
undersized O
men O
, O
who O
, O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the B-PER
brawny I-PER
country-folk I-PER
, O
looked O
like O
the O
remnants O
of O
a B-PER
disinherited I-PER
race I-PER
. O
The B-PER
shepherd I-PER
's O
dog O
barked O
fiercely O
when O
one O
of O
these B-PER
alien-looking I-PER
men I-PER
appeared O
on O
the B-LOC
upland I-LOC
, O
dark O
against O
the O
early O
winter O
sunset O
; O
for O
what O
dog O
likes O
a B-PER
figure I-PER
bent I-PER
under I-PER
a I-PER
heavy I-PER
bag I-PER
? O
-- O
and O
these B-PER
pale I-PER
men I-PER
rarely O
stirred O
abroad O
without O
that O
mysterious O
burden O
. O
The B-PER
shepherd I-PER
himself O
, O
though O
he O
had O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
bag O
held O
nothing O
but O
flaxen O
thread O
, O
or O
else O
the O
long O
rolls O
of O
strong O
linen O
spun O
from O
that O
thread O
, O
was O
not O
quite O
sure O
that O
this O
trade O
of O
weaving O
, O
indispensable O
though O
it O
was O
, O
could O
be O
carried O
on O
entirely O
without O
the O
help O
of O
the B-PER
Evil I-PER
One I-PER
. O
In O
that O
far-off O
time O
superstition O
clung O
easily O
round O
every B-PER
person I-PER
or O
thing O
that O
was O
at O
all O
unwonted O
, O
or O
even O
intermittent O
and O
occasional O
merely O
, O
like O
the O
visits O
of O
the B-PER
pedlar I-PER
or O
the B-PER
knife-grinder I-PER
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
knew O
where O
wandering B-PER
men I-PER
had O
their B-FAC
homes I-FAC
or O
their O
origin O
; O
and O
how O
was O
a B-PER
man I-PER
to O
be O
explained O
unless O
you O
at O
least O
knew O
somebody O
who O
knew O
his B-PER
father I-PER
and O
mother B-PER
? O
To O
the B-PER
peasants I-PER
of I-PER
old I-PER
times I-PER
, O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
outside I-LOC
their I-LOC
own I-LOC
direct I-LOC
experience I-LOC
was O
a B-LOC
region I-LOC
of I-LOC
vagueness I-LOC
and I-LOC
mystery I-LOC
: O
to O
their O
untravelled O
thought O
a O
state O
of O
wandering O
was O
a O
conception O
as O
dim O
as O
the O
winter O
life O
of O
the O
swallows O
that O
came O
back O
with O
the O
spring O
; O
and O
even B-PER
a I-PER
settler I-PER
, O
if O
he O
came O
from O
distant B-LOC
parts I-LOC
, O
hardly O
ever O
ceased O
to O
be O
viewed O
with O
a O
remnant O
of O
distrust O
, O
which O
would O
have O
prevented O
any O
surprise O
if O
a O
long O
course O
of O
inoffensive O
conduct O
on O
his O
part O
had O
ended O
in O
the O
commission O
of O
a O
crime O
; O
especially O
if O
he O
had O
any O
reputation O
for O
knowledge O
, O
or O
showed O
any O
skill O
in O
handicraft O
. O
All O
cleverness O
, O
whether O
in O
the O
rapid O
use O
of O
that O
difficult O
instrument O
the O
tongue O
, O
or O
in O
some O
other O
art O
unfamiliar O
to O
villagers B-PER
, O
was O
in O
itself O
suspicious O
: O
honest B-PER
folk I-PER
, I-PER
born I-PER
and I-PER
bred I-PER
in I-PER
a I-PER
visible I-PER
manner I-PER
, O
were O
mostly O
not O
overwise O
or O
clever O
-- O
at O
least O
, O
not O
beyond O
such O
a O
matter O
as O
knowing O
the O
signs O
of O
the O
weather O
; O
and O
the O
process O
by O
which O
rapidity O
and O
dexterity O
of O
any O
kind O
were O
acquired O
was O
so O
wholly O
hidden O
, O
that O
they O
partook O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
conjuring O
. O
In O
this O
way O
it O
came O
to O
pass O
that O
those B-PER
scattered I-PER
linen-weavers I-PER
-- O
emigrants O
from O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
into O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
-- O
were O
to O
the B-PER
last I-PER
regarded O
as O
aliens B-PER
by O
their B-PER
rustic I-PER
neighbours I-PER
, O
and O
usually O
contracted O
the O
eccentric O
habits O
which O
belong O
to O
a O
state O
of O
loneliness O
. O
In O
the O
early O
years O
of O
this O
century O
, O
such B-PER
a I-PER
linen-weaver I-PER
, O
named O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
, O
worked O
at O
his O
vocation O
in O
a O
stone O

that O
stood O
among O
the B-LOC
nutty I-LOC
hedgerows I-LOC
near O
the B-GPE

Raveloe I-GPE
, O
and O
not O
far O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
a B-LOC
deserted I-LOC
stone-pit I-LOC
. O
The O
questionable O
sound O
of O
Silas B-PER
's O
loom O
, O
so O
unlike O
the O
natural O
cheerful O
trotting O
of O
the O
winnowing-machine O
, O
or O
the O
simpler O
rhythm O
of O
the O
flail O
, O
had O
a O
half-fearful O
fascination O
for O
the O
Raveloe O
boys O
, O
who O
would O
often O
leave O
off O
their O
nutting O
or O
birds O
' O
- O
nesting O
to O
peep O
in O
at O
the O
window O
of O
the B-FAC
stone I-FAC
cottage I-FAC
, O
counterbalancing O
a O
certain O
awe O
at O
the O
mysterious O
action O
of O
the O
loom O
, O
by O
a O
pleasant O
sense O
of O
scornful O
superiority O
, O
drawn O
from O
the O
mockery O
of O
its O
alternating O
noises O
, O
along O
with O
the O
bent O
, O
tread-mill O
attitude O
of O
the B-PER
weaver I-PER
. O
But O
sometimes O
it O
happened O
that O
Marner B-PER
, O
pausing O
to O
adjust O
an O
irregularity O
in O
his O
thread O
, O
became O
aware O
of O
the B-PER
small I-PER
scoundrels I-PER
, O
and O
, O
though O
chary O
of O
his O
time O
, O
he O
liked O
their O
intrusion O
so O
ill O
that O
he O
would O
descend O
from O
his O
loom O
, O
and O
, O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
would O
fix O
on O
them O
a O
gaze O
that O
was O
always O
enough O
to O
make O
them O
take O
to O
their O
legs O
in O
terror O
. O
For O
how O
was O
it O
possible O
to O
believe O
that O
those O
large O
brown O
protuberant O
eyes O
in O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
's O
pale O
face O
really O
saw O
nothing O
very O
distinctly O
that O
was O
not O
close O
to O
them O
, O
and O
not O
rather O
that O
their O
dreadful O
stare O
could O
dart O
cramp O
, O
or O
rickets O
, O
or O
a O
wry O
mouth O
at O
any B-PER
boy I-PER
who I-PER
happened I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
rear I-PER
? O
They O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
heard O
their B-PER
fathers I-PER
and O
mothers B-PER
hint O
that O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
could O
cure O
folks B-PER
' O
rheumatism O
if O
he O
had O
a O
mind O
, O
and O
add O
, O
still O
more O
darkly O
, O
that O
if O
you O
could O
only O
speak O
the B-PER
devil I-PER
fair O
enough O
, O
he O
might O
save O
you O
the O
cost O
of O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
. O
Such O
strange O
lingering O
echoes O
of O
the O
old O
demon-worship O
might O
perhaps O
even O
now O
be O
caught O
by O
the B-PER
diligent I-PER
listener I-PER
among O
the B-PER
grey-haired I-PER
peasantry I-PER
; O
for O
the O
rude O
mind O
with O
difficulty O
associates O
the O
ideas O
of O
power O
and O
benignity O
. O
A O
shadowy O
conception O
of O
power O
that O
by O
much O
persuasion O
can O
be O
induced O
to O
refrain O
from O
inflicting O
harm O
, O
is O
the O
shape O
most O
easily O
taken O
by O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
Invisible O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
men B-PER
who I-PER
have I-PER
always I-PER
been I-PER
pressed I-PER
close I-PER
by I-PER
primitive I-PER
wants I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
to I-PER
whom I-PER
a I-PER
life I-PER
of I-PER
hard I-PER
toil I-PER
has I-PER
never I-PER
been I-PER
illuminated I-PER
by I-PER
any I-PER
enthusiastic I-PER
religious I-PER
faith I-PER
. O
To O
them O
pain O
and O
mishap O
present O
a O
far O
wider O
range O
of O
possibilities O
than O
gladness O
and O
enjoyment O
: O
their O
imagination O
is O
almost O
barren O
of O
the O
images O
that O
feed O
desire O
and O
hope O
, O
but O
is O
all O
overgrown O
by O
recollections O
that O
are O
a O
perpetual O
pasture O
to O
fear O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
anything O
you O
can O
fancy O
that O
you O
would O
like O
to O
eat O
? O
" O
I O
once O
said O
to O
an O
old O
labouring O
man O
, O
who O
was O
in O
his O
last O
illness O
, O
and O
who O
had O
refused O
all O
the O
food O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
had O
offered O
him O
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
" O
I O
've O
never O
been O
used O
to O
nothing O
but O
common O
victual O
, O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
eat O
that O
. O
" O
Experience O
had O
bred O
no O
fancies O
in O
him O
that O
could O
raise O
the O
phantasm O
of O
appetite O
. O
And O
Raveloe B-GPE
was O
a B-GPE
village I-GPE
where I-GPE
many I-GPE
of I-GPE
the I-GPE
old I-GPE
echoes I-GPE
lingered I-GPE
, I-GPE
undrowned I-GPE
by I-GPE
new I-GPE
voices I-GPE
. O
Not O
that O
it O
was O
one O
of O
those B-FAC
barren I-FAC
parishes I-FAC
lying I-FAC
on I-FAC
the I-FAC
outskirts I-FAC
of I-FAC
civilization I-FAC
-- O
inhabited O
by O
meagre O
sheep O
and O
thinly-scattered B-PER
shepherds I-PER
: O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
lay O
in O
the O
rich O
central O
plain O
of O
what O
we O
are O
pleased O
to O
call O
Merry B-GPE
England I-GPE
, O
and O
held O
farms B-FAC
which I-FAC
, I-FAC
speaking I-FAC
from I-FAC
a I-FAC
spiritual I-FAC
point I-FAC
of I-FAC
view I-FAC
, I-FAC
paid I-FAC
highly-desirable I-FAC
tithes I-FAC
. O
But O
it O
was O
nestled O
in O
a O
snug O
well-wooded O
hollow O
, O
quite O
an O
hour O
's O
journey O
on O
horseback O
from O
any B-FAC
turnpike I-FAC
, O
where O
it O
was O
never O
reached O
by O
the O
vibrations O
of O
the O
coach-horn O
, O
or O
of O
public O
opinion O
. O
It O
was O
an O
important-looking O
village O
, O
with O
a B-FAC
fine I-FAC
old I-FAC
church I-FAC
and I-FAC
large I-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
in I-FAC
the I-FAC
heart I-FAC
of I-FAC
it I-FAC
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
large O
brick-and-stone O
homesteads O
, O
with O
well-walled B-FAC
orchards I-FAC
and O
ornamental O
weathercocks O
, O
standing O
close O
upon O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
, O
and O
lifting O
more O
imposing O
fronts O
than O
the O
rectory O
, O
which O
peeped O
from O
among O
the O
trees O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
: O
-- O
a O
village O
which O
showed O
at O
once O
the O
summits O
of O
its O
social O
life O
, O
and O
told O
the O
practised O
eye O
that O
there O
was O
no O
great B-FAC
park I-FAC
and O
manor-house B-FAC
in O
the B-LOC
vicinity I-LOC
, O
but O
that O
there O
were O
several O
chiefs O
in O
Raveloe B-GPE
who O
could O
farm O
badly O
quite O
at O
their O
ease O
, O
drawing O
enough O
money O
from O
their O
bad O
farming O
, O
in O
those O
war O
times O
, O
to O
live O
in O
a O
rollicking O
fashion O
, O
and O
keep O
a O
jolly O
Christmas O
, O
Whitsun O
, O
and O
Easter O
tide O
. O
It O
was O
fifteen O
years O
since O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
had O
first O
come O
to O
Raveloe B-GPE
; O
he O
was O
then O
simply O
a O
pallid O
young O
man O
, O
with O
prominent O
short-sighted O
brown O
eyes O
, O
whose O
appearance O
would O
have O
had O
nothing O
strange O
for O
people B-PER
of I-PER
average I-PER
culture I-PER
and I-PER
experience I-PER
, O
but O
for O
the B-PER
villagers I-PER
near I-PER
whom I-PER
he I-PER
had I-PER
come I-PER
to I-PER
settle I-PER
it O
had O
mysterious O
peculiarities O
which O
corresponded O
with O
the O
exceptional O
nature O
of O
his O
occupation O
, O
and O
his O
advent O
from O
an O
unknown O
region O
called O
" O
North B-LOC
' I-LOC
ard I-LOC
" O
. O
So O
had O
his O
way O
of O
life O
: O
-- O
he O
invited O
no B-PER
comer I-PER
to O
step O
across O
his O
door-sill O
, O
and O
he O
never O
strolled O
into O
the B-GPE
village I-GPE
to O
drink O
a O
pint O
at O
the B-FAC
Rainbow I-FAC
, O
or O
to O
gossip O
at O
the B-PER
wheelwright I-PER
's O
: O
he O
sought O
no B-PER
man I-PER
or O
woman B-PER
, O
save O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
his O
calling O
, O
or O
in O
order O
to O
supply O
himself O
with O
necessaries O
; O
and O
it O
was O
soon O
clear O
to O
the O
Raveloe B-GPE
lasses O
that O
he O
would O
never O
urge O
one O
of O
them O
to O
accept O
him O
against O
her O
will O
-- O
quite O
as O
if O
he O
had O
heard O
them O
declare O
that O
they O
would O
never O
marry O
a B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
come O
to O
life O
again O
. O
This O
view O
of O
Marner B-PER
's O
personality O
was O
not O
without O
another O
ground O
than O
his O
pale O
face O
and O
unexampled O
eyes O
; O
for O
Jem B-PER
Rodney I-PER
, O
the B-PER
mole-catcher I-PER
, O
averred O
that O
one O
evening O
as O
he O
was O
returning O
homeward O
, O
he O
saw O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
leaning O
against O
a O
stile O
with O
a O
heavy O
bag O
on O
his O
back O
, O
instead O
of O
resting O
the O
bag O
on O
the O
stile O
as O
a B-PER
man I-PER
in I-PER
his I-PER
senses I-PER
would O
have O
done O
; O
and O
that O
, O
on O
coming O
up O
to O
him O
, O
he O
saw O
that O
Marner B-PER
's O
eyes O
were O
set O
like O
a B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
's O
, O
and O
he O
spoke O
to O
him O
, O
and O
shook O
him O
, O
and O
his O
limbs O
were O
stiff O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
clutched O
the O
bag O
as O
if O
they O
'd O
been O
made O
of O
iron O
; O
but O
just O
as O
he O
had O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
that O
the B-PER
weaver I-PER
was O
dead O
, O
he O
came O
all O
right O
again O
, O
like O
, O
as O
you O
might O
say O
, O
in O
the O
winking O
of O
an O
eye O
, O
and O
said O
" O
Good-night O
" O
, O
and O
walked O
off O
. O
All O
this O
Jem B-PER
swore O
he O
had O
seen O
, O
more O
by O
token O
that O
it O
was O
the O
very O
day O
he O
had O
been O
mole-catching O
on O
Squire B-PER
Cass I-PER
's O
land O
, O
down O
by O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
saw-pit I-FAC
. O
Some O
said O
Marner B-PER
must O
have O
been O
in O
a O
" O
fit O
" O
, O
a O
word O
which O
seemed O
to O
explain O
things O
otherwise O
incredible O
; O
but O
the B-PER
argumentative I-PER
Mr. I-PER
Macey I-PER
, O
clerk O
of O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
, O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
and O
asked O
if O
anybody B-PER
was O
ever O
known O
to O
go O
off O
in O
a O
fit O
and O
not O
fall O
down O
. O
A O
fit O
was O
a O
stroke O
, O
was O
n't O
it O
? O
and O
it O
was O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
stroke O
to O
partly O
take O
away O
the O
use O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
's O
limbs O
and O
throw O
him O
on O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
, O
if O
he O
'd O
got O
no B-PER
children I-PER
to O
look O
to O
. O
No O
, O
no O
; O
it O
was O
no O
stroke O
that O
would O
let O
a B-PER
man I-PER
stand O
on O
his O
legs O
, O
like O
a O
horse O
between O
the O
shafts O
, O
and O
then O
walk O
off O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
say O
" O
Gee O
! O
" O
But O
there O
might O
be O
such O
a O
thing O
as O
a B-PER
man I-PER
's O
soul O
being O
loose O
from O
his O
body O
, O
and O
going O
out O
and O
in O
, O
like O
a O
bird O
out O
of O
its O
nest O
and O
back O
; O
and O
that O
was O
how O
folks B-PER
got O
over-wise O
, O
for O
they O
went O
to O
school B-FAC
in O
this O
shell-less O
state O
to O
those O
who O
could O
teach O
them O
more O
than O
their B-PER
neighbours I-PER
could O
learn O
with O
their O
five O
senses O
and O
the B-PER
parson I-PER
. O
And O
where O
did O
Master B-PER
Marner O
get O
his O
knowledge O
of O
herbs O
from O
-- O
and O
charms O
too O
, O
if O
he O
liked O
to O
give O
them O
away O
? O
Jem B-PER
Rodney I-PER
's O
story O
was O
no O
more O
than O
what O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
by O
anybody O
who O
had O
seen O
how O
Marner B-PER
had O
cured O
Sally B-PER
Oates I-PER
, O
and O
made O
her O
sleep O
like O
a B-PER
baby I-PER
, O
when O
her O
heart O
had O
been O
beating O
enough O
to O
burst O
her O
body O
, O
for O
two O
months O
and O
more O
, O
while O
she O
had O
been O
under O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
's O
care O
. O
He O
might O
cure O
more O
folks B-PER
if O
he O
would O
; O
but O
he O
was O
worth O
speaking O
fair O
, O
if O
it O
was O
only O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
doing O
you O
a O
mischief O
. O
THE B-PER
SISTERS I-PER
There O
was O
no O
hope O
for O
him O
this O
time O
: O
it O
was O
the O
third O
stroke O
. O
Night O
after O
night O
I O
had O
passed O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
( O
it O
was O
vacation O
time O
) O
and O
studied O
the O
lighted O
square O
of O
window O
: O
and O
night O
after O
night O
I O
had O
found O
it O
lighted O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
faintly O
and O
evenly O
. O
If O
he O
was O
dead O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
I O
would O
see O
the O
reflection O
of O
candles O
on O
the O
darkened O
blind O
for O
I O
knew O
that O
two O
candles O
must O
be O
set O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a B-PER
corpse I-PER
. O
He O
had O
often O
said O
to O
me O
: O
“ O
I O
am O
not O
long O
for O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
” O
and O
I O
had O
thought O
his O
words O
idle O
. O
Now O
I O
knew O
they O
were O
true O
. O
Every O
night O
as O
I O
gazed O
up O
at O
the O
window O
I O
said O
softly O
to O
myself O
the O
word O
paralysis O
. O
It O
had O
always O
sounded O
strangely O
in O
my O
ears O
, O
like O
the O
word O
gnomon O
in O
the O
Euclid B-PER
and O
the O
word O
simony O
in O
the O
Catechism O
. O
But O
now O
it O
sounded O
to O
me O
like O
the O
name O
of O
some B-PER
maleficent I-PER
and I-PER
sinful I-PER
being I-PER
. O
It O
filled O
me O
with O
fear O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
longed O
to O
be O
nearer O
to O
it O
and O
to O
look O
upon O
its O
deadly O
work O
. O
Old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
fire O
, O
smoking O
, O
when O
I O
came O
downstairs B-FAC
to O
supper O
. O
While O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
was O
ladling O
out O
my O
stirabout O
he O
said O
, O
as O
if O
returning O
to O
some O
former O
remark O
of O
his O
: O
“ O
No O
, O
I O
would O
n’t O
say O
he O
was O
exactly O
... O
but O
there O
was O
something O
queer O
... O
there O
was O
something O
uncanny O
about O
him O
. O
I O
’ll O
tell O
you O
my O
opinion O
.... O
” O
He O
began O
to O
puff O
at O
his O
pipe O
, O
no O
doubt O
arranging O
his O
opinion O
in O
his O
mind O
. O
Tiresome B-PER
old I-PER
fool I-PER
! O
When O
we O
knew O
him O
first O
he O
used O
to O
be O
rather O
interesting O
, O
talking O
of O
faints O
and O
worms O
; O
but O
I O
soon O
grew O
tired O
of O
him O
and O
his O
endless O
stories O
about O
the B-FAC
distillery I-FAC
. O
“ O
I O
have O
my O
own O
theory O
about O
it O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
it O
was O
one O
of O
those O
... O
peculiar O
cases O
... O
. O
But O
it O
’s O
hard O
to O
say O
.... O
” O
He O
began O
to O
puff O
again O
at O
his O
pipe O
without O
giving O
us O
his O
theory O
. O
My B-PER
uncle I-PER
saw O
me O
staring O
and O
said O
to O
me O
: O
“ O
Well O
, O
so O
your B-PER
old I-PER
friend I-PER
is O
gone O
, O
you O
’ll O
be O
sorry O
to O
hear O
. O
” O
“ O
Who O
? O
” O
said O
I. O
“ O
Father B-PER
Flynn O
. O
” O
“ O
Is O
he O
dead O
? O
” O
“ O
Mr B-PER
Cotter O
here O
has O
just O
told O
us O
. O
He O
was O
passing O
by O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
” O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
under O
observation O
so O
I O
continued O
eating O
as O
if O
the O
news O
had O
not O
interested O
me O
. O
My B-PER
uncle I-PER
explained O
to O
old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
. O
“ O
The B-PER
youngster I-PER
and O
he O
were O
great B-PER
friends I-PER
. O
The B-PER
old I-PER
chap I-PER
taught O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
mind O
you O
; O
and O
they O
say O
he O
had O
a O
great O
wish O
for O
him O
. O
” O
“ O
God B-PER
have O
mercy O
on O
his B-PER
soul I-PER
, O
” O
said O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
piously O
. O
Old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
looked O
at O
me O
for O
a O
while O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
his O
little O
beady O
black O
eyes O
were O
examining O
me O
but O
I O
would O
not O
satisfy O
him O
by O
looking O
up O
from O
my O
plate O
. O
He O
returned O
to O
his O
pipe O
and O
finally O
spat O
rudely O
into O
the O
grate O
. O
“ O
I O
would O
n’t O
like O
children B-PER
of I-PER
mine I-PER
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
to O
have O
too O
much O
to O
say O
to O
a B-PER
man I-PER
like I-PER
that I-PER
. O
” O
“ O
How O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
Mr B-PER
Cotter O
? O
” O
asked O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
. O
“ O
What O
I O
mean O
is O
, O
” O
said O
old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
, O
“ O
it O
’s O
bad O
for O
children B-PER
. O
My O
idea O
is O
: O
let O
a B-PER
young I-PER
lad I-PER
run O
about O
and O
play O
with O
young B-PER
lads I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
own I-PER
age I-PER
and O
not O
be O
... O
. O
Am O
I O
right O
, O
Jack B-PER
? O
” O
“ O
That O
’s O
my O
principle O
, O
too O
, O
” O
said O
my B-PER
uncle I-PER
. O
“ O
Let O
him O
learn O
to O
box O
his O
corner O
. O
That O
’s O
what O
I O
’m O
always O
saying O
to O
that B-PER
Rosicrucian I-PER
there I-PER
: O
take O
exercise O
. O
Why O
, O
when O
I O
was O
a B-PER
nipper I-PER
every O
morning O
of O
my O
life O
I O
had O
a O
cold O
bath O
, O
winter O
and O
summer O
. O
And O
that O
’s O
what O
stands O
to O
me O
now O
. O
Education O
is O
all O
very O
fine O
and O
large O
... O
. O
Mr B-PER
Cotter O
might O
take O
a O
pick O
of O
that O
leg O
mutton O
, O
” O
he O
added O
to O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
. O
“ O
No O
, O
no O
, O
not O
for O
me O
, O
” O
said O
old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
. O
My B-PER
aunt I-PER
brought O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
safe O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
table O
. O
“ O
But O
why O
do O
you O
think O
it O
’s O
not O
good O
for O
children B-PER
, O
Mr B-PER
Cotter O
? O
” O
she O
asked O
. O
“ O
It O
’s O
bad O
for O
children B-PER
, O
” O
said O
old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
, O
“ O
because O
their O
minds O
are O
so O
impressionable O
. O
When O
children B-PER
see O
things O
like O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
has O
an O
effect O
.... O
” O
I O
crammed O
my O
mouth O
with O
stirabout O
for O
fear O
I O
might O
give O
utterance O
to O
my O
anger O
. O
Tiresome B-PER
old I-PER
red-nosed I-PER
imbecile I-PER
! O
It O
was O
late O
when O
I O
fell O
asleep O
. O
Though O
I O
was O
angry O
with O
old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
for O
alluding O
to O
me O
as O
a B-PER
child I-PER
, O
I O
puzzled O
my O
head O
to O
extract O
meaning O
from O
his O
unfinished O
sentences O
. O
In O
the O
dark O
of O
my B-FAC
room I-FAC
I O
imagined O
that O
I O
saw O
again O
the O
heavy O
grey O
face O
of O
the B-PER
paralytic I-PER
. O
I O
drew O
the O
blankets O
over O
my O
head O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
Christmas O
. O
But O
the O
grey O
face O
still O
followed O
me O
. O
It O
murmured O
; O
and O
I O
understood O
that O
it O
desired O
to O
confess O
something O
. O
I O
felt O
my O
soul O
receding O
into O
some O
pleasant O
and O
vicious O
region O
; O
and O
there O
again O
I O
found O
it O
waiting O
for O
me O
. O
It O
began O
to O
confess O
to O
me O
in O
a O
murmuring O
voice O
and O
I O
wondered O
why O
it O
smiled O
continually O
and O
why O
the O
lips O
were O
so O
moist O
with O
spittle O
. O
But O
then O
I O
remembered O
that O
it O
had O
died O
of O
paralysis O
and O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
too O
was O
smiling O
feebly O
as O
if O
to O
absolve O
the B-PER
simoniac I-PER
of O
his O
sin O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
after O
breakfast O
I O
went O
down O
to O
look O
at O
the O
little O
house O
in O
Great B-FAC
Britain I-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O
It O
was O
an B-FAC
unassuming I-FAC
shop I-FAC
, I-FAC
registered I-FAC
under I-FAC
the I-FAC
vague I-FAC
name I-FAC
of I-FAC
Drapery I-FAC
. O
The O
drapery O
consisted O
mainly O
of O
children B-PER
’s O
bootees O
and O
umbrellas O
; O
and O
on O
ordinary O
days O
a O
notice O
used O
to O
hang O
in O
the O
window O
, O
saying O
: O
Umbrellas O
Re-covered O
. O
No O
notice O
was O
visible O
now O
for O
the O
shutters O
were O
up O
. O
A O
crape O
bouquet O
was O
tied O
to O
the O
door-knocker O
with O
ribbon O
. O
Two B-PER
poor I-PER
women I-PER
and O
a B-PER
telegram I-PER
boy I-PER
were O
reading O
the O
card O
pinned O
on O
the O
crape O
. O
I O
also O
approached O
and O
read O
: O
July O
1st O
, O
1895 O
The B-PER
Rev. I-PER
James B-PER
Flynn I-PER
( O
formerly O
of O
S. B-FAC
Catherine I-FAC
’s I-FAC
Church I-FAC
, O
Meath B-FAC
Street I-FAC
) O
, O
aged O
sixty-five O
years O
. O
R. O
I. O
P O
. O
The O
reading O
of O
the O
card O
persuaded O
me O
that O
he O
was O
dead O
and O
I O
was O
disturbed O
to O
find O
myself O
at O
check O
. O
Had O
he O
not O
been O
dead O
I O
would O
have O
gone O
into O
the O
little O
dark O
room O
behind O
the B-FAC
shop I-FAC
to O
find O
him O
sitting O
in O
his O
arm-chair O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
nearly O
smothered O
in O
his O
great-coat O
. O
Perhaps O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
would O
have O
given O
me O
a O
packet O
of O
High O
Toast O
for O
him O
and O
this O
present O
would O
have O
roused O
him O
from O
his O
stupefied O
doze O
. O
It O
was O
always O
I O
who O
emptied O
the O
packet O
into O
his O
black O
snuff-box O
for O
his O
hands O
trembled O
too O
much O
to O
allow O
him O
to O
do O
this O
without O
spilling O
half O
the O
snuff O
about O
the O
floor O
. O
Even O
as O
he O
raised O
his O
large O
trembling O
hand O
to O
his O
nose O
little O
clouds O
of O
smoke O
dribbled O
through O
his O
fingers O
over O
the O
front O
of O
his O
coat O
. O
It O
may O
have O
been O
these O
constant O
showers O
of O
snuff O
which O
gave O
his O
ancient O
priestly O
garments O
their O
green O
faded O
look O
for O
the O
red O
handkerchief O
, O
blackened O
, O
as O
it O
always O
was O
, O
with O
the O
snuff-stains O
of O
a O
week O
, O
with O
which O
he O
tried O
to O
brush O
away O
the O
fallen O
grains O
, O
was O
quite O
inefficacious O
. O
I O
wished O
to O
go O
in O
and O
look O
at O
him O
but O
I O
had O
not O
the O
courage O
to O
knock O
. O
I O
walked O
away O
slowly O
along O
the O
sunny O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
, O
reading O
all O
the O
theatrical O
advertisements O
in O
the O
shop-windows O
as O
I O
went O
. O
I O
found O
it O
strange O
that O
neither O
I O
nor O
the O
day O
seemed O
in O
a O
mourning O
mood O
and O
I O
felt O
even O
annoyed O
at O
discovering O
in O
myself O
a O
sensation O
of O
freedom O
as O
if O
I O
had O
been O
freed O
from O
something O
by O
his O
death O
. O
I O
wondered O
at O
this O
for O
, O
as O
my B-PER
uncle I-PER
had O
said O
the O
night O
before O
, O
he O
had O
taught O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
He O
had O
studied O
in O
the O
Irish O
college O
in O
Rome B-GPE
and O
he O
had O
taught O
me O
to O
pronounce O
Latin O
properly O
. O
He O
had O
told O
me O
stories O
about O
the B-FAC
catacombs I-FAC
and O
about O
Napoleon B-PER
Bonaparte I-PER
, O
and O
he O
had O
explained O
to O
me O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
different O
ceremonies O
of O
the O
Mass O
and O
of O
the O
different O
vestments O
worn O
by O
the B-PER
priest I-PER
. O
Sometimes O
he O
had O
amused O
himself O
by O
putting O
difficult O
questions O
to O
me O
, O
asking O
me O
what O
one O
should O
do O
in O
certain O
circumstances O
or O
whether O
such O
and O
such O
sins O
were O
mortal O
or O
venial O
or O
only O
imperfections O
. O
His O
questions O
showed O
me O
how O
complex O
and O
mysterious O
were O
certain O
institutions O
of O
the B-ORG
Church I-ORG
which O
I O
had O
always O
regarded O
as O
the O
simplest O
acts O
. O
The O
duties O
of O
the B-PER
priest I-PER
towards O
the O
Eucharist O
and O
towards O
the O
secrecy O
of O
the O
confessional O
seemed O
so O
grave O
to O
me O
that O
I O
wondered O
how O
anybody B-PER
had O
ever O
found O
in O
himself O
the O
courage O
to O
undertake O
them O
; O
and O
I O
was O
not O
surprised O
when O
he O
told O
me O
that O
the O
fathers O
of O
the B-ORG
Church I-ORG
had O
written O
books O
as O
thick O
as O
the B-ORG
Post I-ORG
Office I-ORG
Directory O
and O
as O
closely O
printed O
as O
the O
law O
notices O
in O
the O
newspaper O
, O
elucidating O
all O
these O
intricate O
questions O
. O
Often O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
this O
I O
could O
make O
no O
answer O
or O
only O
a O
very O
foolish O
and O
halting O
one O
upon O
which O
he O
used O
to O
smile O
and O
nod O
his O
head O
twice O
or O
thrice O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
used O
to O
put O
me O
through O
the O
responses O
of O
the O
Mass O
which O
he O
had O
made O
me O
learn O
by O
heart O
; O
and O
, O
as O
I O
pattered O
, O
he O
used O
to O
smile O
pensively O
and O
nod O
his O
head O
, O
now O
and O
then O
pushing O
huge O
pinches O
of O
snuff O
up O
each O
nostril O
alternately O
. O
When O
he O
smiled O
he O
used O
to O
uncover O
his O
big O
discoloured O
teeth O
and O
let O
his O
tongue O
lie O
upon O
his O
lower O
lip O
— O
a O
habit O
which O
had O
made O
me O
feel O
uneasy O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
before O
I O
knew O
him O
well O
. O
As O
I O
walked O
along O
in O
the O
sun O
I O
remembered O
old B-PER
Cotter I-PER
’s O
words O
and O
tried O
to O
remember O
what O
had O
happened O
afterwards O
in O
the O
dream O
. O
I O
remembered O
that O
I O
had O
noticed O
long O
velvet O
curtains O
and O
a O
swinging O
lamp O
of O
antique O
fashion O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
had O
been O
very O
far O
away O
, O
in O
some B-GPE
land I-GPE
where I-GPE
the I-GPE
customs I-GPE
were I-GPE
strange I-GPE
— O
in O
Persia B-GPE
, O
I O
thought O
... O
. O
But O
I O
could O
not O
remember O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dream O
. O
In O
the O
evening O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
took O
me O
with O
her O
to O
visit O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
of I-FAC
mourning I-FAC
. O
It O
was O
after O
sunset O
; O
but O
the O
window-panes O
of O
the B-FAC
houses I-FAC
that I-FAC
looked I-FAC
to I-FAC
the I-FAC
west I-FAC
reflected O
the O
tawny O
gold O
of O
a O
great O
bank O
of O
clouds O
. O
Nannie B-PER
received O
us O
in O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
; O
and O
, O
as O
it O
would O
have O
been O
unseemly O
to O
have O
shouted O
at O
her O
, O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
shook O
hands O
with O
her O
for O
all O
. O
The B-PER
old I-PER
woman I-PER
pointed O
upwards O
interrogatively O
and O
, O
on O
my B-PER
aunt I-PER
’s O
nodding O
, O
proceeded O
to O
toil O
up O
the B-FAC
narrow I-FAC
staircase I-FAC
before I-FAC
us I-FAC
, O
her O
bowed O
head O
being O
scarcely O
above O
the O
level O
of O
the O
banister-rail O
. O
At O
the B-FAC
first I-FAC
landing I-FAC
she O
stopped O
and O
beckoned O
us O
forward O
encouragingly O
towards O
the O
open O
door O
of O
the B-FAC
dead-room I-FAC
. O
My B-PER
aunt I-PER
went O
in O
and O
the B-PER
old I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
seeing O
that O
I O
hesitated O
to O
enter O
, O
began O
to O
beckon O
to O
me O
again O
repeatedly O
with O
her O
hand O
. O
— O

Stately O

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
came O
from O
the B-FAC
stairhead I-FAC
, O
bearing O
a O
bowl O
of O
lather O
on O
which O
a O
mirror O
and O
a O
razor O
lay O
crossed O
. O
A O
yellow O
dressinggown O
, O
ungirdled O
, O
was O
sustained O
gently O
behind O
him O
on O
the O
mild O
morning O
air O
. O
He O
held O
the O
bowl O
aloft O
and O
intoned O
: O
— O
Introibo O
ad O
altare O
Dei O
. O
Halted O
, O
he O
peered O
down O
the B-FAC
dark I-FAC
winding I-FAC
stairs I-FAC
and O
called O
out O
coarsely O
: O
— O
Come O
up O
, O
Kinch B-PER
! O
Come O
up O
, O
you B-PER
fearful I-PER
jesuit I-PER
! O
Solemnly O
he O
came O
forward O
and O
mounted O
the B-FAC
round I-FAC
gunrest I-FAC
. O
He O
faced O
about O
and O
blessed O
gravely O
thrice O
the B-FAC
tower I-FAC
, O
the B-LOC
surrounding I-LOC
land I-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
awaking I-LOC
mountains I-LOC
. O
Then O
, O
catching O
sight O
of O
Stephen B-PER
Dedalus I-PER
, O
he O
bent O
towards O
him O
and O
made O
rapid O
crosses O
in O
the O
air O
, O
gurgling O
in O
his O
throat O
and O
shaking O
his O
head O
. O
Stephen B-PER
Dedalus I-PER
, O
displeased O
and O
sleepy O
, O
leaned O
his O
arms O
on O
the B-FAC
top I-FAC
of I-FAC
the I-FAC
staircase I-FAC
and O
looked O
coldly O
at O
the O
shaking O
gurgling O
face O
that O
blessed O
him O
, O
equine O
in O
its O
length O
, O
and O
at O
the O
light O
untonsured O
hair O

grained O

hued O
like O
pale O

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
peeped O
an O
instant O
under O
the O
mirror O
and O
then O
covered O
the O
bowl O
smartly O
. O
— O
Back O
to O
barracks B-FAC

he O
said O
sternly O

He O
added O
in O

He O

up O

gave O
a O

slow O
whistle O
of O

, O
then O
paused O
awhile O
in O

attention O
, O
his O
even O
white O

He O

looked O
gravely O
at O
his B-PER
watcher I-PER
, O
gathering O
about O
his O

the O

of O
his O

The B-PER

A O

quietly O
over O

— O
The O

he O
said O

Your O

He O

to O

Stephen B-PER
Dedalus I-PER
stepped O
up O

him O
wearily O
halfway O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O

of O
the B-FAC

Buck B-PER

Mulligan B-PER

Stephen B-PER

with O

Out O

a B-PER

If O

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
frowned O
at O
the O
lather O
on O
his O
razorblade O
. O
He O
hopped O
down O
from O
his O
perch O
and O
began O
to O
search O
his O

pockets O
hastily O
. O
— O
Scutter O
! O
he O
cried O
thickly O
. O
He O
came O
over O
to O
the B-FAC
gunrest I-FAC
and O
, O
thrusting O
a O
hand O
into O
Stephen B-PER

Stephen B-PER

a O

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
wiped O
the O

neatly O
. O
Then O
, O
gazing O
over O
the O

, O
he O
said O
: O

He O
mounted O

again O
and O
gazed O
out O
over O
Dublin B-GPE

, O
his O

— O

Stephen B-PER
stood O
up O
and O
went O
over O
to O
the B-FAC

. O
Leaning O
on O
it O
he O
looked O
down O
on O
the B-LOC

on O
the B-VEH

clearing O
the O

of O
Kingstown B-GPE
. O
— O
Our B-LOC

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
said O
. O
He O
turned O
abruptly O
his O
grey O
searching O
eyes O
from O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
to O
Stephen B-PER
’s O
face O
. O
— O
The B-PER
aunt I-PER
thinks O
you O
killed O
your B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
he O
said O
. O
That O
’s O
why O
she O
wo O
n’t O
let O
me O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
you O
. O
— O
Someone O
killed O
her O
, O
Stephen B-PER
said O
gloomily O
. O
— O
You O
could O
have O
knelt O
down O
, O
damn O
it O
, O
Kinch O
, O
when O
your B-PER
dying I-PER
mother I-PER
asked O
you O
, O
Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
said O
. O
I O
’m O
hyperborean O
as O
much O
as O
you O
. O
But O
to O
think O
of O
your B-PER
mother I-PER
begging O
you O
with O
her O
last O
breath O
to O
kneel O
down O
and O
pray O
for O
her O
. O
And O
you O
refused O
. O
There O
is O
something O
sinister O
in O
you O
... O
. O
He O
broke O
off O
and O
lathered O
again O
lightly O
his O
farther O
cheek O
. O
A O
tolerant O
smile O
curled O
his O
lips O
. O
— O
But O
a B-PER
lovely I-PER

he O
murmured O
to O
himself O
. O
Kinch B-PER
, O
the B-PER
loveliest I-PER
mummer I-PER
of I-PER
them I-PER
all I-PER
! O
He O
shaved O
evenly O
and O
with O
care O
, O
in O
silence O
, O
seriously O
. O
Stephen B-PER
, O
an O
elbow O
rested O
on O
the O
jagged O
granite O
, O
leaned O
his O
palm O
against O
his O
brow O
and O
gazed O
at O
the O
fraying O
edge O
of O
his O
shiny O
black O
coat-sleeve O
. O
Pain O
, O
that O
was O
not O
yet O
the O
pain O
of O

, O
fretted O
his O
heart O
. O
Silently O
, O
in O
a O
dream O
she O
had O
come O
to O
him O
after O
her O
death O
, O
her O
wasted O
body O
within O
its O
loose O
brown O
graveclothes O
giving O
off O
an O

, O
her O

, O
that O

bent O
upon O
him O

Across O

he O
saw O

a I-LOC

by O
the B-PER

beside I-PER
him I-PER
. O
The B-LOC

of I-LOC

held O
a O
dull O

of O
liquid O

A O
bowl O
of O

had O
stood O
beside O
her O

holding O
the O
green O
sluggish O

which O
she O
had O
torn O
up O
from O
her O

by O

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
wiped O
again O

Stephen B-PER

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER

He O

He O

Stephen B-PER
turned O
his O

from O

to O
the B-PER

with I-PER
its I-PER

Stephen B-PER

Laughing O
again O
, O
he O
brought O
the O

away O
from O
Stephen B-PER

— O
The O

The O

Buck B-PER
Mulligan I-PER
suddenly O

what O

the O
one O
charm O
wanting O

-- O
Water O

not O
a O

Were O

a O

would O
you O
travel O
your O
thousand O

Why O
did O
the O
poor O
poet O
of O
Tennessee B-GPE
, O
upon O
suddenly O
receiving O
two O
handfuls O
of O
silver O

deliberate O
whether O
to O
buy O
him O
a O

which O
he O
sadly O
needed O
, O
or O
invest O
his O
money O
in O
a O
pedestrian O
trip O
to O
Rockaway B-LOC

? O
Why O
is O
almost B-PER
every I-PER
robust I-PER
healthy I-PER
boy I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
robust I-PER
healthy I-PER
soul I-PER
in I-PER
him I-PER
, O
at O
some O
time O
or O
other O
crazy O
to O
go O
to B-LOC
sea I-LOC
? O
Why O
upon O
your O
first O
voyage O
as O
a B-PER
passenger I-PER
, O
did O
you O
yourself O
feel O
such O
a O
mystical O
vibration O
, O
when O
first O
told O
that O
you O
and O
your B-VEH
ship I-VEH
were O
now O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land B-LOC
? O
Why O
did O
the B-PER
old I-PER
Persians I-PER
hold O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
holy O
? O
Why O
did O
the B-PER
Greeks I-PER
give O
it O
a B-PER
separate I-PER
deity I-PER
, O
and O
own O
brother O
of O
Jove B-PER
? O
Surely O
all O
this O
is O
not O
without O
meaning O
. O
And O
still O
deeper O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
story O
of O
Narcissus B-PER
, O
who O
because O
he O
could O
not O
grasp O
the O
tormenting O
, O
mild O
image O
he O
saw O
in O
the O
fountain O
, O
plunged O
into O
it O
and O
was O
drowned O
. O
But O
that O
same O
image O
, O
we O
ourselves O
see O
in O
all B-LOC
rivers I-LOC
and O
oceans B-LOC
. O
It O
is O
the O
image O
of O
the O
ungraspable O
phantom O
of O
life O
; O
and O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
it O
all O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
I O
say O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
going O
to O
sea B-LOC
whenever O
I O
begin O
to O
grow O
hazy O
about O
the O
eyes O
, O
and O
begin O
to O
be O
over O
conscious O
of O
my O
lungs O
, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
have O
it O
inferred O
that O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea B-LOC
as O
a B-PER
passenger I-PER
. O
For O
to O
go O
as O
a B-PER
passenger I-PER
you O
must O
needs O
have O
a O
purse O
, O
and O
a O
purse O
is O
but O
a O
rag O
unless O
you O
have O
something O
in O
it O
. O
Besides O
, O
passengers B-PER
get O
sea-sick O
-- O
grow O
quarrelsome O
-- O
do O
n't O
sleep O
of O
nights O
-- O
do O
not O
enjoy O
themselves O
much O

as O
a O
general O
thing O
; O
-- O
no O
, O
I O
never O
go O
as O
a B-PER
passenger I-PER
; O
nor O
, O
though O
I O
am O
something O
of O
a O
salt O
, O
do O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a B-PER
Commodore I-PER
, O
or O
a B-PER
Captain I-PER
, O
or O
a B-PER
Cook I-PER

I O
abandon O
the O
glory O
and O
distinction O
of O
such O
offices O
to O
those B-PER
who I-PER
like I-PER
them I-PER

For O
my O
part O

I O
abominate O
all O
honorable O
respectable O
toils O

trials O

and O
tribulations O
of O
every O
kind O
whatsoever O

It O
is O
quite O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
do O
to O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
, O
without O
taking O
care O
of O
ships B-VEH

barques B-VEH

and O
what O

And O
as O
for O
going O
as O
cook B-PER
, O
-- O
though O
I O
confess O
there O
is O
considerable O
glory O
in O
that O
, O
a B-PER
cook I-PER
being O
a B-PER
sort I-PER
of I-PER
officer I-PER
on I-PER
ship-board I-PER
-- O
yet O
, O
somehow O
, O
I O
never O
fancied O
broiling O
fowls O

-- O
though O
once O
broiled O
, O
judiciously O
buttered O

and O
judgmatically O

there O
is O
no B-PER

speak O
more O
respectfully O

not O
to O
say O
reverentially O
, O
of O
a O
broiled O
fowl O
than O
I O
will O
. O
It O
is O
out O
of O
the O
idolatrous O
dotings O
of O
the B-PER
old I-PER
Egyptians I-PER
upon O
broiled O
ibis O
and O
roasted O
river O
horse O
, O
that O
you O
see O
the O
mummies O
of O
those O
creatures O
in O
their B-FAC
huge I-FAC
bakehouses I-FAC
the I-FAC
pyramids I-FAC
. O
No O
, O
when O
I O
go O
to O
sea B-LOC
, O
I O
go O
as O
a B-PER
simple I-PER
sailor I-PER
, O
right O
before O
the O

, O
plumb O
down O
into O
the O
fore-castle O

aloft O
there O
to O
the O
royal O

True O
, O
they O
rather O
order O
me O
about O
some O
, O
and O
make O
me O
jump O
from O
spar O
to O
spar O
, O
like O
a O
grasshopper O
in O
a B-LOC
May I-LOC
meadow I-LOC
. O
And O
at O
first O
, O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
is O
unpleasant O
enough O
. O
It O
touches O
one O
's O
sense O
of O
honor O
, O
particularly O
if O
you O
come O
of O
an B-PER
old I-PER
established I-PER
family I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
land I-PER
, O
the B-PER
Van I-PER
Rensselaers I-PER
, O
or O
Randolphs B-PER
, O
or O
Hardicanutes B-PER
. O
And O
more O
than O
all O
, O
if O
just O
previous O
to O
putting O
your O
hand O
into O
the O
tar-pot O
, O
you O
have O
been O
lording O
it O
as O
a B-PER
country I-PER
schoolmaster I-PER
, O
making O
the B-PER
tallest I-PER
boys I-PER
stand O
in O
awe O
of O
you O
. O
The O
transition O
is O
a O
keen O
one O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
from O
a B-PER
schoolmaster I-PER
to O
a B-PER
sailor I-PER
, O
and O
requires O
a O
strong O
decoction O
of O
Seneca B-PER
and O
the B-PER
Stoics I-PER
to O
enable O
you O
to O
grin O
and O
bear O
it O
. O
But O
even O
this O
wears O
off O
in O
time O
. O
What O
of O
it O
, O
if O
some B-PER
old I-PER
hunks I-PER
of I-PER
a I-PER
sea-captain I-PER
orders O
me O
to O
get O
a O
broom O
and O
sweep O
down O
the O
decks O
? O
What O
does O
that O
indignity O
amount O
to O
, O
weighed O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
in O
the O
scales O
of O
the O
New O
Testament O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
the B-PER
archangel I-PER
Gabriel B-PER
thinks O
anything O
the O
less O
of O
me O
, O
because O
I O
promptly O
and O
respectfully O
obey O
that B-PER
old I-PER
hunks I-PER
in O
that O
particular O
instance O
? O
Who O
ai O
n't O
a B-PER
slave I-PER
? O
Tell O
me O
that O
. O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
however O
the B-PER
old I-PER
sea-captains I-PER
may O
order O
me O
about O
-- O
however O
they O
may O
thump O
and O
punch O
me O
about O
, O
I O
have O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
knowing O
that O
it O
is O
all O
right O
; O
that O
everybody B-PER
else I-PER
is O
one O
way O
or O
other O
served O
in O
much O
the O
same O
way O
-- O
either O
in O
a O
physical O
or O
metaphysical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
that O
is O
; O
and O
so O
the O
universal O
thump O
is O
passed O
round O
, O
and O
all O
hands O
should O
rub O
each O
other O
's O
shoulder-blades O
, O
and O
be O
content O
. O
Again O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea B-LOC
as O
a B-PER
sailor I-PER
, O
because O
they O
make O
a O
point O
of O
paying O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O
, O
whereas O
they O
never O
pay O
passengers B-PER
a O
single O
penny O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
passengers B-PER
themselves I-PER
must O
pay O
. O
And O
there O
is O
all O
the O
difference O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
between O
paying O
and O
being O
paid O
. O
The O
act O
of O
paying O
is O
perhaps O
the O
most O
uncomfortable O
infliction O
that O
the B-PER
two I-PER
orchard I-PER
thieves I-PER
entailed I-PER
upon I-PER
us I-PER
. O
But O
being O
paid O
, O
-- O
what O
will O
compare O
with O
it O
? O
The O
urbane O
activity O
with O
which O
a B-PER
man I-PER
receives O
money O
is O
really O
marvellous O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
so O
earnestly O
believe O
money O
to O
be O
the O
root O
of O
all O

and O
that O
on O
no O
account O
can O
a B-PER
monied I-PER
man I-PER
enter O
heaven B-FAC
. O
Ah O
! O
how O
cheerfully O
we O
consign O
ourselves O
to O
perdition O
! O
Finally O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea B-LOC
as O
a B-PER
sailor I-PER
, O
because O
of O
the O
wholesome O
exercise O
and O
pure O
air O
of O
the O
fore-castle O
deck O
. O
For O
as O
in O
this B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
head O
winds O
are O
far O
more O
prevalent O
than O
winds O
from O
astern O
( O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O
never O
violate O
the O
Pythagorean O
maxim O
) O
, O
so O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the B-PER
Commodore I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
quarter-deck I-PER
gets O
his O
atmosphere O
at O
second O
hand O
from O
the B-PER
sailors I-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
forecastle I-PER
. O
He O
thinks O
he O
breathes O
it O
first O
; O
but O
not O
so O
. O
In O
much O
the O
same O
way O
do O
the O
commonalty O
lead O
their B-PER
leaders I-PER
in O
many O
other O
things O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
the O
leaders O
little O
suspect O
it O
. O
But O
wherefore O
it O
was O
that O
after O
having O
repeatedly O
smelt O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
as O
a B-PER
merchant I-PER
sailor I-PER
, O
I O
should O
now O
take O
it O
into O
my O
head O
to O
go O
on O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
; O
this O
the B-PER
invisible I-PER
police I-PER
officer I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
Fates I-PER
, O
who O
has O
the O
constant O
surveillance O
of O
me O
, O
and O
secretly O
dogs O
me O
, O
and O
influences O
me O
in O
some O
unaccountable O
way O
-- O
he O
can O
better O
answer O
than O
any B-PER
one I-PER
else I-PER
. O
And O
, O
doubtless O
, O
my O
going O
on O
this O
whaling O
voyage O
, O
formed O
part O
of O
the O
grand O
programme O
of O
Providence O
that O
was O
drawn O
up O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O
It O
came O
in O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
brief O
interlude O
and O
solo O
between O
more O
extensive O
performances O
. O
I O
take O
it O
that O
this O
part O
of O
the O
bill O
must O
have O
run O
something O
like O
this O
: O
CHAPTER O
I O
At O
sunset O
hour O
the B-LOC
forest I-LOC
was O
still O
, O
lonely O
, O
sweet O
with O
tang O
of O
fir O

spruce O
, O
blazing O
in O
gold O
and O
red O
and O
green O
; O
and O
the B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
glided I-PER
on I-PER
under I-PER
the I-PER
great I-PER
trees I-PER
seemed O
to O
blend O
with O
the O
colors O
and O
, O
disappearing O
, O
to O
have O
become O
a O
part O
of O
the B-LOC
wild I-LOC
woodland I-LOC
. O
Old B-LOC
Baldy I-LOC
, O
highest O
of O
the B-PER
White I-PER
Mountains I-PER
, O
stood O
up O
round O
and O
bare O
, O
rimmed O
bright O
gold O
in O
the O
last O
glow O
of O
the O
setting O
sun O
. O
Then O
, O
as O
the O
fire O
dropped O
behind O
the O
domed O
peak O
, O
a O
change O
, O
a O
cold O
and O

, O
passed O
down O
the B-LOC
black I-LOC
spear-pointed I-LOC

over O
all B-LOC
that I-LOC

and O
the O

as O

as O
the O

of O
the B-PER
fierce I-PER
Apache I-PER
. O
September O
in O
that O
latitude O
was O
marked O
by O
the O
sudden O
cool O
night O
breeze O
following O
shortly O
after O
sundown O
. O
Twilight O
appeared O
to O
come O
on O
its O
wings O
, O
as O
did O
faint O
sounds O
, O
not O
distinguishable O
before O
in O
the O
stillness O
. O
Milt B-PER
Dale I-PER
, O
man O
of O
the B-LOC
forest I-LOC
, O
halted O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
a B-LOC
timbered I-LOC
ridge I-LOC
, O
to O
listen O
and O
to O
watch O
. O
Beneath O
him O
lay O
a B-LOC
narrow I-LOC
valley I-LOC
, I-LOC
open I-LOC
and I-LOC
grassy I-LOC
, I-LOC
from I-LOC
which I-LOC
rose I-LOC
a I-LOC
faint I-LOC
murmur I-LOC
of I-LOC
running I-LOC
water I-LOC
. O
Its O
music O
was O
pierced O
by O
the O
wild O
staccato O
yelp O
of O
a O
hunting O
coyote O
. O
From O
overhead O
in O
the O
giant O
fir O
came O
a O
twittering O
and O
rustling O
of O
grouse O
settling O
for O
the O
night O
; O
and O
from O
across O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
drifted O
the O
last O
low O
calls O
of O
wild O
turkeys O
going O
to O
roost O
. O
To O
Dale B-PER
's O
keen O
ear O
these O
sounds O
were O
all O
they O
should O
have O
been O
, O
betokening O
an O
unchanged O
serenity O
of O
forestland B-LOC
. O
He O
was O
glad O
, O
for O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
hear O
the O
clipclop O
of O
white B-PER
men I-PER
's O
horses O
-- O
which O
to O
hear O
up O
in O
those O
fastnesses O
was O
hateful O
to O
him O
. O
He O
and O
the B-PER
Indian I-PER
were O
friends B-PER
. O
That B-PER
fierce I-PER
foe I-PER
had O
no O
enmity O
toward O
the B-PER
lone I-PER
hunter I-PER
. O
But O
there O
hid O
somewhere O
in O
the B-LOC
forest I-LOC
a O
gang O
of O
bad B-PER
men I-PER
, O
sheep-thieves B-PER
, O
whom O
Dale B-PER
did O
not O
want O
to O
meet O
. O
As O
he O
started O
out O
upon O
the B-LOC
slope I-LOC
, O
a O
sudden O
flaring O
of O
the O
afterglow O
of O
sunset O
flooded O
down O
from O
Old B-PER
Baldy I-PER
, O
filling O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
with O
lights O
and O
shadows O
, O
yellow O
and O
blue O
, O
like O
the O
radiance O
of O
the O
sky O
. O
The O
pools O
in O
the O
curves O
of O
the B-LOC
brook I-LOC
shone O
darkly O
bright O
. O
Dale B-PER
's O
gaze O
swept O
up O
and O
down O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
, O
and O
then O
tried O
to O
pierce O
the O
black O
shadows O
across O
the B-LOC
brook I-LOC
where O
the O
wall O
of O
spruce O
stood O
up O
, O
its O
speared O
and O
spiked O
crest O
against O
the O
pale O
clouds O
. O
The O
wind O
began O
to O
moan O
in O
the O
trees O
and O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
of O
rain O
in O
the O
air O
. O
Dale B-PER
, O
striking O
a O
trail O
, O
turned O
his O
back O
to O
the O
fading O
afterglow O
and O
strode O
down O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
. O
With O
night O
at O
hand O
and O
a O
rain-storm O
brewing O
, O
he O
did O
not O
head O
for O
his B-FAC
own I-FAC
camp I-FAC
, O
some O
miles O
distant O
, O
but O
directed O
his O
steps O
toward O
an B-FAC
old I-FAC
log I-FAC
cabin I-FAC
. O
When O
he O
reached O
it O
darkness O
had O
almost O
set O
in O
. O
He O
approached O
with O
caution O
. O
This B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
, O
like O
the O
few O
others O
scattered O
in O
the B-LOC
valleys I-LOC
, O
might O
harbor O
Indians B-PER
or O
a O
bear O
or O
a O
panther O
. O
Nothing O
, O
however O
, O
appeared O
to O
be O
there B-FAC
. O
Then O
Dale B-PER
studied O
the O
clouds O
driving O
across O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
the O
cool O
dampness O
of O
a O
fine O
, O
misty O
rain O
on O
his O
face O
. O
It O
would O
rain O
off O
and O
on O
during O
the O
night O
. O
Whereupon O
he O
entered O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
. O
And O
the O
next O
moment O
he O
heard O
quick O
hoof-beats O
of O
trotting O
horses O
. O
Peering O
out O
, O
he O
saw O
dim B-PER
, I-PER
moving I-PER
forms I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
darkness I-PER
, I-PER
quite I-PER
close I-PER
at I-PER
hand I-PER
. O
They O
had O
approached O
against O
the O
wind O
so O
that O
sound O
had O
been O
deadened O
. O
Five O
horses O
with O
riders B-PER
, O
Dale B-PER
made O
out O
-- O
saw O
them O
loom O
close O
. O
Then O
he O
heard O
rough O
voices O
. O
Quickly O
he O
turned O
to O
feel O
in O
the O
dark O
for O
a O
ladder O
he O
knew O
led O
to O
a B-FAC
loft I-FAC
; O
and O
finding O
it O
, O
he O
quickly O
mounted O
, O
taking O
care O
not O
to O
make O
a O
noise O
with O
his O
rifle O
, O
and O
lay O
down O
upon O
the O
floor O
of O
brush O
and O
poles O
. O
Scarcely O
had O
he O
done O
so O
when O
heavy O
steps O
, O
with O
accompaniment O
of O
clinking O
spurs O
, O
passed O
through O
the O
door O
below O
into O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
. O
“ O
Wal B-PER
, O
Beasley B-PER
, O
are O
you O
here B-FAC
? O
” O
queried O
a O
loud O
voice O
. O
There O
was O
no O
reply O
. O
The B-PER
man I-PER
below O
growled O
under O
his O
breath O
, O
and O
again O
the O
spurs O
jingled O
. O
“ O
Fellars B-PER
, O
Beasley B-PER
ai O

, O
” O
he O
called O
. O
“ O

. O
We O
'll O
wait O
. O
” O
“ O
Wait O
, O

came O
a O
harsh O
reply O
. O
“ O
Mebbe O

” O
Low O
, O
muttered O
curses O
, O
then O
mingled O
with O
dull O
thuds O
of O
hoofs O
and O
strain O
of O
leather O
and O
heaves O
of O
tired O
horses O
. O
Another O
shuffling O
, O
clinking O
footstep O
entered O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
. O
“ O
Snake B-PER

drawled O
this B-PER

” O
Dale B-PER
, O
lying O
still O
and O
prone O
, O
felt O
a O
slow O
start O
in O
all O
his O
blood O
-- O
a O
thrilling O
wave O
. O
That B-PER
deep-voiced I-PER
man I-PER
below I-PER
was O
Snake B-PER
Anson I-PER
, O
the O
worst O
and O
most O
dangerous O
character O
of O
the B-LOC
region I-LOC
; O
and O
the O
others O
, O
undoubtedly O
, O
composed O
his B-PER
gang I-PER
, O
long O
notorious O
in O
that B-LOC
sparsely I-LOC
settled I-LOC
country I-LOC
. O
And O
the B-PER
Beasley I-PER
mentioned O
-- O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
two O
biggest O
ranchers O
and O
sheep-raisers O
of O
the B-PER
White I-PER
Mountain I-PER
ranges O
. O
What O
was O
the O
meaning O
of O
a O
rendezvous O
between O
Snake B-PER
Anson I-PER
and O
Beasley B-PER
? O
Milt B-PER
Dale I-PER
answered O
that O
question O
to O
Beasley B-PER
's O
discredit O
; O
and O
many O
strange O
matters O
pertaining O
to O
sheep O
and O
herders B-PER
, O
always O
a O
mystery O
to O
the B-GPE
little I-GPE
village I-GPE
of I-GPE
Pine I-GPE
, O
now O
became O
as O
clear O
as O
daylight O
. O
Other B-PER
men I-PER
entered O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
. O
“ O
It O
ai O
n't O

” O
said O
one O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
crash O
of O
wood O
thrown O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
“ O
Jim B-PER
, O
hyar O

” O
said O
another B-PER
. O
Rustlings O
and O
slow O
footsteps O
, O
and O
then O
heavy O
thuds O
attested O
to O
the O
probability O
that O
Jim B-PER
was O
knocking O
the O
end O
of O
a O
log O
upon O
the O
ground O
to O
split O
off O
a O
corner O
whereby O
a O
handful O
of O
dry O
splinters O
could O
be O
procured O
. O
“ O

“ O
Reckon O
you O

drawled O
Jim B-PER
. O
Sharp O
click O
of O
steel O
on O
flint O
-- O
many O
times O
-- O
and O
then O
a O
sound O
of O
hard O
blowing O
and O
sputtering O
told O
of O
Jim B-PER
's O
efforts O
to O
start O
a O
fire O
. O
Presently O
the O
pitchy O
blackness O
of O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
changed O
; O
there O
came O
a O
little O
crackling O
of O
wood O
and O
the O
rustle O
of O
flame O
, O
and O
then O
a O
steady O
growing O
roar O
. O
As O
it O
chanced O
, O
Dale B-PER
lay O
face O
down O
upon O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
loft O
, O
and O
right O
near O
his O
eyes O
there O
were O
cracks O
between O
the O
boughs O
. O
When O
the O
fire O
blazed O
up O
he O
was O
fairly O
well O
able O
to O
see O
the B-PER
men I-PER
below O
. O
The O
only O
one O
he O
had O
ever O
seen O
was O
Jim O
Wilson O
, O
who O
had O
been O
well O
known O
at O
Pine B-GPE
before O
Snake B-PER
Anson I-PER
had O
ever O
been O
heard O
of O
. O
Jim B-PER
was O
the O
best O
of O
a O
bad O
lot O
, O
and O
he O
had O
friends B-PER
among O
the B-PER
honest I-PER
people I-PER
. O
It O
was O
rumored O
that O
he O
and O
Snake B-PER
did O
not O
pull O
well O
together O
. O
“ O
Fire O
feels O
good O

” O
said O
the O
burly O
Moze B-PER
, O
who O
appeared O
as O
broad O
as O
he O
was O
black-visaged O
. O
“ O

spoke O
up O
another O

Moze B-PER
shuffled O
out O
with O
alacrity O
. O
In O
the O
firelight O
Snake B-PER
Anson I-PER
's O
face O
looked O
lean O
and O
serpent-like O
, O
his O
eyes O
glittered O
, O
and O
his O
long O
neck O
and O
all O
of O
his O
long O
length O
carried O
out O
the O
analogy O
of O
his O
name O
. O
“ O

inquired O

the B-PER

lips O
and O

somehow O

him O
apart O
from O
his B-PER

“ O

Burt B-PER

replied O
the O
man O
who O
had O
sent O
Moze B-PER
out O
. O
“ O

“ O

“ O

replied O
Snake B-PER
, O
gruffly O
. O
At O
the O
juncture O
Moze B-PER
returned O
. O
“ O
Boss B-PER
, O
I O
heerd O

he O
said O

Snake B-PER
rose O
and O
stood O
at O
the O
door O
, O
listening O
. O
Outside O
the O
wind O
moaned O
fitfully O
and O
scattering O
raindrops O
pattered O
upon O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC
. O
“ O
A-huh O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
Snake B-PER
, O
in O
relief O
. O
Silence O
ensued O
then O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
interval O
Dale B-PER
heard O
a O
rapid O
clip-clop O
on O
the B-FAC
rocky I-FAC
trail I-FAC
outside O
. O
The B-PER
men I-PER
below O
shuffled O
uneasily O
, O
but O
none O
of O
them O
spoke O
. O
The O
fire O
cracked O
cheerily O
. O
Snake B-PER
Anson I-PER
stepped O
back O
from O
before O
the O
door O
with O
an O
action O
that O
expressed O
both O
doubt O
and O
caution O
. O
The O
trotting O
horse O
had O
halted O
out O
there O
somewhere O
. O
“ O
Ho O
there O
, O
inside O
! O
” O
called O
a O
voice O
from O
the O
darkness O
. O
“ O
Ho O
yourself O
! O
” O
replied O
Anson B-PER
. O
“ O
That O
you O
, O
Snake B-PER
? O
” O
quickly O
followed O
the O
query O
. O
“ O
Reckon O
so O
, O
” O
returned O
Anson B-PER
, O
showing O
himself O
. O
The B-PER
newcomer I-PER
entered O
. O
He O
was O
a B-PER
large I-PER
man I-PER
, I-PER
wearing I-PER
a I-PER
slicker I-PER
that I-PER
shone I-PER
wet I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
firelight I-PER
. O
His O
sombrero O
, O
pulled O
well O
down O
, O
shadowed O
his O
face O
, O
so O
that O
the O
upper O
half O
of O
his O
features O
might O
as O
well O
have O
been O
masked O
. O
He O
had O
a O
black O
, O
drooping O
mustache O
, O
and O
a O
chin O
like O
a O
rock O
. O
A O
potential O
force O
, O
matured O
and O
powerful O
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
wrapped O
in O
his O
movements O
. O
“ O
Hullo O
, O
Snake B-PER
! O
Hullo O
, O
Wilson B-PER
! O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O

Here O
he O
indicated O
with O
a O
significant O
gesture O
that O
Snake B-PER

were O
to O
leave O
the B-FAC
cabin I-FAC

“ O
A-huh O

Anson B-PER
, O
dubiously O
. O
Then O
he O
turned O
abruptly O

Book O
First O
I O
Strether B-PER
's O
first O
question O
, O
when O
he O
reached O
the B-FAC
hotel I-FAC
, O
was O
about O
his O
friend O
; O
yet O
on O
his O
learning O
that O
Waymarsh B-PER
was O
apparently O
not O
to O
arrive O
till O
evening O
he O
was O
not O
wholly O
disconcerted O
. O
A O
telegram O
from O
him O
bespeaking O
a B-FAC
room I-FAC
" O
only O
if O
not O
noisy O
, O
" O
reply O
paid O
, O
was O
produced O
for O
the B-PER
enquirer I-PER
at O
the B-FAC
office I-FAC
, O
so O
that O
the O
understanding O
they O
should O
meet O
at O
Chester B-GPE
rather O
than O
at O
Liverpool B-GPE
remained O
to O
that O
extent O
sound O
. O
The O
same O
secret O
principle O
, O
however O
, O
that O
had O
prompted O
Strether B-PER
not O
absolutely O
to O
desire O
Waymarsh B-PER
's O
presence O
at O
the B-FAC
dock I-FAC
, O
that O
had O
led O
him O
thus O
to O
postpone O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
his O
enjoyment O
of O
it O
, O
now O
operated O
to O
make O
him O
feel O
he O
could O
still O
wait O
without O
disappointment O
. O
They O
would O
dine O
together O
at O
the O
worst O
, O
and O
, O
with O
all O
respect O
to O
dear O
old O
Waymarsh B-PER
-- O
if O
not O
even O
, O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
to O
himself O
-- O
there O
was O
little O
fear O
that O
in O
the O
sequel O
they O
should O
n't O
see O
enough O
of O
each O
other O
. O
The O
principle O
I O
have O
just O
mentioned O
as O
operating O
had O
been O
, O
with O
the O
most O
newly O
disembarked O
of O
the B-PER
two I-PER
men I-PER
, O
wholly O
instinctive O
-- O
the O
fruit O
of O
a O
sharp O
sense O
that O
, O
delightful O
as O
it O
would O
be O
to O
find O
himself O
looking O
, O
after O
so O
much O
separation O
, O
into O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
's O
face O
, O
his O
business O
would O
be O
a O
trifle O
bungled O
should O
he O
simply O
arrange O
for O
this O
countenance O
to O
present O
itself O
to O
the B-VEH
nearing I-VEH
steamer I-VEH
as O
the O
first O
" O
note O
, O
" O
of O
Europe B-GPE
. O
Mixed O
with O
everything O
was O
the O
apprehension O
, O
already O
, O
on O
Strether B-PER
's O
part O
, O
that O
it O
would O
, O
at O
best O
, O
throughout O
, O
prove O
the O
note O
of O
Europe B-GPE
in O
quite O
a O
sufficient O
degree O
. O
That O
note O
had O
been O
meanwhile O
-- O
since O
the O
previous O
afternoon O
, O
thanks O
to O
this O
happier O
device O
-- O
such O
a O
consciousness O
of O
personal O
freedom O
as O
he O
had O
n't O
known O
for O
years O
; O
such O
a O
deep O
taste O
of O
change O
and O
of O
having O
above O
all O
for O
the O
moment O
nobody B-PER
and O
nothing O
to O
consider O
, O
as O
promised O
already O
, O
if O
headlong O
hope O
were O
not O
too O
foolish O
, O
to O
colour O
his O
adventure O
with O
cool O
success O
. O
There O
were O
people O
on O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
with O
whom O
he O
had O
easily O
consorted O
-- O
so O
far O
as O
ease O
could O
up O
to O
now O
be O
imputed O
to O
him O
-- O
and O
who O
for O
the O
most O
part O
plunged O
straight O
into O
the O
current O
that O
set O
from O
the B-FAC
landing-stage I-FAC
to O
London B-GPE
; O
there O
were O
others O
who O
had O
invited O
him O
to O
a O
tryst O
at O
the B-FAC
inn I-FAC
and O
had O
even O
invoked O
his O
aid O
for O
a O
" O
look O
round O
" O
at O
the O
beauties O
of O
Liverpool B-GPE
; O
but O
he O
had O
stolen O
away O
from O
every B-PER
one I-PER
alike O
, O
had O
kept O
no O
appointment O
and O
renewed O
no O
acquaintance O
, O
had O
been O
indifferently O
aware O
of O
the O
number O
of O
persons B-PER
who I-PER
esteemed I-PER
themselves I-PER
fortunate I-PER
in I-PER
being I-PER
, I-PER
unlike I-PER
himself I-PER
, I-PER
" I-PER
met I-PER
, I-PER
" I-PER
and O
had O
even O
independently O
, O
unsociably O
, O
alone O
, O
without O
encounter O
or O
relapse O
and O
by O
mere O
quiet O
evasion O
, O
given O
his O
afternoon O
and O
evening O
to O
the O
immediate O
and O
the O
sensible O
. O
They O
formed O
a O
qualified O
draught O
of O
Europe B-GPE
, O
an O
afternoon O
and O
an O
evening O
on O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Mersey B-LOC
, O
but O
such O
as O
it O
was O
he O
took O
his O
potion O
at O
least O
undiluted O
. O
He O
winced O
a O
little O
, O
truly O
, O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
Waymarsh B-PER
might O
be O
already O
at O
Chester B-GPE
; O
he O
reflected O
that O
, O
should O
he O
have O
to O
describe O
himself O
there O
as O
having O
" O
got O
in O
" O
so O
early O
, O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
make O
the O
interval O
look O
particularly O
eager O
; O
but O
he O
was O
like O
a B-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
, I-PER
elatedly I-PER
finding I-PER
in I-PER
his I-PER
pocket I-PER
more I-PER
money I-PER
than I-PER
usual I-PER
, I-PER
handles I-PER
it I-PER
a I-PER
while I-PER
and I-PER
idly I-PER
and I-PER
pleasantly I-PER
chinks I-PER
it I-PER
before I-PER
addressing I-PER
himself I-PER
to I-PER
the I-PER
business I-PER
of I-PER
spending I-PER
. O
That O
he O
was O
prepared O
to O
be O
vague O
to O
Waymarsh B-PER
about O
the O
hour O
of O
the B-VEH
ship I-VEH
's O
touching O
, O
and O
that O
he O
both O
wanted O
extremely O
to O
see O
him O
and O
enjoyed O
extremely O
the O
duration O
of O
delay O
-- O
these O
things O
, O
it O
is O
to O
be O
conceived O
, O
were O
early O
signs O
in O
him O
that O
his O
relation O
to O
his O
actual O
errand O
might O
prove O
none O
of O
the O
simplest O
. O
He O
was O
burdened O
, O
poor O
Strether B-PER
-- O
it O
had O
better O
be O
confessed O
at O
the O
outset O
-- O
with O
the O
oddity O
of O
a O
double O
consciousness O
. O
There O
was O
detachment O
in O
his O
zeal O
and O
curiosity O
in O
his O
indifference O
. O
After O
the B-PER
young I-PER
woman I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
glass I-PER
cage I-PER
had O
held O
up O
to O
him O
across O
her O
counter O
the O
pale-pink O
leaflet O
bearing O
his B-PER
friend I-PER
's O
name O
, O
which O
she O
neatly O
pronounced O
, O
he O
turned O
away O
to O
find O
himself O
, O
in O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
, O
facing O
a B-PER
lady I-PER
who I-PER
met I-PER
his I-PER
eyes I-PER
as I-PER
with I-PER
an I-PER
intention I-PER
suddenly I-PER
determined I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
whose I-PER
features I-PER
-- I-PER
not I-PER
freshly I-PER
young I-PER
, I-PER
not I-PER
markedly I-PER
fine I-PER
, I-PER
but I-PER
on I-PER
happy I-PER
terms I-PER
with I-PER
each I-PER
other I-PER
-- I-PER
came I-PER
back I-PER
to I-PER
him I-PER
as I-PER
from I-PER
a I-PER
recent I-PER
vision I-PER
. O
For O
a O
moment O
they O
stood O
confronted O
; O
then O
the O
moment O
placed O
her O
: O
he O
had O
noticed O
her O
the O
day O
before O
, O
noticed O
her O
at O
his B-FAC
previous I-FAC
inn I-FAC
, O
where O
-- O
again O
in O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
-- O
she O
had O
been O
briefly O
engaged O
with O
some O
people O
of O
his B-VEH
own I-VEH
ship I-VEH
's O
company O
. O
Nothing O
had O
actually O
passed O
between O
them O
, O
and O
he O
would O
as O
little O
have O
been O
able O
to O
say O
what O
had O
been O
the O
sign O
of O
her O
face O
for O
him O
on O
the O
first O
occasion O
as O
to O
name O
the O
ground O
of O
his O
present O
recognition O
. O
Recognition O
at O
any O
rate O
appeared O
to O
prevail O
on O
her O
own O
side O
as O
well O
-- O
which O
would O
only O
have O
added O
to O
the O
mystery O
. O
All O
she O
now O
began O
by O
saying O
to O
him O
nevertheless O
was O
that O
, O
having O
chanced O
to O
catch O
his O
enquiry O
, O
she O
was O
moved O
to O
ask O
, O
by O
his O
leave O
, O
if O
it O
were O
possibly O
a O
question O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Waymarsh O
of O
Milrose B-GPE
Connecticut B-GPE
-- O
Mr. B-PER
Waymarsh O
the B-PER
American I-PER
lawyer I-PER
. O
" O
Oh O
yes O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
my B-PER
very I-PER
well-known I-PER
friend I-PER
. O
He O
's O
to O
meet O
me O
here O
, O
coming O
up O
from O
Malvern B-GPE
, O
and O
I O
supposed O
he O
'd O
already O
have O
arrived O
. O
But O
he O
does O
n't O
come O
till O
later O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
relieved O
not O
to O
have O
kept O
him O
. O
Do O
you O
know O
him O
? O
" O
Strether B-PER
wound O
up O
. O
It O
was O
n't O
till O
after O
he O
had O
spoken O
that O
he O
became O
aware O
of O
how O
much O
there O
had O
been O
in O
him O
of O
response O
; O
when O
the O
tone O
of O
her O
own O
rejoinder O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
play O
of O
something O
more O
in O
her O
face O
-- O
something O
more O
, O
that O
is O
, O
than O
its O
apparently O
usual O
restless O
light O
-- O
seemed O
to O
notify O
him O
. O
" O
I O
've O
met O
him O
at O
Milrose B-GPE
-- O
where O
I O
used O
sometimes O
, O
a O
good O
while O
ago O
, O
to O
stay O
; O
I O
had O
friends O
there B-GPE
who O
were O
friends B-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
at O
his B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
I O
wo O
n't O
answer O
for O
it O
that O
he O
would O
know O
me O
, O
" O
Strether B-PER
's O
new O
acquaintance O
pursued O
; O
" O
but O
I O
should O
be O
delighted O
to O
see O
him O
. O
Perhaps O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
-- O
for O
I O
'm O
staying O
over O
. O
" O
She O
paused O
while O
our B-PER
friend I-PER
took O
in O
these O
things O
, O
and O
it O
was O
as O
if O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
talk O
had O
already O
passed O
. O
They O
even O
vaguely O
smiled O
at O
it O
, O
and O
Strether B-PER
presently O
observed O
that O
Mr. B-PER
Waymarsh O
would O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
be O
easily O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
This O
, O
however O
, O
appeared O
to O
affect O
the B-PER
lady I-PER
as O
if O
she O
might O
have O
advanced O
too O
far O
. O
She O
appeared O
to O
have O
no O
reserves O
about O
anything O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
he O
wo O
n't O
care O
! O
" O
-- O
and O
she O
immediately O
thereupon O
remarked O
that O
she O
believed O
Strether B-PER
knew O
the B-PER
Munsters I-PER
; O
the B-PER
Munsters I-PER
being O
the O
people O
he O
had O
seen O
her O
with O
at O
Liverpool B-GPE
. O
But O
he O
did O
n't O
, O
it O
happened O
, O
know O
the B-PER
Munsters I-PER
well O
enough O
to O
give O
the O
case O
much O
of O
a O
lift O
; O
so O
that O
they O
were O
left O
together O
as O
if O
over O
the O
mere O
laid O
table O
of O
conversation O
. O
Her O
qualification O
of O
the O
mentioned O
connexion O
had O
rather O
removed O
than O
placed O
a O
dish O
, O
and O
there O
seemed O
nothing O
else O
to O
serve O
. O
Their O
attitude O
remained O
, O
none O
the O
less O
, O
that O
of O
not O
forsaking O
the O
board O
; O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
in O
turn O
was O
to O
give O
them O
the O
appearance O
of O
having O
accepted O
each O
other O
with O
an O
absence O
of O
preliminaries O
practically O
complete O
. O
They O
moved O
along O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
together O
, O
and O
Strether B-PER
's O
companion O
threw O
off O
that O
the B-FAC
hotel I-FAC
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
a B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
He O
was O
aware O
by O
this O
time O
of O
his O
strange O
inconsequence O
: O
he O
had O
shirked O
the O
intimacies O
of O
the B-VEH
steamer I-VEH
and O
had O
muffled O
the O
shock O
of O
Waymarsh B-PER
only O
to O
find O
himself O
forsaken O
, O
in O
this O
sudden O
case O
, O
both O
of O
avoidance O
and O
of O
caution O
. O
He O
passed O
, O
under O
this O
unsought O
protection O
and O
before O
he O
had O
so O
much O
as O
gone O
up O
to O
his B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
into O
the O
garden O
of O
the B-FAC
hotel I-FAC
, O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
ten O
minutes O
had O
agreed O
to O
meet O
there B-FAC
again O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
should O
have O
made O
himself O
tidy O
, O
the B-PER
dispenser I-PER
of I-PER
such I-PER
good I-PER
assurances I-PER
. O
He O
wanted O
to O
look O
at O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
, O
and O
they O
would O
forthwith O
look O
together O
. O
It O
was O
almost O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
in O
possession O
and O
received O
him O
as O
a B-PER
guest I-PER
. O
Her O
acquaintance O
with O
the B-FAC
place I-FAC
presented O
her O
in O
a O
manner O
as O
a B-PER
hostess I-PER
, O
and O
Strether B-PER
had O
a O
rueful O
glance O
for O
the B-PER
lady I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
glass I-PER
cage I-PER
. O
It O
was O
as O
if O
this B-PER
personage I-PER
had O
seen O
herself O
instantly O
superseded O
. O
When O
in O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
he O
came O
down O
, O
what O
his B-PER
hostess I-PER
saw O
, O
what O
she O
might O
have O
taken O
in O
with O
a O
vision O
kindly O
adjusted O
, O
was O
the O
lean O
, O
the O
slightly O
loose O
figure O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
middle I-PER
height I-PER
and I-PER
something I-PER
more I-PER
perhaps I-PER
than I-PER
the I-PER
middle I-PER
age I-PER
-- O
a B-PER
man I-PER
of I-PER
five-and-fifty I-PER
, I-PER
whose I-PER
most I-PER
immediate I-PER
signs I-PER
were I-PER
a I-PER
marked I-PER
bloodless I-PER
brownness I-PER
of I-PER
face I-PER
, I-PER
a I-PER
thick I-PER
dark I-PER
moustache I-PER

of I-PER
characteristically I-PER
American I-PER
cut I-PER
, I-PER
growing I-PER
strong I-PER
and I-PER
falling I-PER
low I-PER
, I-PER
a I-PER
head I-PER
of I-PER
hair I-PER
still I-PER
abundant I-PER
but I-PER
irregularly I-PER
streaked I-PER
with I-PER
grey I-PER

bold I-PER

as I-PER
it I-PER
might I-PER
have I-PER
been I-PER
called I-PER

of I-PER
which I-PER
, I-PER
had I-PER
a I-PER
certain I-PER
effect I-PER
of I-PER
mitigation I-PER
. O
A O
perpetual O
pair O
of O
glasses O
astride O
of O
this O
fine O
ridge O
, O
and O
a O
line O
, O
unusually O
deep O
and O
drawn O
, O
the O
prolonged O
pen-stroke O
of O
time O
, O
accompanying O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
moustache O
from O
nostril O
to O
chin O
, O
did O
something O
to O
complete O
the O
facial O
furniture O
that O
an B-PER
attentive I-PER
observer I-PER
would O
have O
seen O
catalogued O
, O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
in O
the O
vision O
of O
the O
other O
party O
to O
Strether B-PER
's O
appointment O
. O
She O
waited O
for O
him O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
, O
the O
other O
party O
, O
drawing O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
singularly O
fresh O
soft O
and O
elastic O
light O
gloves O
and O
presenting O
herself O
with O
a O
superficial O
readiness O
which O
, O
as O
he O
approached O
her O
over O
the B-FAC
small I-FAC
smooth I-FAC
lawn I-FAC
and O
in O
the O
watery O
English O
sunshine O
, O
he O
might O
, O
with O
his O
rougher O
preparation O
, O
have O
marked O
as O
the O
model O
for O
such O
an O
occasion O
. O
She O
had O
, O
this B-PER
lady I-PER
, O
a O
perfect O
plain O
propriety O
, O
an O
expensive O
subdued O
suitability O
, O
that O
her B-PER
companion I-PER
was O
not O
free O
to O
analyse O
, O
but O
that O
struck O
him O
, O
so O
that O
his O
consciousness O
of O
it O
was O
instantly O
acute O
, O
as O
a O
quality O
quite O
new O
to O
him O
. O
Before O
reaching O
her O
he O
stopped O
on O
the O
grass O
and O
went O
through O
the O
form O
of O
feeling O
for O
something O
, O
possibly O
forgotten O
, O
in O
the O
light O
overcoat O
he O
carried O
on O
his O
arm O
; O
yet O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
act O
was O
no O
more O
than O
the O
impulse O
to O
gain O
time O
. O
Nothing O
could O
have O
been O
odder O
than O
Strether B-PER
's O
sense O
of O
himself O
as O
at O
that O
moment O
launched O
in O
something O
of O
which O
the O
sense O
would O
be O
quite O
disconnected O
from O
the O
sense O
of O
his O
past O
and O
which O
was O
literally O
beginning O
there O
and O
then O
. O
It O
had O
begun O
in O
fact O
already O
upstairs B-FAC
and O
before O
the O
dressing O
glass O
that O
struck O
him O
as O
blocking O
further O
, O
so O
strangely O
, O
the O
dimness O
of O
the O
window O
of O
his B-FAC
dull I-FAC
bedroom I-FAC
; O
begun O
with O
a O
sharper O
survey O
of O
the O
elements O
of O
Appearance O
than O
he O
had O
for O
a O
long O
time O
been O
moved O
to O
make O
. O
He O
had O
during O
those O
moments O
felt O
these O
elements O
to O
be O
not O
so O
much O
to O
his O
hand O
as O
he O
should O
have O
liked O
, O
and O
then O
had O
fallen O
back O
on O
the O
thought O
that O
they O
were O
precisely O
a O
matter O
as O
to O
which O
help O
was O
supposed O
to O
come O
from O
what O
he O
was O
about O
to O
do O
. O
He O
was O
about O
to O
go O
up O
to O
London B-GPE
, O
so O
that O
hat O
and O
necktie O
might O
wait O
. O
What O
had O
come O
as O
straight O
to O
him O
as O
a O
ball O
in O
a O
well-played O
game O
-- O
and O
caught O
moreover O
not O
less O
neatly O
-- O
was O
just O
the O
air O
, O
in O
the B-PER
person I-PER
of I-PER
his I-PER
friend I-PER
, O
of O
having O
seen O
and O
chosen O
, O
the O
air O
of O
achieved O
possession O
of O
those O
vague O
qualities O
and O
quantities O
that O
collectively O
figured O
to O
him O
as O
the O
advantage O
snatched O
from O
lucky O
chances O
. O
Without O
pomp O
or O
circumstance O
, O
certainly O
, O
as O
her O
original O
address O
to O
him O
, O
equally O
with O
his O
own O
response O
, O
had O
been O
, O
he O
would O
have O
sketched O
to O
himself O
his O
impression O
of O
her O
as O
: O
" O
Well O
, O
she O
's O
more O
thoroughly O
civilized O
-- O
! O
" O
If O
" O
More O
thoroughly O
than O
WHOM O
? O
" O
would O
not O
have O
been O
for O
him O
a O
sequel O
to O
this O
remark O
, O
that O
was O
just O
by O
reason O
of O
his O
deep O
consciousness O
of O
the O
bearing O
of O
his O
comparison O
. O
CHAPTER O
I. O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
Lynde O
is O
Surprised O
| O
MRS. B-PER
Rachel O
Lynde O
lived O
just O
where O
the O
Avonlea B-GPE
main O
road O
dipped O
down O
into O
a O
little O
hollow O
, O
fringed O
with O
alders O
and O
ladies O
’ O
eardrops O
and O
traversed O
by O
a O
brook O
that O
had O
its O
source O
away O
back O
in O
the O
woods O
of O
the O
old O
Cuthbert B-PER
place O
; O
it O
was O
reputed O
to O
be O
an B-LOC
intricate I-LOC
, I-LOC
headlong I-LOC
brook I-LOC
in O
its O
earlier O
course O
through O
those B-LOC
woods I-LOC
, O
with O
dark O
secrets O
of O
pool O
and O
cascade O
; O
but O
by O
the O
time O
it O
reached O
Lynde B-LOC
’s I-LOC
Hollow I-LOC
it O
was O
a B-LOC
quiet I-LOC
, I-LOC
well-conducted I-LOC
little I-LOC
stream I-LOC
, O
for O
not O
even O
a B-LOC
brook I-LOC
could O
run O
past O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
Lynde O
’s O
door O
without O
due O
regard O
for O
decency O
and O
decorum O
; O
it O
probably O
was O
conscious O
that O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
was O
sitting O
at O
her O
window O
, O
keeping O
a O
sharp O
eye O
on O
everything O
that O
passed O
, O
from O
brooks B-LOC
and O
children B-PER
up O
, O
and O
that O
if O
she O
noticed O
anything O
odd O
or O
out O
of O
place O
she O
would O
never O
rest O
until O
she O
had O
ferreted O
out O
the O
whys O
and O
wherefores O
thereof O
. O
There O
are O
plenty O
of O
people B-PER
in O
Avonlea B-GPE
and O
out O
of O
it O
, O
who O
can O
attend O
closely O
to O
their B-PER
neighbor I-PER
’s O
business O
by O
dint O
of O
neglecting O
their O
own O
; O
but O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
Lynde O
was O
one O
of O
those O
capable O
creatures O
who O
can O
manage O
their O
own O
concerns O
and O
those O
of O
other B-PER
folks I-PER
into O
the O
bargain O
. O
She O
was O
a B-PER
notable I-PER
housewife I-PER
; O
her O
work O
was O
always O
done O
and O
well O
done O
; O
she O
“ O
ran O
” O
the O
Sewing O
Circle O
, O
helped O
run O
the O
Sunday-school O
, O
and O
was O
the O
strongest O
prop O
of O
the O
Church B-ORG
Aid I-ORG
Society I-ORG
and O
Foreign B-ORG
Missions I-ORG
Auxiliary I-ORG
. O
Yet O
with O
all O
this O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
found O
abundant O
time O
to O
sit O
for O
hours O
at O
her O
kitchen B-FAC
window O
, O
knitting O
“ O
cotton O
warp O
” O
quilts O
-- O
she O
had O
knitted O
sixteen O
of O
them O
, O
as O
Avonlea B-GPE
housekeepers O
were O
wont O
to O
tell O
in O
awed O
voices O
-- O
and O
keeping O
a O
sharp O
eye O
on O
the O
main O
road O
that O
crossed O
the B-LOC
hollow I-LOC
and O
wound O
up O
the B-LOC
steep I-LOC
red I-LOC
hill I-LOC
beyond I-LOC
. O
Since O
Avonlea B-GPE
occupied O
a O
little O
triangular O
peninsula O
jutting O
out O
into O
the B-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
of I-LOC
St. I-LOC
Lawrence I-LOC
with O
water O
on O
two O
sides O
of O
it O
, O
anybody B-PER
who I-PER
went I-PER
out I-PER
of I-PER
it I-PER
or I-PER
into I-PER
it I-PER
had O
to O
pass O
over O
that B-FAC
hill I-FAC
road I-FAC
and O
so O
run O
the O
unseen O
gauntlet O
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
’s O
all-seeing O
eye O
. O
She O
was O
sitting O
there O
one O
afternoon O
in O
early O
June O
. O
The O
sun O
was O
coming O
in O
at O
the O
window O
warm O
and O
bright O
; O
the B-FAC
orchard I-FAC
on O
the O
slope O
below O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
was O
in O
a O
bridal O
flush O
of O
pinky-white O
bloom O
, O
hummed O
over O
by O
a O
myriad O
of O
bees O
. O
Thomas B-PER
Lynde I-PER
-- O
a O
meek O
little O
man O
whom O
Avonlea B-GPE
people O
called O
“ O
Rachel B-PER
Lynde I-PER
’s O
husband O
” O
-- O
was O
sowing O
his O
late O
turnip O
seed O
on O
the O
hill O
field O
beyond O
the B-FAC
barn I-FAC
; O
and O
Matthew B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
ought O
to O
have O
been O
sowing O
his O
on O
the O
big O
red O
brook O
field O
away O
over O
by O
Green B-FAC
Gables I-FAC
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
knew O
that O
he O
ought O
because O
she O
had O
heard O
him O
tell O
Peter B-PER
Morrison I-PER
the O
evening O
before O
in O
William B-PER
J. I-PER
Blair I-PER
’s O
store O
over O
at O
Carmody B-GPE
that O
he O
meant O
to O
sow O
his O
turnip O
seed O
the O
next O
afternoon O
. O
Peter B-PER
had O
asked O
him O
, O
of O
course O
, O
for O
Matthew B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
had O
never O
been O
known O
to O
volunteer O
information O
about O
anything O
in O
his O
whole O
life O
. O
And O
yet O
here O
was O
Matthew B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
, O
at O
half-past O
three O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
a O
busy O
day O
, O
placidly O
driving O
over O
the B-LOC
hollow I-LOC
and O
up O
the B-LOC
hill I-LOC
; O
moreover O
, O
he O
wore O
a O
white O
collar O
and O
his O
best O
suit O
of O
clothes O
, O
which O
was O
plain O
proof O
that O
he O
was O
going O
out O
of O
Avonlea B-GPE
; O
and O
he O
had O
the B-VEH
buggy I-VEH
and O
the O
sorrel O
mare O
, O
which O
betokened O
that O
he O
was O
going O
a O
considerable O
distance O
. O
Now O
, O
where O
was O
Matthew B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
going O
and O
why O
was O
he O
going O
there O
? O
Had O
it O
been O
any O
other O
man O
in O
Avonlea B-GPE
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
, O
deftly O
putting O
this O
and O
that O
together O
, O
might O
have O
given O
a O
pretty O
good O
guess O
as O
to O
both O
questions O
. O
But O
Matthew B-PER
so O
rarely O
went O
from O
home B-FAC
that O
it O
must O
be O
something O
pressing O
and O
unusual O
which O
was O
taking O
him O
; O
he O
was O
the B-PER
shyest I-PER
man I-PER
alive I-PER
and O
hated O
to O
have O
to O
go O
among O
strangers B-PER
or O
to O
any O
place O
where O
he O
might O
have O
to O
talk O
. O
Matthew B-PER
, O
dressed O
up O
with O
a O
white O
collar O
and O
driving O
in O
a B-VEH
buggy I-VEH
, O
was O
something O
that O
did O
n’t O
happen O
often O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
, O
ponder O
as O
she O
might O
, O
could O
make O
nothing O
of O
it O
and O
her O
afternoon O
’s O
enjoyment O
was O
spoiled O
. O
“ O
I O
’ll O
just O
step O
over O
to O
Green B-FAC
Gables I-FAC
after O
tea O
and O
find O
out O
from O
Marilla B-PER
where O
he O
’s O
gone O
and O
why O
, O
” O
the B-PER
worthy I-PER
woman I-PER
finally O
concluded O
. O
“ O
He O
does O
n’t O
generally O
go O
to O
town B-GPE
this O
time O
of O
year O
and O
he O
_ O
never O
_ O
visits O
; O
if O
he O
’d O
run O
out O
of O
turnip O
seed O
he O
would O
n’t O
dress O
up O
and O
take O
the B-VEH
buggy I-VEH
to O
go O
for O
more O
; O
he O
was O
n’t O
driving O
fast O
enough O
to O
be O
going O
for O
a B-PER
doctor I-PER
. O
Yet O
something O
must O
have O
happened O
since O
last O
night O
to O
start O
him O
off O
. O
I O
’m O
clean O
puzzled O
, O
that O
’s O
what O
, O
and O
I O
wo O
n’t O
know O
a O
minute O
’s O
peace O
of O
mind O
or O
conscience O
until O
I O
know O
what O
has O
taken O
Matthew B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
out O
of O
Avonlea B-GPE
today O
. O
” O
Accordingly O
after O
tea O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
set O
out O
; O
she O
had O
not O
far O
to O
go O
; O
the O
big O
, O
rambling O
, O
orchard-embowered B-FAC
house O
where O
the B-PER
Cuthberts I-PER
lived O
was O
a O
scant O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
up O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
from O
Lynde B-LOC
’s I-LOC
Hollow I-LOC
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
the B-FAC
long I-FAC
lane I-FAC
made O
it O
a O
good O
deal O
further O
. O
Matthew B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
’s O
father O
, O
as O
shy O
and O
silent O
as O
his B-PER
son I-PER
after O
him O
, O
had O
got O
as O
far O
away O
as O
he O
possibly O
could O
from O
his B-PER
fellow I-PER
men I-PER
without O
actually O
retreating O
into O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
when O
he O
founded O
his B-FAC
homestead I-FAC
. O
Green B-FAC
Gables I-FAC
was O
built O
at O
the O
furthest O
edge O
of O
his B-LOC
cleared I-LOC
land I-LOC
and O
there O
it O
was O
to O
this O
day O
, O
barely O
visible O
from O
the O
main O
road O
along O

houses O
were O
so O
sociably O
situated O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
Lynde O
did O
not O
call O
living O
in O
such B-FAC
a I-FAC
place I-FAC
_ O
living O
_ O
at O
all O
. O
“ O
It O
’s O
just O
_ O
staying O
_ O
, O
that O
’s O
what O
, O
” O
she O
said O
as O
she O
stepped O
along O
the B-FAC
deep-rutted I-FAC
, I-FAC
grassy I-FAC
lane I-FAC
bordered I-FAC
with I-FAC
wild I-FAC
rose I-FAC
bushes I-FAC
. O
“ O
It O
’s O
no O
wonder O
Matthew B-PER
and O
Marilla B-PER
are O
both O
a O
little O
odd O
, O
living O
away O
back O
here O
by O
themselves O
. O
Trees O
are O
n’t O
much O
company O
, O
though O
dear O
knows O
if O
they O
were O
there O
’d O
be O
enough O
of O
them O
. O
I O
’d O
ruther O
look O
at O
people B-PER
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
they O
seem O
contented O
enough O
; O
but O
then O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
they O
’re O
used O
to O
it O
. O
A O
body O
can O
get O
used O
to O
anything O
, O
even O
to O
being O
hanged O
, O
as O
the B-PER
Irishman I-PER
said O
. O
” O
With O
this B-PER
Mrs. I-PER
Rachel I-PER
stepped O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
lane I-FAC
into O
the O
backyard O
of O
Green B-FAC
Gables I-FAC
. O
Very O
green O
and O
neat O
and O
precise O
was O
that B-FAC
yard I-FAC
, O
set O
about O
on O
one O
side O
with O
great O
patriarchal O
willows O
and O
the O
other O
with O
prim O
Lombardies O
. O
Not O
a O
stray O
stick O
nor O
stone O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
for O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
would O
have O
seen O
it O
if O
there O
had O
been O
. O
Privately O
she O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
Marilla B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
swept O
that B-FAC
yard I-FAC
over O
as O
often O
as O
she O
swept O
her B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
One O
could O
have O
eaten O
a O
meal O
off O
the O
ground O
without O
over-brimming O
the O
proverbial O
peck O
of O
dirt O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
rapped O
smartly O
at O
the O
kitchen B-FAC
door O
and O
stepped O
in O
when O
bidden O
to O
do O
so O
. O
The O
kitchen O
at O
Green B-FAC
Gables I-FAC
was O
a B-FAC
cheerful I-FAC
apartment I-FAC
-- O
or O
would O
have O
been O
cheerful O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
so O
painfully O
clean O
as O
to O
give O
it O
something O
of O
the O
appearance O
of O
an B-FAC
unused I-FAC
parlor I-FAC
. O
Its O
windows O
looked O
east O
and O
west O
; O
through O
the O
west O
one O
, O
looking O
out O
on O
the B-FAC
back I-FAC
yard I-FAC
, O
came O
a O
flood O
of O
mellow O
June O
sunlight O
; O
but O
the O
east O
one O
, O
whence O
you O
got O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
bloom O
white O
cherry-trees O
in O
the B-FAC
left I-FAC
orchard I-FAC
and O
nodding O
, O
slender O
birches O
down O
in O
the O
hollow O
by O
the B-LOC
brook I-LOC
, O
was O
greened O
over O
by O
a O
tangle O
of O
vines O
. O
Here B-FAC
sat O
Marilla B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
, O
when O
she O
sat O
at O
all O
, O
always O
slightly O
distrustful O
of O
sunshine O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
her O
too O
dancing O
and O
irresponsible O
a O
thing O
for O
a B-LOC
world I-LOC
which I-LOC
was I-LOC
meant I-LOC
to I-LOC
be I-LOC
taken I-LOC
seriously I-LOC
; O
and O
here B-FAC
she O
sat O
now O
, O
knitting O
, O
and O
the O
table O
behind O
her O
was O
laid O
for O
supper O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
, O
before O
she O
had O
fairly O
closed O
the O
door O
, O
had O
taken O
a O
mental O
note O
of O
everything O
that O
was O
on O
that O
table O
. O
There O
were O
three O
plates O
laid O
, O
so O
that O
Marilla B-PER
must O
be O
expecting O
some B-PER
one I-PER
home O
with O
Matthew B-PER
to O
tea O
; O
but O
the O
dishes O
were O
everyday O
dishes O
and O
there O
was O
only O
crab-apple O
preserves O
and O
one O
kind O
of O
cake O
, O
so O
that O
the O
expected O
company O
could O
not O
be O
any O
particular O
company O
. O
Yet O
what O
of O
Matthew B-PER
’s O
white O
collar O
and O
the O
sorrel O
mare O
? O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
was O
getting O
fairly O
dizzy O
with O
this O
unusual O
mystery O
about O
quiet B-FAC
, I-FAC
unmysterious I-FAC
Green I-FAC
Gables I-FAC
. O
“ O
Good O
evening O
, O
Rachel B-PER
, O
” O
Marilla B-PER
said O
briskly O
. O
“ O
This O
is O
a O
real O
fine O
evening O
, O
is O
n’t O
it O
? O
Wo O
n’t O
you O
sit O
down O
? O
How O
are O
all O
your B-PER
folks I-PER
? O
” O
Something O
that O
for O
lack O
of O
any O
other O
name O
might O
be O
called O
friendship O
existed O
and O
always O
had O
existed O
between O
Marilla B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
and O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
-- O
or O
perhaps O
because O
of O
-- O
their O
dissimilarity O
. O
Marilla B-PER
was O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
thin I-PER
woman I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
angles I-PER
and I-PER
without I-PER
curves I-PER
; O
her O
dark O
hair O
showed O
some O
gray O
streaks O
and O
was O
always O
twisted O
up O
in O
a O
hard O
little O
knot O
behind O
with O
two O
wire O
hairpins O
stuck O
aggressively O
through O
it O
. O
She O
looked O
like O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
of I-PER
narrow I-PER
experience I-PER
and I-PER
rigid I-PER
conscience I-PER
, I-PER
which I-PER
she I-PER
was I-PER
; O
but O
there O
was O
a O
saving O
something O
about O
her O
mouth O
which O
, O
if O
it O
had O
been O
ever O
so O
slightly O
developed O
, O
might O
have O
been O
considered O
indicative O
of O
a O
sense O
of O
humor O
. O
“ O
We O
’re O
all O
pretty O
well O
, O
” O
said O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
. O
“ O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
afraid O
_ O
you O
_ O
were O
n’t O
, O
though O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
Matthew B-PER
starting O
off O
today O
. O
I O
thought O
maybe O
he O
was O
going O
to O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
’s O
. O
” O
Marilla B-PER
’s O
lips O
twitched O
understandingly O
. O
She O
had O
expected O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
up O
; O
she O
had O
known O
that O
the O
sight O
of O
Matthew B-PER
jaunting O
off O
so O
unaccountably O
would O
be O
too O
much O
for O
her B-PER
neighbor I-PER
’s O
curiosity O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
no O
, O
I O
’m O
quite O
well O
although O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
headache O
yesterday O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
Matthew B-PER
went O
to O
Bright B-GPE
River I-GPE
. O
We O
’re O
getting O
a B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
from O
an O
orphan B-PER
asylum O
in O
Nova B-GPE
Scotia I-GPE
and O
he O
’s O
coming O
on O
the B-VEH
train I-VEH
tonight O
. O
” O
If O
Marilla B-PER
had O
said O
that O
Matthew B-PER
had O
gone O
to O
Bright B-GPE
River I-GPE
to O
meet O
a O
kangaroo O
from O
Australia B-GPE
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
astonished O
. O
She O
was O
actually O
stricken O
dumb O
for O
five O
seconds O
. O
It O
was O
unsupposable O
that O
Marilla B-PER
was O
making O
fun O
of O
her O
, O
but O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
was O
almost O
forced O
to O
suppose O
it O
. O
“ O
Are O
you O
in O
earnest O
, O
Marilla B-PER
? O
” O
she O
demanded O
when O
voice O
returned O
to O
her O
. O
“ O
Yes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
” O
said O
Marilla B-PER
, O
as O
if O
getting O
boys B-PER
from O
orphan B-PER
asylums O
in O
Nova B-GPE
Scotia I-GPE
were O
part O
of O
the O
usual O
spring O
work O
on O
any O
well-regulated O
Avonlea B-GPE
farm O
instead O
of O
being O
an O
unheard O
of O
innovation O
. O
Mrs. B-PER
Rachel O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
received O
a O
severe O
mental O
jolt O
. O
She O
thought O
in O
exclamation O
points O
. O
A B-PER
boy I-PER
! O
Marilla B-PER
and O
Matthew B-PER
Cuthbert I-PER
of O
all B-PER
people I-PER
adopting O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
! O
From O
an O
orphan B-PER
asylum O
! O
Well O
, O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
was O
certainly O
turning O
upside O
down O
! O
She O
would O
be O
surprised O
at O
nothing O
after O
this O
! O
Nothing O
! O
CHAPTER O
I O
I O
MEET O
SIR B-PER
HENRY I-PER
CURTIS I-PER
It O
is O
a O
curious O
thing O
that O
at O
my O
age O
-- O
fifty-five O
last O
birthday O
-- O
I O
should O
find O
myself O
taking O
up O
a O
pen O
to O
try O
to O
write O
a O
history O
. O
I O
wonder O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
history O
it O
will O
be O
when O
I O
have O
finished O
it O
, O
if O
ever O
I O
come O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
trip O
! O
I O
have O
done O
a O
good O
many O
things O
in O
my O
life O
, O
which O
seems O
a O
long O
one O
to O
me O
, O
owing O
to O
my O
having O
begun O
work O
so O
young O
, O
perhaps O
. O
At O
an O
age O
when O
other B-PER
boys I-PER
are O
at O
school B-ORG
I O
was O
earning O
my O
living O
as O
a O
trader O
in O
the B-GPE
old I-GPE
Colony I-GPE
. O
I O
have O
been O
trading O
, O
hunting O
, O
fighting O
, O
or O
mining O
ever O
since O
. O
And O
yet O
it O
is O
only O
eight O
months O
ago O
that O
I O
made O
my O
pile O
. O
It O
is O
a O
big O
pile O
now O
that O
I O
have O
got O
it O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
yet O
know O
how O
big O
-- O
but O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
would O
go O
through O
the O
last O
fifteen O
or O
sixteen O
months O
again O
for O
it O
; O
no O
, O
not O
if O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
should O
come O
out O
safe O
at O
the O
end O
, O
pile O
and O
all O
. O
But O
then O
I O
am O
a B-PER
timid I-PER
man I-PER
, O
and O
dislike O
violence O
; O
moreover O
, O
I O
am O
almost O
sick O
of O
adventure O
. O
I O
wonder O
why O
I O
am O
going O
to O
write O
this O
book O
: O
it O
is O
not O
in O
my O
line O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a B-PER
literary I-PER
man I-PER
, O
though O
very O
devoted O
to O
the O
Old O
Testament O
and O
also O
to O
the O
" O
Ingoldsby O
Legends O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
try O
to O
set O
down O
my O
reasons O
, O
just O
to O
see O
if O
I O
have O
any O
. O
First O
reason O
: O
Because O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
Curtis O
and O
Captain B-PER
John O
Good O
asked O
me O
. O
Second O
reason O
: O
Because O
I O
am O
laid O
up O
here B-GPE
at O
Durban B-GPE
with O
the O
pain O
in O
my O
left O
leg O
. O
Ever O
since O
that O
confounded O
lion O
got O
hold O
of O
me O
I O
have O
been O
liable O
to O
this O
trouble O
, O
and O
being O
rather O
bad O
just O
now O
, O
it O
makes O
me O
limp O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
There O
must O
be O
some O
poison O
in O
a O
lion O
's O
teeth O
, O
otherwise O
how O
is O
it O
that O
when O
your O
wounds O
are O
healed O
they O
break O
out O
again O
, O
generally O
, O
mark O
you O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
of O
year O
that O
you O
got O
your O
mauling O
? O
It O
is O
a O
hard O
thing O
when O
one O
has O
shot O
sixty-five O
lions O
or O
more O
, O
as O
I O
have O
in O
the O
course O
of O
my O
life O
, O
that O
the O
sixty-sixth O
should O
chew O
your O
leg O
like O
a O
quid O
of O
tobacco O
. O
It O
breaks O
the O
routine O
of O
the O
thing O
, O
and O
putting O
other O
considerations O
aside O
, O
I O
am O
an B-PER
orderly I-PER
man I-PER
and O
do O
n't O
like O
that O
. O
This O
is O
by O
the O
way O
. O
Third O
reason O
: O
Because O
I O
want O
my B-PER
boy I-PER
Harry O
, O
who O
is O
over O
there B-FAC
at O
the B-FAC
hospital I-FAC
in O
London B-GPE
studying O
to O
become O
a B-PER
doctor I-PER
, O
to O
have O
something O
to O
amuse O
him O
and O
keep O
him O
out O
of O
mischief O
for O
a O
week O
or O
so O
. O
Hospital B-ORG
work O
must O
sometimes O
pall O
and O
grow O
rather O
dull O
, O
for O
even O
of O
cutting O
up O
dead O
bodies O
there O
may O
come O
satiety O
, O
and O
as O
this O
history O
will O
not O
be O
dull O
, O
whatever O
else O
it O
may O
be O
, O
it O
will O
put O
a O
little O
life O
into O
things O
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
while O
Harry B-PER
is O
reading O
of O
our O
adventures O
. O
Fourth O
reason O
and O
last O
: O
Because O
I O
am O
going O
to O
tell O
the O
strangest O
story O
that O
I O
remember O
. O
It O
may O
seem O
a O
queer O
thing O
to O
say O
, O
especially O
considering O
that O
there O
is O
no B-PER
woman I-PER
in O
it O
-- O
except O
Foulata B-PER
. O
Stop O
, O
though O
! O
there O
is O
Gagaoola B-PER
, O
if O
she O
was O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
, O
and O
not O
a B-PER
fiend I-PER
. O
But O
she O
was O
a O
hundred O
at O
least O
, O
and O
therefore O
not O
marriageable O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
count O
her O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
there O
is O
not O
a O
_ O
petticoat O
_ O
in O
the O
whole O
history O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
had O
better O
come O
to O
the O
yoke O
. O
It O
is O
a O
stiff O
place O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
were O
bogged O
up O
to O
the O
axle O
. O
But O
, O
" O
_ O
sutjes O
, O
sutjes O
_ O
, O
" O
as O
the B-PER
Boers I-PER
say O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
they O
spell O
it O
-- O
softly O
does O
it O
. O
A O
strong O
team O
will O
come O
through O
at O
last O
, O
that O
is O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
poor O
. O
You O
can O
never O
do O
anything O
with O
poor O
oxen O
. O
Now O
to O
make O
a O
start O
. O
I O
, O
Allan B-PER
Quatermain I-PER
, O
of O
Durban B-GPE
, O
Natal B-GPE
, O
Gentleman B-PER
, O
make O
oath O
and O
say O
-- O
That O
's O
how O
I O
headed O
my O
deposition O
before O
the B-PER
magistrate I-PER
about O
poor O
Khiva B-PER
's O
and O
Ventvögel B-PER
's O
sad O
deaths O
; O
but O
somehow O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
quite O
the O
right O
way O
to O
begin O
a O
book O
. O
And O
, O
besides O
, O
am O
I O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
? O
What O
is O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
? O
I O
do O
n't O
quite O
know O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
have O
had O
to O
do O
with O
niggers B-PER
-- O
no O
, O
I O
will O
scratch O
out O
that O
word O
" O
niggers B-PER
, O
" O
for O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
. O
I O
've O
known O
natives B-PER
who O
_ O
are O
_ O
, O
and O
so O
you O
will O
say O
, O
Harry B-PER
, O
my B-PER
boy I-PER
, O
before O
you O
have O
done O
with O
this O
tale O
, O
and O
I O
have O
known O
mean O
whites O
with O
lots O
of O
money O
and O
fresh O
out O
from O
home B-FAC
, O
too O
, O
who O
_ O
are O
not O
_ O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
I O
was O
born O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
, O
though O
I O
have O
been O
nothing O
but O
a B-PER
poor I-PER
travelling I-PER
trader I-PER
and I-PER
hunter I-PER
all O
my O
life O
. O
Whether O
I O
have O
remained O
so O
I O
known O
not O
, O
you O
must O
judge O
of O
that O
. O
Heaven B-FAC
knows O
I O
've O
tried O
. O
I O
have O
killed O
many B-PER
men I-PER
in O
my O
time O
, O
yet O
I O
have O
never O
slain O
wantonly O
or O
stained O
my O
hand O
in O
innocent O
blood O
, O
but O
only O
in O
self-defence O
. O
The B-PER
Almighty I-PER
gave O
us O
our O
lives O
, O
and O
I O
suppose O
He B-PER
meant O
us O
to O
defend O
them O
, O
at O
least O
I O
have O
always O
acted O
on O
that O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
not O
be O
brought O
up O
against O
me O
when O
my O
clock O
strikes O
. O
There O
, O
there O
, O
it O
is O
a B-LOC
cruel I-LOC
and I-LOC
a I-LOC
wicked I-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
and O
for O
a B-PER
timid I-PER
man I-PER
I O
have O
been O
mixed O
up O
in O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
fighting O
. O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
the O
rights O
of O
it O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
I O
have O
never O
stolen O
, O
though O
once O
I O
cheated O
a B-PER
Kafir I-PER
out O
of O
a O
herd O
of O
cattle O
. O
But O
then O
he O
had O
done O
me O
a O
dirty O
turn O
, O
and O
it O
has O
troubled O
me O
ever O
since O
into O
the O
bargain O
. O
Well O
, O
it O
is O
eighteen O
months O
or O
so O
ago O
since O
first O
I O
met O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
Curtis O
and O
Captain B-PER
Good O
. O
It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
. O
I O
had O
been O
up O
elephant O
hunting O
beyond O
Bamangwato B-GPE
, O
and O
had O
met O
with O
bad O
luck O
. O
Everything O
went O
wrong O
that O
trip O
, O
and O
to O
top O
up O
with O
I O
got O
the O
fever O
badly O
. O
So O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
well O
enough O
I O
trekked O
down O
to O
the B-FAC
Diamond I-FAC
Fields I-FAC
, O
sold O
such O
ivory O
as O
I O
had O
, O
together O
with O
my O
wagon O
and O
oxen O
, O
discharged O
my B-PER
hunters I-PER
, O
and O
took O
the O
post-cart O
to O
the B-LOC
Cape I-LOC
. O
After O
spending O
a O
week O
in O
Cape B-GPE
Town I-GPE
, O
finding O
that O
they O
overcharged O
me O
at O
the B-FAC
hotel I-FAC
, O
and O
having O
seen O
everything O
there O
was O
to O
see O
, O
including O
the O
botanical O
gardens O
, O
which O
seem O
to O
me O
likely O
to O
confer O
a O
great O
benefit O
on O
the B-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
and O
the B-FAC
new I-FAC
Houses I-FAC
of I-FAC
Parliament I-FAC
, O
which O
I O
expect O
will O
do O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Natal B-GPE
by O
the O
_ O
Dunkeld B-GPE
_ O
, O
then O
lying O
at O
the O
docks O
waiting O
for O
the O
_ O
Edinburgh B-GPE
Castle O
_ O
due O
in O
from O
England B-GPE
. O
I O
took O
my O
berth O
and O
went O
aboard O
, O
and O
that O
afternoon O
the O
Natal O
passengers O
from O
the O
_ O
Edinburgh B-GPE
Castle O
_ O
transhipped O
, O
and O
we O
weighed O
and O
put O
to O
sea B-LOC
. O
Among O
these B-PER
passengers I-PER
who I-PER
came I-PER
on I-PER
board I-PER
were O
two B-PER
who I-PER
excited I-PER
my I-PER
curiosity I-PER
. O
One O
, O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
of I-PER
about I-PER
thirty I-PER
, O
was O
perhaps O
the B-PER
biggest-chested I-PER
and I-PER
longest-armed I-PER
man I-PER
I I-PER
ever I-PER
saw I-PER
. O
He O
had O
yellow O
hair O
, O
a O
thick O
yellow O
beard O
, O
clear-cut O
features O
, O
and O
large O
grey O
eyes O
set O
deep O
in O
his O
head O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
a B-PER
finer-looking I-PER
man I-PER
, O
and O
somehow O
he O
reminded O
me O
of O
an B-PER
ancient I-PER
Dane I-PER
. O
Not O
that O
I O
know O
much O
of O
ancient B-PER
Danes I-PER
, O
though O
I O
knew O
a B-PER
modern I-PER
Dane I-PER
who I-PER
did I-PER
me I-PER
out I-PER
of I-PER
ten I-PER
pounds I-PER
; O
but O
I O
remember O
once O
seeing O
a O
picture O
of O
some B-PER
of I-PER
those I-PER
gentry I-PER
, O
who O
, O
I O
take O
it O
, O
were O
a B-PER
kind I-PER
of I-PER
white I-PER
Zulus I-PER
. O
They O
were O
drinking O
out O
of O
big O
horns O
, O
and O
their O
long O
hair O
hung O
down O
their O
backs O
. O
As O
I O
looked O
at O
my B-PER
friend I-PER
standing I-PER
there I-PER
by I-PER
the I-PER
companion-ladder I-PER
, O
I O
thought O
that O
if O
he O
only O
let O
his O
grow O
a O
little O
, O
put O
one O
of O
those O
chain O
shirts O
on O
to O
his O
great O
shoulders O
, O
and O
took O
hold O
of O
a O
battle-axe O
and O
a O
horn O
mug O
, O
he O
might O
have O
sat O
as O
a B-PER
model I-PER
for I-PER
that I-PER
picture I-PER
. O
And O
by O
the O
way O
it O
is O
a O
curious O
thing O
, O
and O
just O
shows O
how O
the O
blood O
will O
out O
, O
I O
discovered O
afterwards O
that O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
Curtis O
, O
for O
that O
was O
the B-PER
big I-PER
man I-PER
's O
name O
, O
is O
of O
Danish O
blood O
. O
[ O
1 O
] O
He O
also O
reminded O
me O
strongly O
of O
somebody B-PER
else I-PER
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
I O
could O
not O
remember O
who O
it O
was O
. O
The O
other O
man O
, O
who O
stood O
talking O
to O
Sir B-PER
Henry O
, O
was O
stout O
and O
dark O
, O
and O
of O
quite O
a O
different O
cut O
. O
I O
suspected O
at O
once O
that O
he O
was O
a B-PER
naval I-PER
officer I-PER
; O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
, O
but O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
mistake O
a B-PER
navy I-PER
man I-PER
. O
I O
have O
gone O
shooting O
trips O
with O
several O
of O
them O
in O
the O
course O
of O
my O
life O
, O
and O
they O
have O
always O
proved O
themselves O
the B-PER
best I-PER
and I-PER
bravest I-PER
and I-PER
nicest I-PER
fellows I-PER
I I-PER
ever I-PER
met I-PER
, O
though O
sadly O
given O
, O
some O
of O
them O
, O
to O
the O
use O
of O
profane O
language O
. O
I O
asked O
a O
page O
or O
two O
back O
, O
what O
is O
a B-PER
gentleman I-PER
? O
I O
'll O
answer O
the O
question O
now O
: O
A B-PER
Royal I-PER
Naval I-PER
officer I-PER
is O
, O
in O
a O
general O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
though O
of O
course O
there O
may O
be O
a O
black O
sheep O
among O
them O
here O
and O
there O
. O
I O
fancy O
it O
is O
just O
the B-LOC
wide I-LOC
seas I-LOC
and O
the O
breath O
of O
God B-PER
's O
winds O
that O
wash O
their O
hearts O
and O
blow O
the O
bitterness O
out O
of O
their O
minds O
and O
make O
them O
what O
men B-PER
ought O
to O
be O
. O
Well O
, O
to O
return O
, O
I O
proved O
right O
again O
; O
I O
ascertained O
that O
the B-PER
dark I-PER
man I-PER
_ O
was O
_ O
a B-PER
naval I-PER
officer I-PER
, O
a B-PER
lieutenant I-PER
of I-PER
thirty-one I-PER
, O
who O
, O
after O
seventeen O
years O
' O
service O
, O
had O
been O
turned O
out O
of O
her B-PER
Majesty I-PER
's O
employ O
with O
the O
barren O
honour O
of O
a B-PER
commander I-PER
's O
rank O
, O
because O
it O
was O
impossible O
that O
he O
should O
be O
promoted O
. O
This O
is O
what O
people O
who O
serve O
the B-PER
Queen I-PER
have O
to O
expect O
: O
to O
be O
shot O
out O
into O
the B-LOC
cold I-LOC
world I-LOC
to O
find O
a O
living O
just O
when O
they O
are O
beginning O
really O
to O
understand O
their O
work O
, O
and O
to O
reach O
the O
prime O
of O
life O
. O
I O
suppose O
they O
do O
n't O
mind O
it O
, O
but O
for O
my O
own O
part O
I O
had O
rather O
earn O
my O
bread O
as O
a B-PER
hunter I-PER
. O
One O
's O
halfpence O
are O
as O
scarce O
perhaps O
, O
but O
you O
do O
not O
get O
so O
many O
kicks O
. O
The B-PER
officer I-PER
's O
name O
I O
found O
out O
-- O
by O
referring O
to O
the B-PER
passengers I-PER
' O
lists O
-- O
was O
Good B-PER
-- O
Captain B-PER
John O
Good O
. O
He O
was O
broad O
, O
of O
medium O
height O
, O
dark O
, O
stout O
, O
and O
rather O
a B-PER
curious I-PER
man I-PER
to I-PER
look I-PER
at I-PER
. O
He O
was O
so O
very O
neat O
and O
so O
very O
clean-shaved O
, O
and O
he O
always O
wore O
an O
eye-glass O
in O
his O
right O
eye O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
grow O
there O
, O
for O
it O
had O
no O
string O
, O
and O
he O
never O
took O
it O
out O
except O
to O
wipe O
it O
. O
At O
first O
I O
thought O
he O
used O
to O
sleep O
in O
it O
, O
but O
afterwards O
I O
found O
that O
this O
was O
a O
mistake O
. O
He O
put O
it O
in O
his O
trousers O
pocket O
when O
he O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
together O
with O
his O
false O
teeth O
, O
of O
which O
he O
had O
two O
beautiful O
sets O
that O
, O
my O
own O
being O
none O
of O
the O
best O
, O
have O
often O
caused O
me O
to O
break O
the O
tenth O
commandment O
. O
But O
I O
am O
anticipating O
. O
CHAPTER O
I O
THERE O
IS O
NO B-PER
ONE I-PER
LEFT O
When O
Mary B-PER
Lennox I-PER
was O
sent O
to O
Misselthwaite B-FAC
Manor I-FAC
to O
live O
with O
her B-PER
uncle I-PER
everybody B-PER
said O
she O
was O
the B-PER
most I-PER
disagreeable-looking I-PER
child I-PER
ever I-PER
seen I-PER
. O
It O
was O
true O
, O
too O
. O
She O
had O
a O
little O
thin O
face O
and O
a O
little O
thin O
body O
, O
thin O
light O
hair O
and O
a O
sour O
expression O
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
yellow O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
yellow O
because O
she O
had O
been O
born O
in O
India B-GPE
and O
had O
always O
been O
ill O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another O
. O
Her B-PER
father I-PER
had O
held O
a O
position O
under O
the B-ORG
English I-ORG
Government I-ORG
and O
had O
always O
been O
busy O
and O
ill O
himself O
, O
and O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
been O
a O
great O
beauty O
who O
cared O
only O
to O
go O
to O
parties O
and O
amuse O
herself O
with O
gay B-PER
people I-PER
. O
She O
had O
not O
wanted O
a B-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
at O
all O
, O
and O
when O
Mary B-PER
was O
born O
she O
handed O
her O
over O
to O
the O
care O
of O
an O
Ayah O
, O
who O
was O
made O
to O
understand O
that O
if O
she O
wished O
to O
please O
the B-PER
Mem I-PER
Sahib I-PER
she O
must O
keep O
the B-PER
child I-PER
out O
of O
sight O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O
So O
when O
she O
was O
a B-PER
sickly I-PER
, I-PER
fretful I-PER
, I-PER
ugly I-PER
little I-PER
baby I-PER
she O
was O
kept O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
and O
when O
she O
became O
a B-PER
sickly I-PER
, I-PER
fretful I-PER
, I-PER
toddling I-PER
thing I-PER
she O
was O
kept O
out O
of O
the O
way O
also O
. O
She O
never O
remembered O
seeing O
familiarly O
anything O
but O
the O
dark O
faces O
of O
her B-PER
Ayah I-PER
and O
the B-PER
other I-PER
native I-PER
servants I-PER
, O
and O
as O
they O
always O
obeyed O
her O
and O
gave O
her O
her O
own O
way O
in O
everything O
, O
because O
the B-PER
Mem I-PER
Sahib I-PER
would O
be O
angry O
if O
she O
was O
disturbed O
by O
her O
crying O
, O
by O
the O
time O
she O
was O
six O
years O
old O
she O
was O
as B-PER
tyrannical I-PER
and I-PER
selfish I-PER
a I-PER
little I-PER
pig I-PER
as I-PER
ever I-PER
lived I-PER
. O
The B-PER
young I-PER
English I-PER
governess I-PER
who I-PER
came I-PER
to I-PER
teach I-PER
her I-PER
to I-PER
read I-PER
and I-PER
write I-PER
disliked O
her O
so O
much O
that O
she O
gave O
up O
her O
place O
in O
three O
months O
, O
and O
when O
other B-PER
governesses I-PER
came O
to O
try O
to O
fill O
it O
they O
always O
went O
away O
in O
a O
shorter O
time O
than O
the B-PER
first I-PER
one I-PER
. O
So O
if O
Mary B-PER
had O
not O
chosen O
to O
really O
want O
to O
know O
how O
to O
read O
books O
she O
would O
never O
have O
learned O
her O
letters O
at O
all O
. O
One O
frightfully O
hot O
morning O
, O
when O
she O
was O
about O
nine O
years O
old O
, O
she O
awakened O
feeling O
very O
cross O
, O
and O
she O
became O
crosser O
still O
when O
she O
saw O
that O
the B-PER
servant I-PER
who I-PER
stood I-PER
by I-PER
her I-PER
bedside I-PER
was O
not O
her B-PER
Ayah I-PER
. O
" O
Why O
did O
you O
come O
? O
" O
she O
said O
to O
the B-PER
strange I-PER
woman I-PER
. O
" O
I O
will O
not O
let O
you O
stay O
. O
Send O
my B-PER
Ayah I-PER
to O
me O
. O
" O
The B-PER
woman I-PER
looked O
frightened O
, O
but O
she O
only O
stammered O
that O
the B-PER
Ayah I-PER
could O
not O
come O
and O
when O
Mary B-PER
threw O
herself O
into O
a O
passion O
and O
beat O
and O
kicked O
her O
, O
she O
looked O
only O
more O
frightened O
and O
repeated O
that O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
for O
the B-PER
Ayah I-PER
to O
come O
to O
Missie B-PER
Sahib O
. O
There O
was O
something O
mysterious O
in O
the O
air O
that O
morning O
. O
Nothing O
was O
done O
in O
its O
regular O
order O
and O
several O
of O
the B-PER
native I-PER
servants I-PER
seemed O
missing O
, O
while O
those O
whom O
Mary B-PER
saw O
slunk O
or O
hurried O
about O
with O
ashy O
and O
scared O
faces O
. O
But O
no B-PER
one I-PER
would O
tell O
her O
anything O
and O
her B-PER
Ayah I-PER
did O
not O
come O
. O
She O
was O
actually O
left O
alone O
as O
the O
morning O
went O
on O
, O
and O
at O
last O
she O
wandered O
out O
into O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
and O
began O
to O
play O
by O
herself O
under O
a O
tree O
near O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
. O
She O
pretended O
that O
she O
was O
making O
a O
flower-bed O
, O
and O
she O
stuck O
big O
scarlet O
hibiscus O
blossoms O
into O
little O
heaps O
of O
earth O
, O
all O
the O
time O
growing O
more O
and O
more O
angry O
and O
muttering O
to O
herself O
the O
things O
she O
would O
say O
and O
the O
names O
she O
would O
call O
Saidie B-PER
when O
she O
returned O
. O
" O
Pig O
! O
Pig O
! O
Daughter B-PER
of I-PER
Pigs I-PER
! O
" O
she O
said O
, O
because O
to O
call O
a B-PER
native I-PER
a O
pig O
is O
the O
worst O
insult O
of O
all O
. O
She O
was O
grinding O
her O
teeth O
and O
saying O
this O
over O
and O
over O
again O
when O
she O
heard O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
come O
out O
on O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
with O
some B-PER
one I-PER
. O
She O
was O
with O
a B-PER
fair I-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
and O
they O
stood O
talking O
together O
in O
low O
strange O
voices O
. O
Mary O
knew O
the O
fair O
young O
man O
who O
looked O
like O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
. O
She O
had O
heard O
that O
he O
was O
a O
very O
young O
officer O
who O
had O
just O
come O
from O
England B-GPE
. O
The B-PER
child I-PER
stared O
at O
him O
, O
but O
she O
stared O
most O
at O
her B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
She O
always O
did O
this O
when O
she O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
see O
her O
, O
because O
the B-PER
Mem I-PER
Sahib I-PER
-- O
Mary B-PER
used O
to O
call O
her O
that O
oftener O
than O
anything O
else O
-- O
was O
such O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
slim I-PER
, I-PER
pretty I-PER
person I-PER
and O
wore O
such O
lovely O
clothes O
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
like O
curly O
silk O
and O
she O
had O
a O
delicate O
little O
nose O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
disdaining O
things O
, O
and O
she O
had O
large O
laughing O
eyes O
. O
All O
her O
clothes O
were O
thin O
and O
floating O
, O
and O
Mary B-PER
said O
they O
were O
" O
full O
of O
lace O
. O
" O
They O
looked O
fuller O
of O
lace O
than O
ever O
this O
morning O
, O
but O
her O
eyes O
were O
not O
laughing O
at O
all O
. O
They O
were O
large O
and O
scared O
and O
lifted O
imploringly O
to O
the B-PER
fair I-PER
boy I-PER
officer I-PER
's O
face O
. O
" O
Is O
it O
so O
very O
bad O
? O
Oh O
, O
is O
it O
? O
" O
Mary B-PER
heard O
her O
say O
. O
" O
Awfully O
, O
" O
the B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
answered O
in O
a O
trembling O
voice O
. O
" O
Awfully O
, O
Mrs. B-PER
Lennox O
. O
You O
ought O
to O
have O
gone O
to O
the B-LOC
hills I-LOC
two O
weeks O
ago O
. O
" O
The B-PER
Mem I-PER
Sahib I-PER
wrung O
her O
hands O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
know O
I O
ought O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
I O
only O
stayed O
to O
go O
to O
that O
silly O
dinner O
party O
. O
What O
a B-PER
fool I-PER
I O
was O
! O
" O
At O
that O
very O
moment O
such O
a O
loud O
sound O
of O
wailing O
broke O
out O
from O
the B-PER
servants I-PER
' O
quarters O
that O
she O
clutched O
the B-PER
young I-PER
man I-PER
's O
arm O
, O
and O
Mary B-PER
stood O
shivering O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
. O
The O
wailing O
grew O
wilder O
and O
wilder O
. O
" O
What O
is O
it O
? O
What O
is O
it O
? O
" O
Mrs. B-PER
Lennox O
gasped O
. O
" O
Some B-PER
one I-PER
has O
died O
, O
" O
answered O
the B-PER
boy I-PER
officer I-PER
. O
" O
You O
did O
not O
say O
it O
had O
broken O
out O
among O
your B-PER
servants I-PER
. O
" O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
! O
" O
the B-PER
Mem I-PER
Sahib I-PER
cried O
. O
" O
Come O
with O
me O
! O
Come O
with O
me O
! O
" O
and O
she O
turned O
and O
ran O
into O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
. O
After O
that O
, O
appalling O
things O
happened O
, O
and O
the O
mysteriousness O
of O
the O
morning O
was O
explained O
to O
Mary B-PER
. O
The O
cholera O
had O
broken O
out O
in O
its O
most O
fatal O
form O
and O
people B-PER
were O
dying O
like O
flies O
. O
The B-PER
Ayah I-PER
had O
been O
taken O
ill O
in O
the O
night O
, O
and O
it O
was O
because O
she O
had O
just O
died O
that O
the B-PER
servants I-PER
had O
wailed O
in O
the B-FAC
huts I-FAC
. O
Before O
the O
next O
day O
three B-PER
other I-PER
servants I-PER
were O
dead O
and O
others O
had O
run O
away O
in O
terror O
. O
There O
was O
panic O
on O
every O
side O
, O
and O
dying B-PER
people I-PER
in O
all O
the B-FAC
bungalows I-FAC
. O
During O
the O
confusion O
and O
bewilderment O
of O
the O
second O
day O
Mary B-PER
hid O
herself O
in O
the B-FAC
nursery I-FAC
and O
was O
forgotten O
by O
everyone B-PER
. O
Nobody B-PER
thought O
of O
her O
, O
nobody B-PER
wanted O
her O
, O
and O
strange O
things O
happened O
of O
which O
she O
knew O
nothing O
. O
Mary O
alternately O
cried O
and O
slept O
through O
the O
hours O
. O
She O
only O
knew O
that O
people B-PER
were O
ill O
and O
that O
she O
heard O
mysterious O
and O
frightening O
sounds O
. O
Once O
she O
crept O
into O
the B-FAC
dining-room I-FAC
and O
found O
it O
empty O
, O
though O
a O
partly O
finished O
meal O
was O
on O
the O
table O
and O
chairs O
and O
plates O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
hastily O
pushed O
back O
when O
the B-PER
diners I-PER
rose O
suddenly O
for O
some O
reason O
. O
The B-PER
child I-PER
ate O
some O
fruit O
and O
biscuits O
, O
and O
being O
thirsty O
she O
drank O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
which O
stood O
nearly O
filled O
. O
It O
was O
sweet O
, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
know O
how O
strong O
it O
was O
. O
Very O
soon O
it O
made O
her O
intensely O
drowsy O
, O
and O
she O
went O
back O
to O
her B-FAC
nursery I-FAC
and O
shut O
herself O
in O
again O
, O
frightened O
by O
cries O
she O
heard O
in O
the B-FAC
huts I-FAC
and O
by O
the O
hurrying O
sound O
of O
feet O
. O
The O
wine O
made O
her O
so O
sleepy O
that O
she O
could O
scarcely O
keep O
her O
eyes O
open O
and O
she O
lay O
down O
on O
her O
bed O
and O
knew O
nothing O
more O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
Many O
things O
happened O
during O
the O
hours O
in O
which O
she O
slept O
so O
heavily O
, O
but O
she O
was O
not O
disturbed O
by O
the O
wails O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
things O
being O
carried O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
bungalow I-FAC
. O
When O
she O
awakened O
she O
lay O
and O
stared O
at O
the O
wall O
. O
The B-FAC
house I-FAC
was O
perfectly O
still O
. O
She O
had O
never O
known O
it O
to O
be O
so O
silent O
before O
. O
She O
heard O
neither O
voices O
nor O
footsteps O
, O
and O
wondered O
if O
everybody B-PER
had O
got O
well O
of O
the O
cholera O
and O
all O
the O
trouble O
was O
over O
. O
She O
wondered O
also O
who O
would O
take O
care O
of O
her O
now O
her B-PER
Ayah I-PER
was O
dead O
. O
There O
would O
be O
a B-PER
new I-PER
Ayah I-PER
, O
and O
perhaps O
she O
would O
know O
some O
new O
stories O
. O
Mary B-PER
had O
been O
rather O
tired O
of O
the O
old O
ones O
. O
She O
did O
not O
cry O
because O
her B-PER
nurse I-PER
had O
died O
. O
She O
was O
not O
an B-PER
affectionate I-PER
child I-PER
and O
had O
never O
cared O
much O
for O
any B-PER
one I-PER
. O
The O
noise O
and O
hurrying O
about O
and O
wailing O
over O
the O
cholera O
had O
frightened O
her O
, O
and O
she O
had O
been O
angry O
because O
no B-PER
one I-PER
seemed O
to O
remember O
that O
she O
was O
alive O
. O
Everyone B-PER
was O
too O
panic-stricken O
to O
think O
of O
a O
little O
girl O
no B-PER
one I-PER
was O
fond O
of O
. O
When O
people B-PER
had O
the O
cholera O
it O
seemed O
that O
they O
remembered O
nothing O
but O
themselves O
. O
But O
if O
everyone B-PER
had O
got O
well O
again O
, O
surely O
some O
one O
would O
remember O
and O
come O
to O
look O
for O
her O
. O
But O
no B-PER
one I-PER
came O
, O
and O
as O
she O
lay O
waiting O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
seemed O
to O
grow O
more O
and O
more O
silent O
. O
She O
heard O
something O
rustling O
on O
the O
matting O
and O
when O
she O
looked O
down O
she O
saw O
a O
little O
snake O
gliding O
along O
and O
watching O
her O
with O
eyes O
like O
jewels O
. O
She O
was O
not O
frightened O
, O
because O
he O
was O
a O
harmless O
little O
thing O
who O
would O
not O
hurt O
her O
and O
he O
seemed O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
He O
slipped O
under O
the O
door O
as O
she O
watched O
him O
. O
" O
How O
queer O
and O
quiet O
it O
is O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
It O
sounds O
as O
if O
there O
were O
no B-PER
one I-PER
in O
the B-FAC
bungalow I-FAC
but O
me O
and O
the O
snake O
. O
" O
Almost O
the O
next O
minute O
she O
heard O
footsteps O
in O
the B-FAC
compound I-FAC
, O
and O
then O
on O
the B-FAC
veranda I-FAC
. O
They O
were O
men B-PER
's O
footsteps O
, O
and O
the B-PER
men I-PER
entered O
the B-FAC
bungalow I-FAC
and O
talked O
in O
low O
voices O
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
went O
to O
meet O
or O
speak O
to O
them O
and O
they O
seemed O
to O
open O
doors O
and O
look O
into O
rooms B-FAC
. O
" O
What O
desolation O
! O
" O
she O
heard O
one O
voice O
say O
. O
" O
That B-PER
pretty I-PER
, I-PER
pretty I-PER
woman I-PER
! O
I O
suppose O
the B-PER
child I-PER
, O
too O
. O
I O
heard O
there O
was O
a B-PER
child I-PER
, O
though O
no B-PER
one I-PER
ever O
saw O
her O
. O
" O
Mary B-PER
was O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the B-FAC
nursery I-FAC
when O
they O
opened O
the O
door O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
. O
She O
looked O
an B-PER
ugly I-PER
, I-PER
cross I-PER
little I-PER
thing I-PER
and O
was O
frowning O
because O
she O
was O
beginning O
to O
be O
hungry O
and O
feel O
disgracefully O
neglected O
. O
The B-PER
first I-PER
man I-PER
who I-PER
came I-PER
in I-PER
was O
a O
large O
officer O
she O
had O
once O
seen O
talking O
to O
her B-PER
father I-PER
. O
He O
looked O
tired O
and O
troubled O
, O
but O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
he O
was O
so O
startled O
that O
he O
almost O
jumped O
back O
. O
" O
Barney B-PER
! O
" O
he O
cried O
out O
. O
" O
There O
is O
a B-PER
child I-PER
here B-FAC
! O
A B-PER
child I-PER
alone O
! O
In O
a B-FAC
place I-FAC
like I-FAC
this I-FAC
! O
Mercy O
on O
us O
, O
who O
is O
she O
! O
" O
" O
I O
am O
Mary B-PER
Lennox I-PER
, O
" O
the B-PER
little I-PER
girl I-PER
said I-PER
, I-PER
drawing I-PER
herself I-PER
up I-PER
stiffly I-PER
. O
She O
thought O
the B-PER
man I-PER
was O
very O
rude O
to O
call O
her B-PER
father I-PER
's O
bungalow O
" O
A B-FAC
place I-FAC
like I-FAC
this I-FAC
! O
" O
" O
I O
fell O
asleep O
when O
everyone B-PER
had O
the O
cholera O
and O
I O
have O
only O
just O
wakened O
up O
. O
Why O
does O
nobody B-PER
come O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
the O
child O
no B-PER
one I-PER
ever O
saw O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the B-PER
man I-PER
, O
turning O
to O
his B-PER
companions I-PER
. O
" O
She O
has O
actually O
been O
forgotten O
! O
" O
I O
The O
day O
broke O
gray O
and O
dull O
. O
The O
clouds O
hung O
heavily O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
rawness O
in O
the O
air O
that O
suggested O
snow O
. O
A B-PER
woman I-PER
servant I-PER
came O
into O
a O
room O
in O
which O
a B-PER
child I-PER
was O
sleeping O
and O
drew O
the O
curtains O
. O
She O
glanced O
mechanically O
at O
the B-FAC
house I-FAC
opposite I-FAC
, O
a O
stucco O
house O
with O
a B-FAC
portico I-FAC
, O
and O
went O
to O
the B-PER
child I-PER
's O
bed O
. O
" O
Wake O
up O
, O
Philip B-PER
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
She O
pulled O
down O
the O
bed-clothes O
, O
took O
him O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
carried O
him O
downstairs B-FAC
. O
He O
was O
only O
half O
awake O
. O
" O
Your B-PER
mother I-PER
wants O
you O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
She O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
a O
room O
on O
the B-FAC
floor I-FAC
below I-FAC
and O
took O
the B-PER
child I-PER
over O
to O
a O
bed O
in O
which O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
was O
lying O
. O
It O
was O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
. O
She O
stretched O
out O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
the B-PER
child I-PER
nestled O
by O
her O
side O
. O
He O
did O
not O
ask O
why O
he O
had O
been O
awakened O
. O
The B-PER
woman I-PER
kissed O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
with O
thin O
, O
small O
hands O
felt O
the B-PER
warm I-PER
body I-PER
through O
his O
white O
flannel O
nightgown O
. O
She O
pressed O
him O
closer O
to O
herself O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
sleepy O
, O
darling B-PER
? O
" O
she O
said O
. O
Her O
voice O
was O
so O
weak O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
come O
already O
from O
a O
great O
distance O
. O
The B-PER
child I-PER
did O
not O
answer O
, O
but O
smiled O
comfortably O
. O
He O
was O
very O
happy O
in O
the O
large O
, O
warm O
bed O
, O
with O
those O
soft O
arms O
about O
him O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
make O
himself O
smaller O
still O
as O
he O
cuddled O
up O
against O
his B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
and O
he O
kissed O
her O
sleepily O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
he O
closed O
his O
eyes O
and O
was O
fast O
asleep O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
came O
forwards O
and O
stood O
by O
the O
bed-side O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
do O
n't O
take O
him O
away O
yet O
, O
" O
she O
moaned O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
, O
without O
answering O
, O
looked O
at O
her O
gravely O
. O
Knowing O
she O
would O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
keep O
the B-PER
child I-PER
much O
longer O
, O
the B-PER
woman I-PER
kissed O
him O
again O
; O
and O
she O
passed O
her O
hand O
down O
his B-PER
body I-PER
till O
she O
came O
to O
his O
feet O
; O
she O
held O
the O
right O
foot O
in O
her O
hand O
and O
felt O
the O
five O
small O
toes O
; O
and O
then O
slowly O
passed O
her O
hand O
over O
the O
left O
one O
. O
She O
gave O
a O
sob O
. O
" O
What O
's O
the O
matter O
? O
" O
said O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
. O
" O
You O
're O
tired O
. O
" O
She O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
the O
tears O
rolled O
down O
her O
cheeks O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
bent O
down O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
take O
him O
. O
" O
She O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
resist O
his O
wish O
, O
and O
she O
gave O
the B-PER
child I-PER
up O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
handed O
him O
back O
to O
his B-PER
nurse I-PER
. O
" O
You O
'd O
better O
put O
him O
back O
in O
his O
own O
bed O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
sir B-PER
. O
" O
The B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
still O
sleeping O
, O
was O
taken O
away O
. O
His B-PER
mother I-PER
sobbed O
now O
broken-heartedly O
. O
" O
What O
will O
happen O
to O
him O
, O
poor B-PER
child I-PER
? O
" O
The B-PER
monthly I-PER
nurse I-PER
tried O
to O
quiet O
her O
, O
and O
presently O
, O
from O
exhaustion O
, O
the O
crying O
ceased O
. O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
walked O
to O
a O
table O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
upon O
which O
, O
under O
a O
towel O
, O
lay O
the O
body O
of O
a B-PER
still-born I-PER
child I-PER
. O
He O
lifted O
the O
towel O
and O
looked O
. O
He O
was O
hidden O
from O
the O
bed O
by O
a O
screen O
, O
but O
the B-PER
woman I-PER
guessed O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
. O
" O
Was O
it O
a B-PER
girl I-PER

Another B-PER

" O
The B-PER
woman I-PER
did O
not O

In O
a O
moment O
the B-PER
child I-PER

nurse O
came O
back O
. O
She O
approached O
the O
bed O
. O
" O
Master B-PER
Philip O
never O
woke O
up O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
There O
was O
a O
pause O
. O
Then O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
felt O
his B-PER
patient I-PER

pulse O
once O
more O
. O
" O
I O

said O
the B-PER
child I-PER

They O
walked O
downstairs B-FAC
in O
silence O
. O
In O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
stopped O
. O
" O

it O

" O
The B-PER
doctor I-PER
shook O
his O

II O
It O
was O
a O
week O
later O
. O
Philip B-PER
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
at O
Miss B-PER
Watkin O
's O
house O
in O
Onslow B-FAC
gardens I-FAC
. O
He O
was O
an B-PER
only I-PER
child I-PER
and O
used O
to O
amusing O
himself O
. O
The B-FAC
room I-FAC
was O
filled O
with O
massive O
furniture O
, O
and O
on O
each O
of O
the O
sofas O
were O
three O
big O
cushions O
. O
There O
was O
a O
cushion O
too O
in O
each O
arm-chair O
. O
All O
these O
he O
had O
taken O
and O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
gilt O
rout O
chairs O
, O
light O
and O
easy O
to O
move O
, O
had O
made O
an O
elaborate O
cave O
in O
which O
he O
could O
hide O
himself O
from O
the B-PER
Red I-PER
Indians I-PER
who I-PER
were I-PER
lurking I-PER
behind I-PER
the I-PER
curtains I-PER
. O
He O
put O
his O
ear O
to O
the O
floor O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
herd O
of O
buffaloes O
that O
raced O
across O
the B-LOC
prairie I-LOC
. O
Presently O
, O
hearing O
the O
door O
open O
, O
he O
held O
his O
breath O
so O
that O
he O
might O
not O
be O
discovered O
; O
but O
a O
violent O
hand O
pulled O
away O
a O
chair O
and O
the O
cushions O
fell O
down O
. O
" O
You B-PER
naughty I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
Miss B-PER
Watkin O
WILL O
be O
cross O
with O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Hulloa O
, O
Emma B-PER
! O
" O
he O
said O
. O
The B-PER
nurse I-PER
bent O
down O
and O
kissed O
him O
, O
then O
began O
to O
shake O
out O
the O
cushions O
, O
and O
put O
them O
back O
in O
their O
places O
. O
" O
Am O
I O
to O
come O
home B-FAC
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
've O
come O
to O
fetch O
you O
. O
" O
" O
You O
've O
got O
a O
new O
dress O
on O
. O
" O
It O
was O
in O
eighteen-eighty-five O
, O
and O
she O
wore O
a O
bustle O
. O
Her O
gown O
was O
of O
black O
velvet O
, O
with O
tight O
sleeves O
and O
sloping O
shoulders O
, O
and O
the O
skirt O
had O
three O
large O
flounces O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
black O
bonnet O
with O
velvet O
strings O
. O
She O
hesitated O
. O
The O
question O
she O
had O
expected O
did O
not O
come O
, O
and O
so O
she O
could O
not O
give O
the O
answer O
she O
had O
prepared O
. O
" O
Are O
n't O
you O
going O
to O
ask O
how O
your B-PER
mamma I-PER
is O
? O
" O
she O
said O
at O
length O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
forgot O
. O
How O
is O
mamma B-PER
? O
" O
Now O
she O
was O
ready O
. O
" O
Your B-PER
mamma I-PER
is O
quite O
well O
and O
happy O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
am O
glad O
. O
" O
" O
Your B-PER
mamma I-PER
's O
gone O
away O
. O
You O
wo O
n't O
ever O
see O
her O
any O
more O
. O
" O
Philip B-PER
did O
not O
know O
what O
she O
meant O
. O
" O
Why O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Your B-PER
mamma I-PER
's O
in O
heaven B-LOC
. O
" O
She O
began O
to O
cry O
, O
and O
Philip B-PER
, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
quite O
understand O
, O
cried O
too O
. O
Emma B-PER
was O
a B-PER
tall I-PER
, I-PER
big-boned I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
with O
fair O
hair O
and O
large O
features O
. O
She O
came O
from O
Devonshire B-GPE
and O
, O
notwithstanding O
her O
many O
years O
of O
service O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
had O
never O
lost O
the O
breadth O
of O
her O
accent O
. O
Her O
tears O
increased O
her O
emotion O
, O
and O
she O
pressed O
the B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
to O
her O
heart O
. O
She O
felt O
vaguely O
the O
pity O
of O
that B-PER
child I-PER
deprived O
of O
the O
only O
love O
in O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
that O
is O
quite O
unselfish O
. O
It O
seemed O
dreadful O
that O
he O
must O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
strangers B-PER
. O
But O
in O
a O
little O
while O
she O
pulled O
herself O
together O
. O
" O
Your B-PER
Uncle I-PER
William B-PER
is O
waiting O
in O
to O
see O
you O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
Go O
and O
say O
good-bye O
to O
Miss B-PER
Watkin O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
go O
home B-FAC
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
say O
good-bye O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
instinctively O
anxious O
to O
hide O
his O
tears O
. O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
run O
upstairs B-FAC
and O
get O
your O
hat O
. O
" O
He O
fetched O
it O
, O
and O
when O
he O
came O
down B-LOC
Emma B-PER
was O
waiting O
for O
him O
in O
the B-FAC
hall I-FAC
. O
He O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
voices O
in O
the B-FAC
study I-FAC
behind O
the B-FAC
dining-room I-FAC
. O
He O
paused O
. O
He O
knew O
that O
Miss B-PER
Watkin O
and O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
were O
talking O
to O
friends B-PER
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
-- O
he O
was O
nine O
years O
old O
-- O
that O
if O
he O
went O
in O
they O
would O
be O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O
" O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
go O

say O
good-bye O
to O
Miss B-PER
Watkin O

" O
" O
I O
think O
you O

better O

" O
said O
Emma B-PER
. O
" O
Go O
in O
and O
tell O
them O
I O
'm O
coming O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
He O
wished O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
his O
opportunity O
. O
Emma B-PER
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
and O
walked O
in O
. O
He O
heard O
her O
speak O
. O
" O
Master B-PER
Philip O
wants O
to O
say O
good-bye O
to O
you O
, O
miss B-PER
. O
" O
There O
was O
a O
sudden O
hush O
of O
the O
conversation O
, O
and O
Philip B-PER
limped O
in O
. O
Henrietta B-PER
Watkin I-PER
was O
a B-PER
stout I-PER
woman I-PER
, O
with O
a O
red O
face O
and O
dyed O
hair O
. O
In O
those O
days O
to O
dye O
the O
hair O
excited O
comment O
, O
and O
Philip B-PER
had O
heard O
much O
gossip O
at O
home B-FAC
when O
his B-PER
godmother I-PER
's O
changed O
colour O
. O
She O
lived O
with O
an B-PER
elder I-PER
sister I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
resigned I-PER
herself I-PER
contentedly I-PER
to I-PER
old I-PER
age I-PER
. O
Two O
ladies O
, O
whom O
Philip B-PER
did O
not O
know O
, O
were O
calling O
, O
and O
they O
looked O
at O
him O
curiously O
. O
" O
My B-PER
poor I-PER
child I-PER
, O
" O
said O
Miss B-PER
Watkin O
, O
opening O
her O
arms O
. O
She O
began O
to O
cry O
. O
Philip B-PER
understood O
now O
why O
she O
had O
not O
been O
in O
to O
luncheon O
and O
why O
she O
wore O
a O
black O
dress O
. O
She O
could O
not O
speak O
. O
" O
I O
've O
got O
to O
go O
home B-FAC
, O
" O
said O
Philip B-PER
, O
at O
last O
. O
He O
disengaged O
himself O
from O
Miss B-PER
Watkin O
's O
arms O
, O
and O
she O
kissed O
him O
again O
. O
Then O
he O
went O
to O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
and O
bade O
her O
good-bye O
too O
. O
One O
of O
the B-PER
strange I-PER
ladies I-PER
asked O
if O
she O
might O
kiss O
him O
, O
and O
he O
gravely O
gave O
her O
permission O
. O
Though O
crying O
, O
he O
keenly O
enjoyed O
the O
sensation O
he O
was O
causing O
; O
he O
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
stay O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
be O
made O
much O
of O
, O
but O
felt O
they O
expected O
him O
to O
go O
, O
so O
he O
said O
that O
Emma B-PER
was O
waiting O
for O
him O
. O
He O
went O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
. O
Emma B-PER
had O
gone O
downstairs B-FAC
to O
speak O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
the B-FAC
basement I-FAC
, O
and O
he O
waited O
for O
her O
on O
the B-FAC
landing I-FAC
. O
He O
heard O
Henrietta B-PER
Watkin I-PER
's O
voice O
. O
" O
His B-PER
mother I-PER
was O
my B-PER
greatest I-PER
friend I-PER

I O
ca O

" O
" O
You O

Henrietta O

" O
said O
her B-PER
sister I-PER
. O
" O
I O
knew O
it O
would O
upset O
you O

" O
Then O
one O
of O
the B-PER
strangers I-PER
spoke O
. O
" O
Poor B-PER
little I-PER
boy I-PER
, O
it O
's O
dreadful O
to O
think O

him O
quite O

I O
see O
he O
limps O

" O
" O
Yes O

he O

got O
a O
club-foot O

It O
was O
such O
a O
grief O
to O
his B-PER
mother I-PER

" O
Then O
Emma B-PER
came O
back O
. O
They O
called O
a O
hansom O
, O
and O
she O
told O
the B-PER
driver I-PER
where B-LOC
to I-LOC
go I-LOC
. O
III O
When O
they O
reached O
the O
house O
Mrs. B-PER
Carey O
had O
died O
in O

it O
was O
in O
a O
dreary O

High B-GPE

Kensington B-GPE

Emma B-PER

Philip B-PER

His B-PER

CHAPTER O
I O
You O
must O
go O
back O
with O
me O
to O
the O
autumn O
of O
1827 O
. O
My B-PER
father I-PER
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
gentleman B-PER
farmer I-PER
in O
— O
shire O
; O
and O
I O
, O
by O
his O
express O
desire O
, O
succeeded O
him O
in O
the O
same O
quiet O
occupation O
, O
not O
very O
willingly O
, O
for O
ambition O
urged O
me O
to O
higher O
aims O
, O
and O
self-conceit O
assured O
me O
that O
, O
in O
disregarding O
its O
voice O
, O
I O
was O
burying O
my O
talent O
in O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
hiding O
my O
light O
under O
a O
bushel O
. O
My B-PER
mother I-PER
had O
done O
her O
utmost O
to O
persuade O
me O
that O
I O
was O
capable O
of O
great O
achievements O
; O
but O
my B-PER
father I-PER
, O
who O
thought O
ambition O
was O
the O
surest O
road O
to O
ruin O
, O
and O
change O
but O
another O
word O
for O
destruction O
, O
would O
listen O
to O
no O
scheme O
for O
bettering O
either O
my O
own O
condition O
, O
or O
that O
of O
my B-PER
fellow I-PER
mortals I-PER
. O
He O
assured O
me O
it O
was O
all O
rubbish O
, O
and O
exhorted O
me O
, O
with O
his O
dying O
breath O
, O
to O
continue O
in O
the O
good O
old O
way O
, O
to O
follow O
his O
steps O
, O
and O
those O
of O
his B-PER
father I-PER
before O
him O
, O
and O
let O
my O
highest O
ambition O
be O
to O
walk O
honestly O
through O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
, O
looking O
neither O
to O
the O
right O
hand O
nor O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
to O
transmit O
the B-LOC
paternal I-LOC
acres I-LOC
to O
my B-PER
children I-PER
in O
, O
at O
least O
, O
as O
flourishing O
a O
condition O
as O
he O
left O
them O
to O
me O
. O
‘ O
Well O
! O
— O
an B-PER
honest I-PER
and I-PER
industrious I-PER
farmer I-PER
is O
one O
of O
the B-PER
most I-PER
useful I-PER
members I-PER
of I-PER
society I-PER
; O
and O
if O
I O
devote O
my O
talents O
to O
the O
cultivation O
of O
my B-FAC
farm I-FAC
, O
and O
the O
improvement O
of O
agriculture O
in O
general O

I O
shall O
thereby O
benefit O
, O
not O
only O
my B-PER
own I-PER
immediate I-PER
connections I-PER
and I-PER
dependants I-PER
, O
but O
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
mankind B-PER
at I-PER
large I-PER
: O
— O
hence O
I O
shall O
not O
have O
lived O
in O
vain O
. O
’ O
With O
such O
reflections O
as O
these O
I O
was O
endeavouring O
to O
console O
myself O
, O
as O
I O
plodded O
home B-FAC
from O
the B-LOC
fields I-LOC
, O
one O
cold O
, O
damp O
, O
cloudy O
evening O
towards O
the O
close O
of O
October O
. O
But O
the O
gleam O
of O
a O
bright O
red O
fire O
through O
the B-FAC
parlour I-FAC
window O
had O
more O
effect O
in O
cheering O
my O
spirits O
, O
and O
rebuking O
my O
thankless O
repinings O
, O
than O
all O
the O
sage O
reflections O
and O
good O
resolutions O
I O
had O
forced O
my O
mind O
to O
frame O
; O
— O
for O
I O
was O
young O
then O
, O
remember O
— O
only O
four-and-twenty O
— O
and O
had O
not O
acquired O
half O
the O
rule O
over O
my O
own O
spirit O
that O
I O
now O
possess O
— O
trifling O
as O
that O
may O
be O
. O
However O
, O
that O
haven O
of O
bliss O
must O
not O
be O
entered O
till O
I O
had O
exchanged O
my O
miry O
boots O
for O
a O
clean O
pair O
of O
shoes O
, O
and O
my O
rough O
surtout O
for O
a O
respectable O
coat O
, O
and O
made O
myself O
generally O
presentable O
before O
decent B-PER
society I-PER
; O
for O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
all I-PER
her I-PER
kindness I-PER
, O
was O
vastly O
particular O
on O
certain O
points O
. O
In O
ascending O
to O
my B-FAC
room I-FAC
I O
was O
met O
upon O
the B-FAC
stairs I-FAC
by O
a B-PER
smart I-PER
, I-PER
pretty I-PER
girl I-PER
of I-PER
nineteen I-PER
, I-PER
with I-PER
a I-PER
tidy I-PER
, I-PER
dumpy I-PER
figure I-PER
, I-PER
a I-PER
round I-PER
face I-PER
, I-PER
bright I-PER
, I-PER
blooming I-PER
cheeks I-PER
, I-PER
glossy I-PER
, I-PER
clustering I-PER
curls I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
little I-PER
merry I-PER
brown I-PER
eyes I-PER
. O
I O
need O
not O
tell O
you O
this O
was O
my B-PER
sister I-PER
Rose B-PER
. O
She O
is O
, O
I O
know O
, O
a B-PER
comely I-PER
matron I-PER
still I-PER
, O
and O
, O
doubtless O
, O
no O
less O
lovely O
— O
in O
your O
eyes O
— O
than O
on O
the O
happy O
day O
you O
first O
beheld O
her O
. O
Nothing O
told O
me O
then O
that O
she O
, O
a O
few O
years O
hence O
, O
would O
be O
the O
wife O
of O
one O
entirely O
unknown O
to O
me O
as O
yet O
, O
but O
destined O
hereafter O
to O
become O
a O
closer O
friend O
than O
even O
herself O
, O
more O
intimate O
than O
that B-PER
unmannerly I-PER
lad I-PER
of I-PER
seventeen I-PER
, O
by O
whom O
I O
was O
collared O
in O
the O
passage O
, O
on O
coming O
down O
, O
and O
well-nigh O
jerked O
off O
my O
equilibrium O
, O
and O
who O
, O
in O
correction O
for O
his O
impudence O
, O
received O
a O
resounding O
whack O
over O
the O
sconce O
, O
which O
, O
however O
, O
sustained O
no O
serious O
injury O
from O
the O
infliction O
; O
as O
, O
besides O
being O
more O
than O
commonly O
thick O
, O
it O
was O
protected O
by O
a O
redundant O
shock O
of O
short O
, O
reddish O
curls O
, O
that O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
called O
auburn O
. O
On O
entering O
the B-FAC
parlour I-FAC
we O
found O
that B-PER
honoured I-PER
lady I-PER
seated I-PER
in I-PER
her I-PER
arm-chair I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
fireside I-PER
, I-PER
working I-PER
away I-PER
at I-PER
her I-PER
knitting I-PER
, I-PER
according I-PER
to I-PER
her I-PER
usual I-PER
custom I-PER
, I-PER
when I-PER
she I-PER
had I-PER
nothing I-PER
else I-PER
to I-PER
do I-PER
. O
She O
had O
swept O
the O
hearth O
, O
and O
made O
a O
bright O
blazing O
fire O
for O
our O
reception O
; O
the B-PER
servant I-PER
had O
just O
brought O
in O
the O
tea-tray O
; O
and O
Rose B-PER
was O
producing O
the O
sugar-basin O
and O
tea-caddy O
from O
the O
cupboard O
in O
the O
black O
oak O
side-board O
, O
that O
shone O
like O
polished O
ebony O
, O
in O
the O
cheerful O
parlour B-FAC
twilight O
. O
‘ O
Well O
! O
here O
they O
both O
are O
, O
’ O
cried O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
, O
looking O
round O
upon O
us O
without O
retarding O
the O
motion O
of O
her O
nimble O
fingers O
and O
glittering O
needles O
. O
‘ O
Now O
shut O
the O
door O
, O
and O
come O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
while O
Rose B-PER
gets O
the O
tea O
ready O
; O
I O
’m O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
starved O
; O
— O
and O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
’ve O
been O
about O
all O
day O
; O
— O
I O
like O
to O
know O
what O
my B-PER
children I-PER
have O
been O
about O
. O
’ O
‘ O
I O
’ve O
been O
breaking O
in O
the O
grey O
colt O
— O
no O
easy O
business O
that O
— O
directing O
the O
ploughing O
of O
the O
last O
wheat O
stubble O
— O
for O
the B-PER
ploughboy I-PER
has O
not O
the O
sense O
to O
direct O
himself O
— O
and O
carrying O
out O
a O
plan O
for O
the O
extensive O
and O
efficient O
draining O
of O
the B-LOC
low I-LOC
meadowlands I-LOC
. O
’ O
‘ O
That O
’s O
my B-PER
brave I-PER
boy I-PER
! O
— O
and O
Fergus B-PER
, O
what O
have O
you O
been O
doing O
? O
’ O
‘ O
Badger-baiting O
. O
’ O
And O
here O
he O
proceeded O
to O
give O
a O
particular O
account O
of O
his O
sport O
, O
and O
the O
respective O
traits O
of O
prowess O
evinced O
by O
the O
badger O
and O
the O
dogs O
; O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
pretending O
to O
listen O
with O
deep O
attention O
, O
and O
watching O
his O
animated O
countenance O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
maternal O
admiration O
I O
thought O
highly O
disproportioned O
to O
its O
object O
. O
‘ O
It O
’s O
time O
you O
should O
be O
doing O
something O
else O
, O
Fergus B-PER
, O
’ O
said O
I O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
momentary O
pause O
in O
his O
narration O
allowed O
me O
to O
get O
in O
a O
word O
. O
‘ O
What O
can O
I O
do O
? O
’ O
replied O
he O
; O
‘ O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
wo O
n’t O
let O
me O
go O
to O
sea B-LOC

enter O
the B-ORG

and O
I O
’m O
determined O
to O
do O
nothing O

except O
make O
myself O
such O
a O
nuisance O
to O
you O
all O

that O
you O
will O
be O
thankful O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
me O
on O
any O
terms O

’ O
Our B-PER
parent I-PER
soothingly O
stroked O
his O
stiff O
, O
short O
curls O
. O
He O
growled O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
look O
sulky O
, O
and O
then O
we O
all O
took O
our O
seats O
at O
the O
table O
, O
in O
obedience O
to O
the O
thrice-repeated O
summons O
of O
Rose B-PER
. O
‘ O
Now O
take O
your O
tea O

’ O
said O
she O
; O
‘ O

I O
’ll O
tell O
you O
what O
I O

I O

been O
to O
call O
on O
the B-PER
Wilsons I-PER

it O

a O

pities O

did O

go O
with O

Gilbert B-PER

‘ O
Oh O

that O

little I-PER
thing I-PER

when O
she O

my B-PER

earnestly O

holding O
up O
her O

‘ O
Well O

resumed O
Rose B-PER

‘ O
I O

with O
it O

a O
month O

— O
what O
do O
you O
think O

above O
a O
week O

we O
never O

‘ O
Impossible O

my B-PER

‘ O
Preposterous O

Fergus B-PER

‘ O
It O
has O
indeed O

Fergus B-PER

while O
carving O
his O
inch-thick O

of O

butter O

‘ O
Nonsense O

Fergus B-PER

But O
is O

it O
strange O

mamma B-PER

’ O
‘ O
Strange O
! O
I O
can O
hardly O
believe O
it O
. O
’ O
‘ O
But O
you O
may O
believe O
it O
; O
for O
Jane B-PER
Wilson I-PER
has O
seen O
her O
. O
She O
went O
with O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
, O
of O
course O
, O
when O
she O
heard O
of O
a O
stranger O
being O
in O
the B-FAC
neighbourhood I-FAC
, O
would O
be O
on O
pins O
and O
needles O
till O
she O
had O
seen O
her O
and O
got O
all O
she O
could O
out O
of O
her O
. O
She O
is O
called O
Mrs. B-PER
Graham O
, O
and O
she O
is O
in O
mourning O
— O
not O
widow O

weeds O
, O
but O
slightish O
mourning O
— O
and O
she O
is O
quite O
young O
, O
they O
say O
, O
— O
not O
above O
five O
or O
six O
and O
twenty O
, O
— O
but O
so O
reserved O
! O
They O
tried O
all O
they O
could O
to O
find O
out O
who O
she O
was O
and O
where O
she O
came O
from O
, O
and O
, O
all O
about O
her O
, O
but O
neither O
Mrs. B-PER
Wilson I-PER

with O
her O
pertinacious O
and O
impertinent O
home-thrusts O
, O
nor O
Miss B-PER
Wilson I-PER

with O
her O
skilful O
manoeuvring O

elicit O
a O
single O
satisfactory O
answer O
, O

even O
a O
casual O
remark O

the O

ray O
of O
light O
upon O
her O
history O

Moreover O
, O
she O
was O
barely O
civil O
to O
them O

evidently O
better O
pleased O
to O
say O
‘ O
good-by O

But O
Eliza B-PER
Millward I-PER
says O
her B-PER
father I-PER
intends O
to O
call O
upon O
her O
soon O
, O
to O
offer O
some O
pastoral O
advice O
, O
which O
he O
fears O
she O
needs O
, O
as O
, O
though O
she O
is O
known O
to O
have O
entered O
the B-FAC
neighbourhood I-FAC
early O
last O
week O
, O
she O
did O
not O
make O
her O
appearance O
at O
church B-FAC
on O
Sunday O
; O
and O
she O
— O
Eliza B-PER
, O
that O
is O
— O
will O
beg O
to O
accompany O
him O
, O
and O
is O
sure O
she O
can O
succeed O
in O
wheedling O
something O
out O
of O
her O
— O
you O
know O
, O
Gilbert B-PER
, O
she O
can O
do O
anything O
. O
And O
we O
should O
call O
some O
time O
, O
mamma B-PER

it O

only O
proper O

you O
know O

’ O
‘ O
Of O
course O

my O
dear O

Poor O
thing O

How O
lonely O
she O
must O
feel O

’ O
‘ O
And O
pray O
, O
be O
quick O
about O
it O
; O
and O
mind O
you O
bring O
me O
word O
how O
much O
sugar O
she O
puts O
in O
her O
tea O
, O
and O
what O
sort O
of O
caps O

aprons O
she O
wears O
, O
and O
all O
about O
it O
; O
for O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
I O
can O
live O
till O
I O
know O
, O
’ O
said O
Fergus B-PER
, O
very O
gravely O
. O
But O
if O
he O
intended O
the O
speech O
to O
be O
hailed O
as O
a O
master-stroke O
of O
wit O
, O
he O
signally O
failed O
, O
for O
nobody B-PER
laughed O
. O
However O
, O
he O
was O
not O
much O
disconcerted O
at O
that O
; O
for O
when O
he O
had O
taken O
a O
mouthful O
of O
bread O
and O
butter O
and O
was O
about O
to O
swallow O
a O
gulp O
of O
tea O
, O
the O
humour O
of O
the O
thing O
burst O
upon O
him O
with O
such O
irresistible O
force O
, O
that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
jump O
up O
from O
the O
table O
, O
and O
rush O
snorting O
and O
choking O
from O
the B-FAC
room I-FAC
; O
and O
a O
minute O
after O
, O
was O
heard O
screaming O
in O
fearful O
agony O
in O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
. O
As O
for O
me O
, O
I O
was O
hungry O
, O
and O
contented O
myself O
with O
silently O
demolishing O
the O
tea O
, O
ham O
, O
and O
toast O
, O
while O
my B-PER
mother I-PER
and O
sister B-PER
went O
on O
talking O
, O
and O
continued O
to O
discuss O
the O
apparent O
or O
non-apparent O
circumstances O
, O
and O
probable O
or O
improbable O
history O
of O
the B-PER
mysterious I-PER
lady I-PER
; O
but O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
, O
after O
my B-PER
brother I-PER
’s O
misadventure O
, O
I O
once O
or O
twice O
raised O
the O
cup O
to O
my O
lips O
, O
and O
put O
it O
down O
again O
without O
daring O
to O
taste O
the O
contents O
, O
lest O
I O
should O
injure O
my O
dignity O
by O
a O
similar O
explosion O

CHAPTER O
1 O
. O
A O
Not O
Unnatural O
Enterprise O
This O
is O
written O
from O
memory O
, O
unfortunately O
. O
If O
I O
could O
have O
brought O
with O
me O
the O
material O
I O
so O
carefully O
prepared O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
very O
different O
story O
. O
Whole O
books O
full O
of O
notes O
, O
carefully O
copied O
records O
, O
firsthand O
descriptions O
, O
and O
the O
pictures O
-- O
that O
’s O
the O
worst O
loss O
. O
We O
had O
some O
bird O
’s O
- O
eyes O
of O
the B-GPE
cities I-GPE
and O
parks B-FAC
; O
a O
lot O
of O
lovely O
views O
of O
streets B-FAC
, O
of O
buildings B-FAC
, O
outside O
and O
in O
, O
and O
some O
of O
those B-FAC
gorgeous I-FAC
gardens I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
most O
important O
of O
all O
, O
of O
the B-PER
women I-PER
themselves O
. O
Nobody B-PER
will O
ever O
believe O
how O
they O
looked O
. O
Descriptions O
are O
n’t O
any O
good O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
women B-PER
, O
and O
I O
never O
was O
good O
at O
descriptions O
anyhow O
. O
But O
it O
’s O
got O
to O
be O
done O
somehow O
; O
the O
rest O
of O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
needs O
to O
know O
about O
that B-GPE
country I-GPE
. O
I O
have O
n’t O
said O
where O
it O
was O
for O
fear O
some B-PER
self-appointed I-PER
missionaries I-PER
, O
or O
traders B-PER
, O
or O
land-greedy B-PER
expansionists I-PER
, O
will O
take O
it O
upon O
themselves O
to O
push O
in O
. O
They O
will O
not O
be O
wanted O
, O
I O
can O
tell O
them O
that O
, O
and O
will O
fare O
worse O
than O
we O
did O
if O
they O
do O
find O
it O
. O
It O
began O
this O
way O
. O
There O
were O
three O
of O
us O
, O
classmates B-PER
and O
friends B-PER
-- O
Terry B-PER
O. I-PER
Nicholson I-PER
( O
we O
used O
to O
call O
him O
the O
Old B-PER
Nick I-PER
, O
with O
good O
reason O
) O
, O
Jeff B-PER
Margrave I-PER
, O
and O
I O
, O
Vandyck B-PER
Jennings I-PER
. O
We O
had O
known O
each O
other O
years O
and O
years O
, O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
our O
differences O
we O
had O
a O
good O
deal O
in O
common O
. O
All O
of O
us O
were O
interested O
in O
science O
. O
Terry B-PER
was O
rich O
enough O
to O
do O
as O
he O
pleased O
. O
His O
great O
aim O
was O
exploration O
. O
He O
used O
to O
make O
all O
kinds O
of O
a O
row O
because O
there O
was O
nothing O
left O
to O
explore O

He O
filled O

well O
enough O
-- O
he O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
talents O
-- O
great O
on O
mechanics O
and O
electricity O
. O
Had O
all O
kinds O
of O
boats B-VEH
and O
motorcars B-VEH
, O
and O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
of O
our B-PER
airmen I-PER
. O
We O
never O
could O
have O
done O
the O
thing O
at O
all O
without O
Terry B-PER
. O
Jeff B-PER
Margrave I-PER
was O
born O
to O
be O
a B-PER
poet I-PER
, O
a B-PER
botanist I-PER
-- O
or O
both O
-- O
but O
his B-PER
folks I-PER
persuaded O
him O
to O
be O
a B-PER
doctor I-PER
instead O
. O
He O
was O
a O
good O
one O
, O
for O
his O
age O
, O
but O
his O
real O
interest O
was O
in O
what O
he O
loved O
to O
call O
“ O
the O
wonders O
of O
science O
. O
” O
As O
for O
me O
, O
sociology O
’s O
my O
major O
. O
You O
have O
to O
back O
that O
up O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
sciences O
, O
of O
course O
. O
I O
’m O
interested O
in O
them O
all O
. O
Terry B-PER
was O
strong O
on O
facts O
-- O
geography O
and O
meteorology O
and O
those O
; O
Jeff B-PER
could O
beat O
him O
any O
time O
on O
biology O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n’t O
care O
what O
it O
was O
they O
talked O
about O
, O
so O
long O
as O
it O
connected O
with O
human O
life O
, O
somehow O
. O
There O
are O
few O
things O
that O
do O
n’t O
. O
We O
three O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
join O
a O
big O
scientific O
expedition O
. O
They O
needed O
a B-PER
doctor I-PER
, O
and O
that O
gave O
Jeff B-PER
an O
excuse O
for O
dropping O
his O
just O
opening O
practice O
; O
they O
needed O
Terry B-PER
’s O
experience O
, O
his O
machine O
, O
and O
his O
money O
; O
and O
as O
for O
me O
, O
I O
got O
in O
through O
Terry B-PER
’s O
influence O
. O
The O
expedition O
was O
up O
among O
the O
thousand O
tributaries O
and O
enormous O
hinterland O
of O
a B-LOC
great I-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
up O
where O
the O
maps O
had O
to O
be O
made O
, O
savage O
dialects O
studied O
, O
and O
all O
manner O
of O
strange O
flora O
and O
fauna O
expected O
. O
But O
this O
story O
is O
not O
about O
that O
expedition O
. O
That O
was O
only O
the O
merest O
starter O
for O
ours O
. O
My O
interest O
was O
first O
roused O
by O
talk O
among O
our B-PER
guides I-PER
. O
I O
’m O
quick O
at O
languages O
, O
know O
a O
good O
many O
, O
and O
pick O
them O
up O
readily O
. O
What O
with O
that O
and O
a B-PER
really I-PER
good I-PER
interpreter I-PER
we I-PER
took I-PER
with I-PER
us I-PER
, O
I O
made O
out O
quite O
a O
few O
legends O
and O
folk O
myths O
of O
these B-PER
scattered I-PER
tribes I-PER
. O
And O
as O
we O
got O
farther O
and O
farther O
upstream O
, O
in O
a O
dark O
tangle O
of O
rivers B-LOC
, O
lakes B-LOC
, O
morasses B-LOC
, O
and O
dense B-LOC
forests I-LOC
, O
with O
here O
and O
there O
an O
unexpected O
long O
spur O
running O
out O
from O
the B-LOC
big I-LOC
mountains I-LOC
beyond I-LOC
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
more O
and O
more O
of O
these B-PER
savages I-PER
had O
a O
story O
about O
a B-GPE
strange I-GPE
and I-GPE
terrible I-GPE
Woman I-GPE
Land I-GPE
in I-GPE
the I-GPE
high I-GPE
distance I-GPE
. O
“ O
Up O
yonder O
, O
” O
“ O
Over O
there O
, O
” O
“ O
Way O
up O
” O
-- O
was O
all O
the O
direction O
they O
could O
offer O
, O
but O
their O
legends O
all O
agreed O
on O
the O
main O
point O
-- O
that O
there O
was O
this O
strange O
country O
where O
no O
men B-PER
lived O
-- O
only O
women B-PER
and O
girl B-PER
children I-PER
. O
None O
of O
them O
had O
ever O
seen O
it O
. O
It O
was O
dangerous O
, O
deadly O
, O
they O
said O
, O
for O
any B-PER
man I-PER
to O
go O
there B-LOC
. O
But O
there O
were O
tales O
of O
long O
ago O
, O
when O
some B-PER
brave I-PER
investigator I-PER
had O
seen O
it O
-- O
a B-LOC
Big I-LOC
Country I-LOC
, O
Big B-FAC
Houses I-FAC
, O
Plenty B-PER
People I-PER
-- O
All B-PER
Women I-PER
. O
Had O
no B-PER
one I-PER
else I-PER
gone O
? O
Yes O
-- O
a O
good O
many O
-- O
but O
they O
never O
came O
back O
. O
It O
was O
no O
place O
for O
men B-PER
-- O
of O
that O
they O
seemed O
sure O
. O
I O
told O
the B-PER
boys I-PER
about O
these O
stories O
, O
and O
they O
laughed O
at O
them O
. O
Naturally O
I O
did O
myself O
. O
I O
knew O
the O
stuff O
that O
savage O
dreams O
are O
made O
of O
. O
But O
when O
we O
had O
reached O
our O
farthest O
point O
, O
just O
the O
day O
before O
we O
all O
had O
to O
turn O
around O
and O
start O
for O
home B-FAC
again O
, O
as O
the O
best O
of O
expeditions O
must O
in O
time O
, O
we O
three O
made O
a O
discovery O
. O
The B-FAC
main I-FAC
encampment I-FAC
was O
on O
a O
spit O
of O
land O
running O
out O
into O
the B-LOC
main I-LOC
stream I-LOC
, O
or O
what O
we O
thought O
was O
the B-LOC
main I-LOC
stream I-LOC
. O
It O
had O
the O
same O
muddy O
color O
we O
had O
been O
seeing O
for O
weeks O
past O
, O
the O
same O
taste O
. O
I O
happened O
to O
speak O
of O
that B-LOC
river I-LOC
to O
our B-PER
last I-PER
guide I-PER
, O
a B-PER
rather I-PER
superior I-PER
fellow I-PER
with I-PER
quick I-PER
, I-PER
bright I-PER
eyes I-PER
. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
there O
was O
another B-LOC
river I-LOC
-- O
“ O
over O
there O
, O
short B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
sweet O
water O
, O
red O
and O
blue O
. O
” O
I O
was O
interested O
in O
this O
and O
anxious O
to O
see O
if O
I O
had O
understood O
, O
so O
I O
showed O
him O
a O
red O
and O
blue O
pencil O
I O
carried O
, O
and O
asked O
again O
. O
Yes O
, O
he O
pointed O
to O
the B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
and O
then O
to O
the O
southwestward O
. O
“ O
River B-LOC
-- O
good O
water O
-- O
red O
and O
blue O
. O
” O
Terry B-PER
was O
close O
by O
and O
interested O
in O
the B-PER
fellow I-PER
’s O
pointing O
. O
“ O
What O
does O
he O
say O
, O
Van B-PER
? O
” O
I O
told O
him O
. O
Terry B-PER
blazed O
up O
at O
once O
. O
“ O
Ask O
him O
how O
far O
it O
is O
. O
” O
The B-PER
man I-PER
indicated O
a O
short O
journey O
; O
I O
judged O
about O
two O
hours O
, O
maybe O
three O
. O
“ O
Let O
’s O
go O
, O
” O
urged O
Terry B-PER
. O
“ O
Just O
us O
three O
. O
Maybe O
we O
can O
really O
find O
something O
. O
May O
be O
cinnabar O
in O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
May O
be O
indigo O
, O
” O
Jeff B-PER
suggested O
, O
with O
his O
lazy O
smile O
. O
It O
was O
early O
yet O
; O
we O
had O
just O
breakfasted O
; O
and O
leaving O
word O
that O
we O
’d O
be O
back O
before O
night O
, O
we O
got O
away O
quietly O
, O
not O
wishing O
to O
be O
thought O
too O
gullible O
if O
we O
failed O
, O
and O
secretly O
hoping O
to O
have O
some O
nice O
little O
discovery O
all O
to O
ourselves O
. O
It O
was O
a O
long O
two O
hours O
, O
nearer O
three O
. O
I O
fancy O
the B-PER
savage I-PER
could O
have O
done O
it O
alone O
much O
quicker O
. O
There O
was O
a B-LOC
desperate I-LOC
tangle I-LOC
of I-LOC
wood I-LOC
and I-LOC
water I-LOC
and O
a B-LOC
swampy I-LOC
patch I-LOC
we I-LOC
never I-LOC
should I-LOC
have I-LOC
found I-LOC
our I-LOC
way I-LOC
across I-LOC
alone I-LOC
. O
But O
there O
was O
one O
, O
and O
I O
could O
see O
Terry B-PER
, O
with O
compass O
and O
notebook O
, O
marking O
directions O
and O
trying O
to O
place O
landmarks O
. O
We O
came O
after O
a O
while O
to O
a B-LOC
sort I-LOC
of I-LOC
marshy I-LOC
lake I-LOC
, O
very O
big O
, O
so O
that O
the B-LOC
circling I-LOC
forest I-LOC
looked O
quite O
low O
and O
dim O
across O
it O
. O
Our B-PER
guide I-PER
told O
us O
that O
boats B-VEH
could O
go O
from O
there B-LOC
to O
our B-FAC
camp I-FAC
-- O
but O
“ O
long O
way O
-- O
all O
day O
. O
” O
This O
water O
was O
somewhat O
clearer O
than O
that O
we O
had O
left O
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
judge O
well O
from O
the O
margin O
. O
We O
skirted O
it O
for O
another O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
, O
the O
ground O
growing O
firmer O
as O
we O
advanced O
, O
and O
presently O
we O
turned O
the O
corner O
of O
a B-LOC
wooded I-LOC
promontory I-LOC
and O
saw O
a B-LOC
quite I-LOC
different I-LOC
country I-LOC
-- O
a O
sudden O
view O
of O
mountains B-LOC
, I-LOC
steep I-LOC
and I-LOC
bare I-LOC
. O
“ O
One B-LOC
of I-LOC
those I-LOC
long I-LOC
easterly I-LOC
spurs I-LOC
, O
” O
Terry B-PER
said O
appraisingly O
. O
“ O
May O
be O
hundreds O
of O
miles O
from O
the O
range O
. O
They O
crop O
out O
like O
that O
. O
” O
Suddenly O
we O
left O
the B-LOC
lake I-LOC
and O
struck O
directly O
toward O
the B-LOC
cliffs I-LOC
. O
We O
heard O
running O
water O
before O
we O
reached O
it O
, O
and O
the B-PER
guide I-PER
pointed O
proudly O
to O
his B-LOC
river I-LOC
. O
It O
was O
short O
. O
We O
could O
see O
where O
it O
poured O
down O
a O
narrow O
vertical O
cataract O
from O
an O
opening O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the B-LOC
cliff I-LOC
. O
It O
was O
sweet O
water O
. O
The B-PER
guide I-PER
drank O
eagerly O
and O
so O
did O
we O
. O
“ O
That O
’s O
snow O
water O
, O
” O
Terry B-PER
announced O
. O
“ O
Must O
come O
from O
way O
back O
in O
the B-LOC
hills I-LOC
. O
” O
But O
as O
to O
being O
red O
and O
blue O
-- O
it O
was O
greenish O
in O
tint O
. O
The B-PER
guide I-PER
seemed O
not O
at O
all O
surprised O
. O
He O
hunted O
about O
a O
little O
and O
showed O
us O
a B-LOC
quiet I-LOC
marginal I-LOC
pool I-LOC
where I-LOC
there I-LOC
were I-LOC
smears I-LOC
of I-LOC
red I-LOC
along I-LOC
the I-LOC
border I-LOC
; O
yes O
, O
and O
of O
blue O
. O
Terry B-PER
got O
out O
his O
magnifying O
glass O
and O
squatted O
down O
to O
investigate O
. O
“ O
Chemicals O
of O
some O
sort O
-- O
I O
ca O
n’t O
tell O
on O
the O
spot O
. O
Look O
to O
me O
like O
dyestuffs O
. O
Let O
’s O
get O
nearer O
, O
” O
he O
urged O
, O
“ O
up O
there O
by O
the B-LOC
fall I-LOC
. O
” O
We O
scrambled O
along O
the B-LOC
steep I-LOC
banks I-LOC
and O
got O
close O
to O
the B-LOC
pool I-LOC
that I-LOC
foamed I-LOC
and I-LOC
boiled I-LOC
beneath I-LOC
the I-LOC
falling I-LOC
water I-LOC
. O
Here B-LOC
we O
searched O
the O
border O
and O
found O
traces O
of O
color O
beyond O
dispute O
. O
More O
-- O
Jeff O
suddenly O
held O
up O
an O
unlooked-for O
trophy O
. O
It O
was O
only O
a O
rag O
, O
a O
long O
, O
raveled O
fragment O
of O
cloth O
. O
But O
it O
was O
a O
well-woven O
fabric O
, O
with O
a O
pattern O
, O
and O
of O
a O
clear O
scarlet O
that O
the O
water O
had O
not O
faded O
. O
No O
savage O
tribe O
that O
we O
had O
heard O
of O
made O
such O
fabrics O
. O
The B-PER
guide I-PER
stood O
serenely O
on O
the B-LOC
bank I-LOC
, O
well O
pleased O
with O
our O
excitement O
. O
“ O
One O
day O
blue O
-- O
one O
day O
red O
-- O
one O
day O
green O
, O
” O
he O
told O
us O
, O
and O
pulled O
from O
his O
pouch O
another O
strip O
of O
bright-hued O
cloth O
. O
“ O
Come O
down O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
pointing O
to O
the B-LOC
cataract I-LOC
. O
“ O
Woman B-GPE
Country I-GPE
-- O
up O
there O
. O
” O
Then O
we O
were O
interested O
. O
We O
had O
our O
rest O
and O
lunch O
right O
there B-LOC
and O
pumped O
the B-PER
man I-PER
for O
further O
information O
. O
He O
could O
tell O
us O
only O
what O
the O
others O
had O
-- O
a O
land O
of O
women B-PER
-- O
no B-PER
men I-PER
-- O
babies O
, O
but O
all B-PER
girls I-PER
. O
No O
place O
for O
men B-PER
-- O
dangerous O
. O
Some O
had O
gone O
to O
see O
-- O
none O
had O
come O
back O
. O
I O
could O
see O
Terry B-PER
’s O
jaw O
set O
at O
that O
. O
No O
place O
for O
men B-PER
? O
Dangerous O
? O
He O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
might O
shin O
up O
the B-LOC
waterfall I-LOC
on O
the O
spot O
. O
But O
the B-PER
guide I-PER
would O
not O
hear O
of O
going O
up O
, O
even O
if O
there O
had O
been O
any O
possible O
method O
of O
scaling O
that B-LOC
sheer I-LOC
cliff I-LOC
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
get O
back O
to O
our B-PER
party I-PER
before O
night O
. O
“ O
They O
might O
stay O
if O
we O
told O
them O
, O
” O
I O
suggested O
. O
But O
Terry B-PER
stopped O
in O
his O
tracks O
. O
“ O
Look O
here O
, O
fellows B-PER
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
This O
is O
our O
find O
. O
Let O
’s O
not O
tell O
those B-PER
cocky I-PER
old I-PER
professors I-PER

Let O

go O
on O
home B-FAC
