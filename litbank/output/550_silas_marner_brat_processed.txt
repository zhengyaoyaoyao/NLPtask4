CHAPTER O
I O
In O
the O
days O
when O
the O
spinning-wheels O
hummed O
busily O
in O
the B-FAC
farmhouses I-FAC
-- O
and O
even O
great B-PER
ladies I-PER
, I-PER
clothed I-PER
in I-PER
silk I-PER
and I-PER
thread-lace I-PER
, O
had O
their O
toy O
spinning-wheels O
of O
polished O
oak O
-- O
there O
might O
be O
seen O
in O
districts O
far O
away O
among O
the B-FAC
lanes I-FAC
, O
or O
deep O
in O
the O
bosom O
of O
the B-LOC
hills I-LOC
, O
certain O
pallid O
undersized O
men O
, O
who O
, O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the B-PER
brawny I-PER
country-folk I-PER
, O
looked O
like O
the O
remnants O
of O
a B-PER
disinherited I-PER
race I-PER
. O
The B-PER
shepherd I-PER
's O
dog O
barked O
fiercely O
when O
one O
of O
these B-PER
alien-looking I-PER
men I-PER
appeared O
on O
the B-LOC
upland I-LOC
, O
dark O
against O
the O
early O
winter O
sunset O
; O
for O
what O
dog O
likes O
a B-PER
figure I-PER
bent I-PER
under I-PER
a I-PER
heavy I-PER
bag I-PER
? O
-- O
and O
these B-PER
pale I-PER
men I-PER
rarely O
stirred O
abroad O
without O
that O
mysterious O
burden O
. O
The B-PER
shepherd I-PER
himself O
, O
though O
he O
had O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
bag O
held O
nothing O
but O
flaxen O
thread O
, O
or O
else O
the O
long O
rolls O
of O
strong O
linen O
spun O
from O
that O
thread O
, O
was O
not O
quite O
sure O
that O
this O
trade O
of O
weaving O
, O
indispensable O
though O
it O
was O
, O
could O
be O
carried O
on O
entirely O
without O
the O
help O
of O
the B-PER
Evil I-PER
One I-PER
. O
In O
that O
far-off O
time O
superstition O
clung O
easily O
round O
every B-PER
person I-PER
or O
thing O
that O
was O
at O
all O
unwonted O
, O
or O
even O
intermittent O
and O
occasional O
merely O
, O
like O
the O
visits O
of O
the B-PER
pedlar I-PER
or O
the B-PER
knife-grinder I-PER
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
knew O
where O
wandering B-PER
men I-PER
had O
their B-FAC
homes I-FAC
or O
their O
origin O
; O
and O
how O
was O
a B-PER
man I-PER
to O
be O
explained O
unless O
you O
at O
least O
knew O
somebody O
who O
knew O
his B-PER
father I-PER
and O
mother B-PER
? O
To O
the B-PER
peasants I-PER
of I-PER
old I-PER
times I-PER
, O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
outside I-LOC
their I-LOC
own I-LOC
direct I-LOC
experience I-LOC
was O
a B-LOC
region I-LOC
of I-LOC
vagueness I-LOC
and I-LOC
mystery I-LOC
: O
to O
their O
untravelled O
thought O
a O
state O
of O
wandering O
was O
a O
conception O
as O
dim O
as O
the O
winter O
life O
of O
the O
swallows O
that O
came O
back O
with O
the O
spring O
; O
and O
even B-PER
a I-PER
settler I-PER
, O
if O
he O
came O
from O
distant B-LOC
parts I-LOC
, O
hardly O
ever O
ceased O
to O
be O
viewed O
with O
a O
remnant O
of O
distrust O
, O
which O
would O
have O
prevented O
any O
surprise O
if O
a O
long O
course O
of O
inoffensive O
conduct O
on O
his O
part O
had O
ended O
in O
the O
commission O
of O
a O
crime O
; O
especially O
if O
he O
had O
any O
reputation O
for O
knowledge O
, O
or O
showed O
any O
skill O
in O
handicraft O
. O
All O
cleverness O
, O
whether O
in O
the O
rapid O
use O
of O
that O
difficult O
instrument O
the O
tongue O
, O
or O
in O
some O
other O
art O
unfamiliar O
to O
villagers B-PER
, O
was O
in O
itself O
suspicious O
: O
honest B-PER
folk I-PER
, I-PER
born I-PER
and I-PER
bred I-PER
in I-PER
a I-PER
visible I-PER
manner I-PER
, O
were O
mostly O
not O
overwise O
or O
clever O
-- O
at O
least O
, O
not O
beyond O
such O
a O
matter O
as O
knowing O
the O
signs O
of O
the O
weather O
; O
and O
the O
process O
by O
which O
rapidity O
and O
dexterity O
of O
any O
kind O
were O
acquired O
was O
so O
wholly O
hidden O
, O
that O
they O
partook O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
conjuring O
. O
In O
this O
way O
it O
came O
to O
pass O
that O
those B-PER
scattered I-PER
linen-weavers I-PER
-- O
emigrants O
from O
the B-GPE
town I-GPE
into O
the B-LOC
country I-LOC
-- O
were O
to O
the B-PER
last I-PER
regarded O
as O
aliens B-PER
by O
their B-PER
rustic I-PER
neighbours I-PER
, O
and O
usually O
contracted O
the O
eccentric O
habits O
which O
belong O
to O
a O
state O
of O
loneliness O
. O
In O
the O
early O
years O
of O
this O
century O
, O
such B-PER
a I-PER
linen-weaver I-PER
, O
named O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
, O
worked O
at O
his O
vocation O
in O
a O
stone O
cottage O
that O
stood O
among O
the B-LOC
nutty I-LOC
hedgerows I-LOC
near O
the B-GPE
village I-GPE
of I-GPE
Raveloe I-GPE
, O
and O
not O
far O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
a B-LOC
deserted I-LOC
stone-pit I-LOC
. O
The O
questionable O
sound O
of O
Silas B-PER
's O
loom O
, O
so O
unlike O
the O
natural O
cheerful O
trotting O
of O
the O
winnowing-machine O
, O
or O
the O
simpler O
rhythm O
of O
the O
flail O
, O
had O
a O
half-fearful O
fascination O
for O
the O
Raveloe O
boys O
, O
who O
would O
often O
leave O
off O
their O
nutting O
or O
birds O
' O
- O
nesting O
to O
peep O
in O
at O
the O
window O
of O
the B-FAC
stone I-FAC
cottage I-FAC
, O
counterbalancing O
a O
certain O
awe O
at O
the O
mysterious O
action O
of O
the O
loom O
, O
by O
a O
pleasant O
sense O
of O
scornful O
superiority O
, O
drawn O
from O
the O
mockery O
of O
its O
alternating O
noises O
, O
along O
with O
the O
bent O
, O
tread-mill O
attitude O
of O
the B-PER
weaver I-PER
. O
But O
sometimes O
it O
happened O
that O
Marner B-PER
, O
pausing O
to O
adjust O
an O
irregularity O
in O
his O
thread O
, O
became O
aware O
of O
the B-PER
small I-PER
scoundrels I-PER
, O
and O
, O
though O
chary O
of O
his O
time O
, O
he O
liked O
their O
intrusion O
so O
ill O
that O
he O
would O
descend O
from O
his O
loom O
, O
and O
, O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
would O
fix O
on O
them O
a O
gaze O
that O
was O
always O
enough O
to O
make O
them O
take O
to O
their O
legs O
in O
terror O
. O
For O
how O
was O
it O
possible O
to O
believe O
that O
those O
large O
brown O
protuberant O
eyes O
in O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
's O
pale O
face O
really O
saw O
nothing O
very O
distinctly O
that O
was O
not O
close O
to O
them O
, O
and O
not O
rather O
that O
their O
dreadful O
stare O
could O
dart O
cramp O
, O
or O
rickets O
, O
or O
a O
wry O
mouth O
at O
any B-PER
boy I-PER
who I-PER
happened I-PER
to I-PER
be I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
rear I-PER
? O
They O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
heard O
their B-PER
fathers I-PER
and O
mothers B-PER
hint O
that O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
could O
cure O
folks B-PER
' O
rheumatism O
if O
he O
had O
a O
mind O
, O
and O
add O
, O
still O
more O
darkly O
, O
that O
if O
you O
could O
only O
speak O
the B-PER
devil I-PER
fair O
enough O
, O
he O
might O
save O
you O
the O
cost O
of O
the B-PER
doctor I-PER
. O
Such O
strange O
lingering O
echoes O
of O
the O
old O
demon-worship O
might O
perhaps O
even O
now O
be O
caught O
by O
the B-PER
diligent I-PER
listener I-PER
among O
the B-PER
grey-haired I-PER
peasantry I-PER
; O
for O
the O
rude O
mind O
with O
difficulty O
associates O
the O
ideas O
of O
power O
and O
benignity O
. O
A O
shadowy O
conception O
of O
power O
that O
by O
much O
persuasion O
can O
be O
induced O
to O
refrain O
from O
inflicting O
harm O
, O
is O
the O
shape O
most O
easily O
taken O
by O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
Invisible O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
men B-PER
who I-PER
have I-PER
always I-PER
been I-PER
pressed I-PER
close I-PER
by I-PER
primitive I-PER
wants I-PER
, I-PER
and I-PER
to I-PER
whom I-PER
a I-PER
life I-PER
of I-PER
hard I-PER
toil I-PER
has I-PER
never I-PER
been I-PER
illuminated I-PER
by I-PER
any I-PER
enthusiastic I-PER
religious I-PER
faith I-PER
. O
To O
them O
pain O
and O
mishap O
present O
a O
far O
wider O
range O
of O
possibilities O
than O
gladness O
and O
enjoyment O
: O
their O
imagination O
is O
almost O
barren O
of O
the O
images O
that O
feed O
desire O
and O
hope O
, O
but O
is O
all O
overgrown O
by O
recollections O
that O
are O
a O
perpetual O
pasture O
to O
fear O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
anything O
you O
can O
fancy O
that O
you O
would O
like O
to O
eat O
? O
" O
I O
once O
said O
to O
an O
old O
labouring O
man O
, O
who O
was O
in O
his O
last O
illness O
, O
and O
who O
had O
refused O
all O
the O
food O
his B-PER
wife I-PER
had O
offered O
him O
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
" O
I O
've O
never O
been O
used O
to O
nothing O
but O
common O
victual O
, O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
eat O
that O
. O
" O
Experience O
had O
bred O
no O
fancies O
in O
him O
that O
could O
raise O
the O
phantasm O
of O
appetite O
. O
And O
Raveloe B-GPE
was O
a B-GPE
village I-GPE
where I-GPE
many I-GPE
of I-GPE
the I-GPE
old I-GPE
echoes I-GPE
lingered I-GPE
, I-GPE
undrowned I-GPE
by I-GPE
new I-GPE
voices I-GPE
. O
Not O
that O
it O
was O
one O
of O
those B-FAC
barren I-FAC
parishes I-FAC
lying I-FAC
on I-FAC
the I-FAC
outskirts I-FAC
of I-FAC
civilization I-FAC
-- O
inhabited O
by O
meagre O
sheep O
and O
thinly-scattered B-PER
shepherds I-PER
: O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
lay O
in O
the O
rich O
central O
plain O
of O
what O
we O
are O
pleased O
to O
call O
Merry B-GPE
England I-GPE
, O
and O
held O
farms B-FAC
which I-FAC
, I-FAC
speaking I-FAC
from I-FAC
a I-FAC
spiritual I-FAC
point I-FAC
of I-FAC
view I-FAC
, I-FAC
paid I-FAC
highly-desirable I-FAC
tithes I-FAC
. O
But O
it O
was O
nestled O
in O
a O
snug O
well-wooded O
hollow O
, O
quite O
an O
hour O
's O
journey O
on O
horseback O
from O
any B-FAC
turnpike I-FAC
, O
where O
it O
was O
never O
reached O
by O
the O
vibrations O
of O
the O
coach-horn O
, O
or O
of O
public O
opinion O
. O
It O
was O
an O
important-looking O
village O
, O
with O
a B-FAC
fine I-FAC
old I-FAC
church I-FAC
and I-FAC
large I-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
in I-FAC
the I-FAC
heart I-FAC
of I-FAC
it I-FAC
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
large O
brick-and-stone O
homesteads O
, O
with O
well-walled B-FAC
orchards I-FAC
and O
ornamental O
weathercocks O
, O
standing O
close O
upon O
the B-FAC
road I-FAC
, O
and O
lifting O
more O
imposing O
fronts O
than O
the O
rectory O
, O
which O
peeped O
from O
among O
the O
trees O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
: O
-- O
a O
village O
which O
showed O
at O
once O
the O
summits O
of O
its O
social O
life O
, O
and O
told O
the O
practised O
eye O
that O
there O
was O
no O
great B-FAC
park I-FAC
and O
manor-house B-FAC
in O
the B-LOC
vicinity I-LOC
, O
but O
that O
there O
were O
several O
chiefs O
in O
Raveloe B-GPE
who O
could O
farm O
badly O
quite O
at O
their O
ease O
, O
drawing O
enough O
money O
from O
their O
bad O
farming O
, O
in O
those O
war O
times O
, O
to O
live O
in O
a O
rollicking O
fashion O
, O
and O
keep O
a O
jolly O
Christmas O
, O
Whitsun O
, O
and O
Easter O
tide O
. O
It O
was O
fifteen O
years O
since O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
had O
first O
come O
to O
Raveloe B-GPE
; O
he O
was O
then O
simply O
a O
pallid O
young O
man O
, O
with O
prominent O
short-sighted O
brown O
eyes O
, O
whose O
appearance O
would O
have O
had O
nothing O
strange O
for O
people B-PER
of I-PER
average I-PER
culture I-PER
and I-PER
experience I-PER
, O
but O
for O
the B-PER
villagers I-PER
near I-PER
whom I-PER
he I-PER
had I-PER
come I-PER
to I-PER
settle I-PER
it O
had O
mysterious O
peculiarities O
which O
corresponded O
with O
the O
exceptional O
nature O
of O
his O
occupation O
, O
and O
his O
advent O
from O
an O
unknown O
region O
called O
" O
North B-LOC
' I-LOC
ard I-LOC
" O
. O
So O
had O
his O
way O
of O
life O
: O
-- O
he O
invited O
no B-PER
comer I-PER
to O
step O
across O
his O
door-sill O
, O
and O
he O
never O
strolled O
into O
the B-GPE
village I-GPE
to O
drink O
a O
pint O
at O
the B-FAC
Rainbow I-FAC
, O
or O
to O
gossip O
at O
the B-PER
wheelwright I-PER
's O
: O
he O
sought O
no B-PER
man I-PER
or O
woman B-PER
, O
save O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
his O
calling O
, O
or O
in O
order O
to O
supply O
himself O
with O
necessaries O
; O
and O
it O
was O
soon O
clear O
to O
the O
Raveloe B-GPE
lasses O
that O
he O
would O
never O
urge O
one O
of O
them O
to O
accept O
him O
against O
her O
will O
-- O
quite O
as O
if O
he O
had O
heard O
them O
declare O
that O
they O
would O
never O
marry O
a B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
come O
to O
life O
again O
. O
This O
view O
of O
Marner B-PER
's O
personality O
was O
not O
without O
another O
ground O
than O
his O
pale O
face O
and O
unexampled O
eyes O
; O
for O
Jem B-PER
Rodney I-PER
, O
the B-PER
mole-catcher I-PER
, O
averred O
that O
one O
evening O
as O
he O
was O
returning O
homeward O
, O
he O
saw O
Silas B-PER
Marner I-PER
leaning O
against O
a O
stile O
with O
a O
heavy O
bag O
on O
his O
back O
, O
instead O
of O
resting O
the O
bag O
on O
the O
stile O
as O
a B-PER
man I-PER
in I-PER
his I-PER
senses I-PER
would O
have O
done O
; O
and O
that O
, O
on O
coming O
up O
to O
him O
, O
he O
saw O
that O
Marner B-PER
's O
eyes O
were O
set O
like O
a B-PER
dead I-PER
man I-PER
's O
, O
and O
he O
spoke O
to O
him O
, O
and O
shook O
him O
, O
and O
his O
limbs O
were O
stiff O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
clutched O
the O
bag O
as O
if O
they O
'd O
been O
made O
of O
iron O
; O
but O
just O
as O
he O
had O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
that O
the B-PER
weaver I-PER
was O
dead O
, O
he O
came O
all O
right O
again O
, O
like O
, O
as O
you O
might O
say O
, O
in O
the O
winking O
of O
an O
eye O
, O
and O
said O
" O
Good-night O
" O
, O
and O
walked O
off O
. O
All O
this O
Jem B-PER
swore O
he O
had O
seen O
, O
more O
by O
token O
that O
it O
was O
the O
very O
day O
he O
had O
been O
mole-catching O
on O
Squire B-PER
Cass I-PER
's O
land O
, O
down O
by O
the B-FAC
old I-FAC
saw-pit I-FAC
. O
Some O
said O
Marner B-PER
must O
have O
been O
in O
a O
" O
fit O
" O
, O
a O
word O
which O
seemed O
to O
explain O
things O
otherwise O
incredible O
; O
but O
the B-PER
argumentative I-PER
Mr. I-PER
Macey I-PER
, O
clerk O
of O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
, O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
and O
asked O
if O
anybody B-PER
was O
ever O
known O
to O
go O
off O
in O
a O
fit O
and O
not O
fall O
down O
. O
A O
fit O
was O
a O
stroke O
, O
was O
n't O
it O
? O
and O
it O
was O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
stroke O
to O
partly O
take O
away O
the O
use O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
's O
limbs O
and O
throw O
him O
on O
the B-FAC
parish I-FAC
, O
if O
he O
'd O
got O
no B-PER
children I-PER
to O
look O
to O
. O
No O
, O
no O
; O
it O
was O
no O
stroke O
that O
would O

a B-PER
man I-PER
stand O
on O
his O

then O
walk O
off O
as O
soon O
as O

such O
a O

a B-PER
man I-PER

soul O
being O
loose O
from O
his O
body O
, O
and O
going O
out O

in O
, O
like O
a O
bird O
out O

back O
; O
and O
that O

how O

to O

this O
shell-less O
state O
to O
those O
who O

more O
than O
their B-PER

with O
their O
five O

the B-PER

He O
might O
cure O
more O
folks B-PER
