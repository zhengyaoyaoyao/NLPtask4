In O

one O
of O
those O

indent O
the O
eastern O
shore O
of O
the B-LOC

ancient I-PER

the B-LOC

where O

shortened O

and O
implored O
the O
protection O
of O
St. B-PER
Nicholas O
when O
they O
crossed O

there O
lies O
a B-GPE
small I-GPE
market I-GPE
town I-GPE
or O
rural B-GPE
port I-GPE

which O
by O
some O
is O
called O
Greensburgh B-GPE

but O
which O
is O
more O
generally O
and O
properly O
known O
by O
the O
name O
of O
Tarry B-GPE
Town I-GPE

This O
name O
was O
given O
, O
we O
are O
told O
, O
in O
former O
days O
, O
by O
the O
good O
housewives O
of O
the B-LOC
adjacent I-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
from O
the O
inveterate O
propensity O
of O
their B-PER
husbands I-PER
to O
linger O
about O
the O
village B-GPE
tavern O
on O
market O
days O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
I O
do O
not O
vouch O
for O
the O
fact O
, O
but O
merely O
advert O
to O
it O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
being O
precise O
and O
authentic O
. O
Not O
far O
from O
this B-GPE
village I-GPE
, O
perhaps O
about O
two O
miles O
, O
there O
is O
a B-LOC
little I-LOC
valley I-LOC
or O
rather O
lap O
of O
land O
among O
high B-LOC
hills I-LOC

which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
quietest O
places O
in O
the B-LOC
whole I-LOC
world I-LOC

A B-LOC
small I-LOC
brook I-LOC
glides O
through O
it O
, O
with O
just O
murmur O
enough O
to O
lull O
one O
to O
repose O
; O
and O
the O
occasional O
whistle O
of O
a O
quail O
or O
tapping O
of O
a O
woodpecker O
is O
almost O
the O
only O
sound O
that O
ever O
breaks O
in O
upon O
the O
uniform O
tranquillity O
. O
I O
recollect O
that O
, O
when O
a B-PER
stripling I-PER
, O
my O
first O
exploit O
in O
squirrel-shooting O
was O
in O
a O
grove O
of O
tall O
walnut-trees O
that O
shades O
one O
side O
of O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
. O
I O
had O
wandered O
into O
it O
at O
noontime O
, O
when O
all O
nature O
is O
peculiarly O
quiet O
, O
and O
was O
startled O
by O
the O
roar O
of O
my O
own O
gun O
, O
as O
it O
broke O
the O
Sabbath O
stillness O
around O
and O
was O
prolonged O
and O
reverberated O
by O
the O
angry O
echoes O
. O
If O
ever O
I O
should O
wish O
for O
a O
retreat O
whither O
I O
might O
steal O
from O
the B-LOC
world I-LOC
and O
its O
distractions O
, O
and O
dream O
quietly O
away O
the O
remnant O
of O
a O
troubled O
life O
, O
I O
know O
of O
none O
more O
promising O
than O
this B-LOC
little I-LOC
valley I-LOC

From O
the O
listless O
repose O
of O
the B-LOC
place I-LOC

and O
the O

character O
of O
its O

who O
are O
descendants O
from O
the B-PER
original I-PER
Dutch I-PER
settlers I-PER
, O
this B-LOC
sequestered I-LOC
glen I-LOC
has O
long O
been O
known O
by O
the O
name O
of O
SLEEPY B-LOC
HOLLOW I-LOC

called O

A O
drowsy O

seems O
to O
hang O
over O
the O

to O
pervade O
the O

Some O
say O
that O
the B-LOC

bewitched O
by O
a B-PER
High I-PER
German I-PER
doctor I-PER
, O
during O
the O
early O

before O

discovered O
by O
Master B-PER
Hendrick O

Certain O
it O
is O
, O
the B-LOC
place I-LOC
still O
continues O
under O
the O
sway O
of O
some O
witching O
power O
, O
that O
holds O
a O
spell O
over O
the O
minds O
of O
the B-PER
good I-PER
people I-PER
, O
causing O
them O
to O
walk O
in O
a O
continual O
reverie O

They O
are O
given O
to O
all O
kinds O
of O
marvellous O

are O
subject O
to O
trances O

frequently O

The B-FAC
whole I-FAC

abounds O
with O
local O

twilight O

oftener O
across O

in O
any O

and O
the O

with O
her O
whole O

seems O
to O
make O

the O

The O

that O

seems O
to O
be O
commander-in-chief O
of O
all O
the O
powers O
of O
the O

, O
is O
the O
apparition O
of O
a B-PER
figure I-PER
on I-PER
horseback I-PER
, I-PER
without I-PER
a I-PER
head I-PER
. O
It O
is O
said O
by O
some O
to O
be O
the O
ghost O
of O
a O
Hessian O
trooper O
, O
whose O
head O
had O
been O
carried O
away O
by O
a O
cannon-ball O
, O
in O
some O
nameless O
battle O
during O
the O
Revolutionary O
War O
, O
and O
who O
is O
ever O
and O
anon O
seen O
by O
the B-PER
country I-PER
folk I-PER
hurrying O
along O
in O
the O
gloom O
of O
night O
, O
as O
if O
on O
the O
wings O
of O
the O

. O
His O
haunts O
are O
not O
confined O
to O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC
, O
but O
extend O
at O
times O
to O
the B-FAC
adjacent I-FAC
roads I-FAC
, O
and O
especially O
to O
the O
vicinity O
of O
a B-FAC
church I-FAC
at O
no O
great O
distance O
. O
Indeed O
, O
certain O
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
historians O
of O
those B-LOC
parts I-LOC
, O
who O
have O
been O
careful O
in O
collecting O
and O
collating O
the O
floating O
facts O
concerning O
this B-PER
spectre I-PER
, O
allege O
that O
the O
body O
of O
the B-PER
trooper I-PER
having O
been O
buried O
in O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
, O
the B-PER
ghost I-PER
rides O
forth O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
battle O
in O
nightly O
quest O
of O
his O
head O
, O
and O
that O
the O
rushing O
speed O
with O
which O
he O
sometimes O
passes O
along O
the B-LOC
Hollow I-LOC
, O
like O
a O
midnight O
blast O
, O
is O
owing O
to O
his O
being O
belated O
, O
and O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the B-FAC
churchyard I-FAC
before O
daybreak O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
general O
purport O
of O
this O
legendary O
superstition O
, O
which O
has O
furnished O
materials O
for O
many O
a O
wild O
story O
in O
that B-LOC
region I-LOC
of I-LOC
shadows I-LOC
; O
and O
the B-PER
spectre I-PER
is O
known O
at O
all O
the O
country O
firesides O
, O
by O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Headless O
Horseman O
of O
Sleepy B-LOC
Hollow I-LOC

It O
is O
remarkable O
that O
the O
visionary O
propensity O
I O
have O
mentioned O
is O
not O
confined O
to O
the O
native O
inhabitants O
of O
the B-LOC
valley I-LOC

but O
is O
unconsciously O
imbibed O
by O
every O
one O
who O
resides O
there B-LOC
for O
a O
time O
. O
However O
wide O
awake O
they O
may O
have O
been O
before O
they O
entered O
that B-LOC
sleepy I-LOC
region I-LOC
, O
they O
are O
sure O
, O
in O
a O
little O
time O
, O
to O
inhale O
the O
witching O
influence O
of O
the O
air O
, O
and O
begin O
to O
grow O
imaginative O
, O
to O
dream O
dreams O
, O
and O
see O
apparitions O

I O
mention O
this B-LOC
peaceful I-LOC
spot I-LOC
with O
all O
possible O
laud O
, O
for O
it O
is O
in O
such O
little O
retired O
Dutch O

, O
found O
here O
and O
there O
embosomed O
in O
the B-GPE
great I-GPE
State I-GPE
of I-GPE
New I-GPE

, O
that O
population O

remain O
fixed O
, O
while O
the O
great O
torrent O
of O
migration O
and O
improvement O
, O
which O
is O
making O
such O
incessant O
changes O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
this B-GPE
restless I-GPE
country I-GPE
, O
sweeps O
by O
them O
unobserved O
. O
They O
are O
like O
those O
little O
nooks O
of O
still O
water O
, O
which O
border O
a B-LOC
rapid I-LOC
stream I-LOC
, O
where O
we O
may O
see O
the O
straw O

riding O
quietly O
at O

or O
slowly O
revolving O
in O
their O
mimic O
harbor O

undisturbed O
by O
the O

Though O
many O
years O
have O
elapsed O
since O
I O
trod O
the O
drowsy O
shades O
of O
Sleepy B-LOC
Hollow I-LOC

yet O
I O
question O
whether O
I O
should O
not O
still O
find O
the O
same O
trees O
and O
the O
same O
families O
vegetating O
in O
its O
sheltered O
bosom O
. O
In O
this O
by-place O
of O
nature O
there O
abode O
, O
in O
a O
remote O
period O
of O
American O
history O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
some O
thirty O
years O
since O
, O
a O
worthy O
wight O
of O
the O
name O
of O
Ichabod B-PER
Crane I-PER
, O
who O
sojourned O
, O
or O
, O
as O
he O
expressed O
it O
, O
“ O
tarried O
, O
” O
in O
Sleepy B-LOC
Hollow I-LOC
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
instructing O
the O
children O
of O
the B-LOC
vicinity I-LOC
. O
He O
was O
a O
native O
of O
Connecticut B-GPE
, O
a O
State O
which O
supplies O
the B-GPE
Union I-GPE
with O
pioneers B-PER
for I-PER
the I-PER
mind I-PER
as O
well O
as O
for O
the B-LOC
forest I-LOC
, O
and O
sends O
forth O
yearly O
its O
legions O
of O
frontier B-PER
woodmen I-PER
and O
country B-PER
schoolmasters I-PER
. O
The O
cognomen O
of O
Crane B-PER
was O
not O
inapplicable O
to O
his B-PER
person I-PER
. O
He O
was O
tall O
, O
but O
exceedingly O
lank O
, O
with O
narrow O
shoulders O
, O
long O
arms O
and O
legs O
, O
hands O
that O
dangled O
a O
mile O
out O
of O
his O
sleeves O
, O
feet O
that O
might O
have O
served O
for O
shovels O
, O
and O
his O
whole O
frame O
most O
loosely O
hung O
together O
. O
His O
head O
was O
small O
, O
and O
flat O
at O
top O
, O
with O
huge O
ears O
, O
large O
green O
glassy O
eyes O
, O
and O
a O
long O
snipe O
nose O
, O
so O
that O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
weather-cock O
perched O
upon O
his O
spindle O
neck O
to O
tell O
which O
way O
the O
wind O
blew O
. O
To O
see O
him O
striding O
along O
the O
profile O
of O
a B-LOC
hill I-LOC
on O
a O
windy O
day O
, O
with O
his O
clothes O
bagging O
and O
fluttering O
about O
him O
, O
one O
might O
have O
mistaken O
him O
for O
the O
genius O
of O
famine O
descending O
upon O
the B-LOC
earth I-LOC
, O
or O
some O
scarecrow O
eloped O
from O
a B-LOC
cornfield I-LOC
. O
His B-FAC
schoolhouse I-FAC
was O
a O
low O
building O
of O
one B-FAC
large I-FAC
room I-FAC
, O
rudely O
constructed O
of O
logs O
; O
the O
windows O
partly O
glazed O
, O
and O
partly O
patched O
with O
leaves O
of O
old O
copybooks O
. O
It O
was O
most O
ingeniously O
secured O
at O
vacant O
hours O
, O
by O
a O
withe O
twisted O
in O
the O
handle O
of O
the O
door O
, O
and O
stakes O
set O
against O
the O
window O
shutters O
; O
so O
that O
though O
a B-PER
thief I-PER
might O
get O
in O
with O
perfect O
ease O
, O
he O
would O
find O
some O
embarrassment O
in O
getting O
out O
, O
-- O
an O
idea O
most O
probably O
borrowed O
by O
the B-PER
architect I-PER
, O
Yost B-PER
Van I-PER
Houten I-PER
, O
from O
the O
mystery O
of O
an O
eelpot O
. O
The B-FAC
schoolhouse I-FAC
stood O
in O
a O
rather O
lonely O
but O
pleasant O
situation O
, O
just O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a B-LOC
woody I-LOC
hill I-LOC
, O
with O
a B-LOC
brook I-LOC
running O
close O
by O
, O
and O
a O
formidable O
birch-tree O
growing O
at O
one O
end O
of O
it O
. O
From O
hence O
the O
low O
murmur O
of O
his B-PER
pupils I-PER
’ O
voices O
, O
conning O
over O
their O
lessons O
, O
might O
be O
heard O
in O
a O
drowsy O
summer O
’s O
day O
, O
like O
the O
hum O
of O
a O
beehive O
; O
interrupted O
now O
and O
then O
by O
the O
authoritative O
voice O
of O
the B-PER
master I-PER
, O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
menace O
or O
command O
, O
or O
, O
peradventure O
, O
by O
the O
appalling O
sound O
of O
the O
birch O
, O
as O
he O
urged O
some B-PER
tardy I-PER
loiterer I-PER
along O
the O
flowery O
path O
of O
knowledge O
. O
Truth O
to O
say O
, O
he O
was O
a B-PER
conscientious I-PER
man I-PER
, O
and O
ever O
bore O
in O
mind O
the O
golden O
maxim O
, O
“ O
Spare O
the O
rod O
and O
spoil O
the B-PER
child I-PER
. O
” O
Ichabod B-PER
Crane I-PER
’s O
scholars O
certainly O
were O
not O
spoiled O
. O
I O
would O
not O
have O
it O
imagined O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
was O
one O
of O
those O
cruel O
potentates O
of O
the B-ORG
school I-ORG
who O
joy O
in O
the O
smart O
of O
their B-PER
subjects I-PER
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
administered O
justice O
with O
discrimination O
rather O
than O
severity O
; O
taking O
the O
burden O
off O
the O
backs O
of O
the B-PER
weak I-PER
, O
and O
laying O
it O
on O
those O
of O
the B-PER
strong I-PER
. O
Your B-PER
mere I-PER
puny I-PER
stripling I-PER
, I-PER
that I-PER
winced I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
least I-PER
flourish I-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
rod I-PER
, O
was O
passed O
by O
with O
indulgence O
; O
but O
the O
claims O
of O
justice O
were O
satisfied O
by O
inflicting O
a O
double O
portion O
on O
some B-PER
little I-PER
tough I-PER
wrong-headed I-PER
, I-PER
broad-skirted I-PER
Dutch I-PER
urchin I-PER
, I-PER
who I-PER
sulked I-PER
and I-PER
swelled I-PER
and I-PER
grew I-PER
dogged I-PER
and I-PER
sullen I-PER
beneath I-PER
the I-PER
birch I-PER
. O
All O
this O
he O
called O
“ O
doing O
his O
duty O
by O
their B-PER
parents I-PER
; O
” O
and O
he O
never O
inflicted O
a O
chastisement O
without O
following O
it O
by O
the O
assurance O
, O
so O
consolatory O
to O
the B-PER
smarting I-PER
urchin I-PER
, O
that O
“ O
he O
would O
remember O
it O

him O

the O
longest O

had O
to O

” O
When O
school O

over O

he O
was O
even O
the O
companion O

of O
the B-PER

on O

Indeed O
, O
it O
behooved O
him O
to O
keep O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
his B-PER
pupils I-PER
. O
The O
revenue O
arising O
from O
his B-ORG
school I-ORG
was O
small O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
scarcely O
sufficient O
to O
furnish O
him O
with O
daily O
bread O
, O
for O
he O
was O
a O
huge O
feeder O
, O
and O
, O
though O
lank O
, O
had O
the O
dilating O
powers O
of O
an O
anaconda O
; O
but O
to O
help O
out O
his O
maintenance O
, O
he O
was O
, O
according O
to O
country O
custom O
in O
those O
parts O
, O
boarded O
and O
lodged O
at O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
farmers O
whose O
children B-PER
he O
instructed O
. O
With O
these O
he O
lived O
successively O
a O
week O
at O
a O
time O
, O
thus O
going O
the O
rounds O
of O
the B-FAC
neighborhood I-FAC
, O
with O
all O
his O
worldly O
effects O
tied O
up O
in O
a O
cotton O
handkerchief O

That O
all O
this O
might O
not O
be O
too O
onerous O
on O
the O
purses O
of O
his O
rustic O
patrons O
, O
who O
are O

the O
costs O

schoolmasters B-PER

mere B-PER
drones I-PER
, O
he O
had O
various O
ways O
of O
rendering O
himself O
both O
useful O
and O
agreeable O
. O
He O
assisted O
the B-PER
farmers I-PER
occasionally O
in O
the O
lighter O
labors O
of O
their B-FAC
farms I-FAC
, O
helped O
to O
make O
hay O
, O
mended O
the O

took O
the O

drove O
the O

cut O

He O
laid O
aside O

too O
, O
all O
the O
dominant O
dignity O

absolute O
sway O
with O
which O
he O
lorded O
it O
in O
his B-FAC
little I-FAC
empire I-FAC
, O
the B-FAC
school I-FAC
, O
and O
became O
wonderfully O
gentle O
and O
ingratiating O
. O
He O
found O
favor O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the B-PER
mothers I-PER
by O
petting O
the B-PER
children I-PER
, O
particularly O
the O

like O
the O
lion O

, O
which O
whilom O
so O
magnanimously O
the O
lamb O

he O
would O
sit O
