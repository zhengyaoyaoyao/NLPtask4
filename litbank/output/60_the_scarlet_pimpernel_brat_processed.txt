CHAPTER O
I O
PARIS B-GPE
: O
SEPTEMBER O
, O
1792 O
A O
surging O
, O
seething O
, O
murmuring O
crowd O
of O
beings O
that O
are O
human O
only O
in O
name O
, O
for O
to O
the O
eye O
and O
ear O
they O
seem O
naught O
but O
savage B-PER
creatures I-PER
, O
animated O
by O
vile O
passions O
and O
by O
the O
lust O
of O
vengeance O
and O
of O
hate O
. O
The O
hour O
, O
some O
little O
time O
before O
sunset O
, O
and O
the O
place O
, O
the O
West O
Barricade O
, O
at O
the O
very O
spot O
where O
, O
a O
decade O
later O
, O
a B-PER
proud I-PER
tyrant I-PER
raised O
an O
undying O
monument O
to O
the O
nation O
's O
glory O
and O
his O
own O
vanity O
. O
During O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
day O
the O
guillotine O
had O
been O
kept O
busy O
at O
its O
ghastly O
work O
: O
all O
that O
France B-GPE
had O
boasted O
of O
in O
the O
past O
centuries O
, O
of O
ancient O
names O
, O
and O
blue O
blood O
, O
had O
paid O
toll O
to O
her O
desire O
for O
liberty O
and O
for O
fraternity O
. O
The O
carnage O
had O
only O
ceased O
at O
this O
late O
hour O
of O
the O
day O
because O
there O
were O
other O
more O
interesting O
sights O
for O
the B-PER
people I-PER
to O
witness O
, O
a O
little O
while O
before O
the O
final O
closing O
of O
the O
barricades O
for O
the O
night O
. O
And O
so O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
rushed O
away O
from O
the B-FAC
Place I-FAC
de I-FAC
la I-FAC
Greve I-FAC
and O
made O
for O
the O
various O
barricades O
in O
order O
to O
watch O
this O
interesting O
and O
amusing O
sight O
. O
It O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
every O
day O
, O
for O
those B-PER
aristos I-PER
were O
such B-PER
fools I-PER
! O
They O
were O
traitors O
to O
the B-PER
people I-PER
of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
them O
, O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
, O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
descendants O
of O
the O
great O
men O
who O
since O
the O
Crusades O
had O
made O
the O
glory O
of O
France B-GPE
: O
her B-PER
old I-PER
NOBLESSE I-PER
. O
Their B-PER
ancestors I-PER
had O
oppressed O
the B-PER
people I-PER
, O
had O
crushed O
them O
under O
the O
scarlet O
heels O
of O
their O
dainty O
buckled O
shoes O
, O
and O
now O
the B-PER
people I-PER
had O
become O
the O
rulers O
of O
France B-GPE
and O
crushed O
their B-PER
former I-PER
masters I-PER
-- O
not O
beneath O
their O
heel O
, O
for O
they O
went O
shoeless O
mostly O
in O
these O
days O
-- O
but O
a O
more O
effectual O
weight O
, O
the O
knife O
of O
the O
guillotine O
. O
And O
daily O
, O
hourly O
, O
the O
hideous O
instrument O
of O
torture O
claimed O
its B-PER
many I-PER
victims I-PER
-- O
old B-PER
men I-PER
, O
young B-PER
women I-PER
, O
tiny B-PER
children I-PER
until O
the O
day O
when O
it O
would O
finally O
demand O
the O
head O
of O
a B-PER
King I-PER
and O
of O
a B-PER
beautiful I-PER
young I-PER
Queen I-PER
. O
But O
this O
was O
as O
it O
should O
be O
: O
were O
not O
the B-PER
people I-PER
now O
the O
rulers O
of O
France B-GPE
? O
Every B-PER
aristocrat I-PER
was O
a B-PER
traitor I-PER
, O
as O
his B-PER
ancestors I-PER
had O
been O
before O
him O
: O
for O
two O
hundred O
years O
now O
the B-PER
people I-PER
had O
sweated O
, O
and O
toiled O
, O
and O
starved O
, O
to O
keep O
a O
lustful O
court O
in O
lavish O
extravagance O
; O
now O
the O
descendants O
of O
those B-PER
who I-PER
had I-PER
helped I-PER
to I-PER
make I-PER
those I-PER
courts I-PER
brilliant I-PER
had O
to O
hide O
for O
their O
lives O
-- O
to O
fly O
, O
if O
they O
wished O
to O
avoid O
the O
tardy O
vengeance O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
. O
And O
they O
did O
try O
to O
hide O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
fly O
: O
that O
was O
just O
the O
fun O
of O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O
Every O
afternoon O
before O
the O
gates O
closed O
and O
the B-VEH
market I-VEH
carts I-VEH
went O
out O
in O
procession O
by O
the O
various O
barricades O
, O
some O
fool O
of O
an B-PER
aristo I-PER
endeavoured O
to O
evade O
the O
clutches O
of O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
. O
In O
various O
disguises O
, O
under O
various O
pretexts O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
slip O
through O
the O
barriers O
, O
which O
were O
so O
well O
guarded O
by O
citizen O
soldiers O
of O
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
. O
Men O
in O
women B-PER
's O
clothes O
, O
women B-PER
in I-PER
male I-PER
attire I-PER
, O
children O
disguised O
in O
beggars B-PER
' O
rags O
: O
there O
were O
some O
of O
all O
sorts O
: O
CI-DEVANT O
counts O
, O
marquises O
, O
even O
dukes O
, O
who O
wanted O
to O
fly O
from O
France B-GPE
, O
reach O
England B-GPE
or O
some O
other O
equally O
accursed O
country O
, O
and O
there O
try O
to O
rouse O
foreign O
feelings O
against O
the O
glorious O
Revolution O
, O
or O
to O
raise O
an B-PER
army I-PER
in O
order O
to O
liberate O
the O
wretched O
prisoners O
in O
the B-FAC
Temple I-FAC
, O
who O
had O
once O
called O
themselves O
sovereigns O
of O
France B-GPE
. O
But O
they O
were O
nearly O
always O
caught O
at O
the O
barricades O
, O
Sergeant B-PER
Bibot O
especially O
at O
the B-FAC
West I-FAC
Gate I-FAC
had O
a O
wonderful O
nose O
for O
scenting O
an B-PER
aristo I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
most I-PER
perfect I-PER
disguise I-PER
. O
Then O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
fun O
began O
. O
Bibot B-PER
would O
look O
at O
his B-PER
prey I-PER
as O
a O
cat O
looks O
upon O
the O
mouse O
, O
play O
with O
him O
, O
sometimes O
for O
quite O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
pretend O
to O
be O
hoodwinked O
by O
the O
disguise O
, O
by O
the O
wigs O
and O
other O
bits O
of O
theatrical O
make-up O
which O
hid O
the O
identity O
of O
a B-PER
CI-DEVANT I-PER
noble I-PER
marquise I-PER
or I-PER
count I-PER
. O
Oh O
! O
Bibot B-PER
had O
a O
keen O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
and O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
hanging O
round O
that O
West O
Barricade O
, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
him O
catch O
an B-PER
aristo I-PER
in O
the O
very O
act O
of O
trying O
to O
flee O
from O
the O
vengeance O
of O
the B-PER
people I-PER
. O
Sometimes O
Bibot B-PER
would O
let O
his B-PER
prey I-PER
actually O
out O
by O
the O
gates O
, O
allowing O
him O
to O
think O
for O
the O
space O
of O
two O
minutes O
at O
least O
that O
he O
really O
had O
escaped O
out O
of O
Paris B-GPE
, O
and O
might O
even O
manage O
to O
reach O
the B-LOC
coast I-LOC
of O
England B-GPE
in O
safety O
, O
but O
Bibot B-PER
would O
let O
the B-PER
unfortunate I-PER
wretch I-PER
walk O
about O
ten O
metres O
towards O
the B-LOC
open I-LOC
country I-LOC
, O
then O
he O
would O
send O
two B-PER
men I-PER
after O
him O
and O
bring O
him O
back O
, O
stripped O
of O
his O
disguise O
. O
Oh O
! O
that O
was O
extremely O
funny O
, O
for O
as O
often O
as O
not O
the B-PER
fugitive I-PER
would O
prove O
to O
be O
a B-PER
woman I-PER
, O
some O
proud O
marchioness O
, O
who O
looked O
terribly O
comical O
when O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
Bibot B-PER
's O
clutches O
after O
all O
, O
and O
knew O
that O
a O
summary O
trial O
would O
await O
her O
the O
next O
day O
and O
after O
that O
, O
the O
fond O
embrace O
of O
Madame O
la O
Guillotine O
. O
No O
wonder O
that O
on O
this O
fine O
afternoon O
in O
September O
the O
crowd O
round O
Bibot B-PER
's O
gate O
was O
eager O
and O
excited O
. O
The O
lust O
of O
blood O
grows O
with O
its O
satisfaction O
, O
there O
is O
no O
satiety O
: O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
had O
seen O
a O
hundred O
noble O
heads O
fall O
beneath O
the O
guillotine O
to-day O
, O
it O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
would O
see O
another B-PER
hundred I-PER
fall O
on O
the O
morrow O
. O
Bibot B-PER
was O
sitting O
on O
an O
overturned O
and O
empty O
cask O
close O
by O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
barricade O
; O
a O
small O
detachment O
of O
citoyen B-PER
soldiers I-PER
was O
under O
his O
command O
. O
The O
work O
had O
been O
very O
hot O
lately O
. O
Those B-PER
cursed I-PER
aristos I-PER
were O
becoming O
terrified O
and O
tried O
their O
hardest O
to O
slip O
out O
of O
Paris B-GPE
: O
men O
, O
women O
and O
children O
, O
whose O
ancestors B-PER
, O
even O
in O
remote O
ages O
, O
had O
served O
those B-PER
traitorous I-PER
Bourbons I-PER
, O
were O
all O
traitors B-PER
themselves O
and O
right O
food O
for O
the O
guillotine O
. O
Every O
day O
Bibot B-PER
had O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
unmasking O
some B-PER
fugitive I-PER
royalists I-PER
and O
sending O
them O
back O
to O
be O
tried O
by O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
, O
presided O
over O
by O
that B-PER
good I-PER
patriot I-PER
, O
Citoyen B-PER
Foucquier-Tinville I-PER
. O
Robespierre B-PER
and O
Danton B-PER
both O
had O
commended O
Bibot B-PER
for O
his O
zeal O
and O
Bibot B-PER
was O
proud O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
on O
his O
own O
initiative O
had O
sent O
at B-PER
least I-PER
fifty I-PER
aristos I-PER
to O
the O
guillotine O
. O
But O
to-day O
all B-PER
the I-PER
sergeants I-PER
in I-PER
command I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
various I-PER
barricades I-PER
had O
had O
special O
orders O
. O
Recently O
a O
very O
great O
number O
of O
aristos B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
escaping O
out O
of O
France B-GPE
and O
in O
reaching O
England B-GPE
safely O
. O
There O
were O
curious O
rumours O
about O
these O
escapes O
; O
they O
had O
become O
very O
frequent O
and O
singularly O
daring O
; O
the B-PER
people I-PER
's O
minds O
were O
becoming O
strangely O
excited O
about O
it O
all O
. O
Sergeant B-PER
Grospierre O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
guillotine O
for O
allowing O
a B-PER
whole I-PER
family I-PER
of I-PER
aristos I-PER
to O
slip O
out O
of O
the O
North O
Gate O
under O
his O
very O
nose O
. O
It O
was O
asserted O
that O
these O
escapes O
were O
organised O
by O
a O
band O
of O
Englishmen O
, O
whose O
daring O
seemed O
to O
be O
unparalleled O
, O
and O
who O
, O
from O
sheer O
desire O
to O
meddle O
in O
what O
did O
not O
concern O
them O
, O
spent O
their O
spare O
time O
in O
snatching O
away O
lawful B-PER
victims I-PER
destined I-PER
for I-PER
Madame I-PER
la I-PER
Guillotine I-PER
. O
These O
rumours O
soon O
grew O
in O
extravagance O
; O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
this B-PER
band I-PER
of I-PER
meddlesome I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
did O
exist O
; O
moreover O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
a B-PER
man I-PER
whose I-PER
pluck I-PER
and I-PER
audacity I-PER
were I-PER
almost I-PER
fabulous I-PER
. O
Strange O
stories O
were O
afloat O
of O
how O
he O
and O
those B-PER
aristos I-PER
whom I-PER
he I-PER
rescued I-PER
became O
suddenly O
invisible O
as O
they O
reached O
the O
barricades O
and O
escaped O
out O
of O
the O
gates O
by O
sheer O
supernatural O
agency O
. O
No B-PER
one I-PER
had O
seen O
these B-PER
mysterious I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
; O
as O
for O
their B-PER
leader I-PER
, O
he O
was O
never O
spoken O
of O
, O
save O
with O
a O
superstitious O
shudder O
. O
Citoyen B-PER
Foucquier-Tinville I-PER
would O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
receive O
a O
scrap O
of O
paper O
from O
some O
mysterious O
source O
; O
sometimes O
he O
would O
find O
it O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
at O
others O
it O
would O
be O
handed O
to O
him O
by O
someone O
in O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
, O
whilst O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
sitting O
of O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
. O
The O
paper O
always O
contained O
a O
brief O
notice O
that O
the B-PER
band I-PER
of I-PER
meddlesome I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
were O
at O
work O
, O
and O
it O
was O
always O
signed O
with O
a O
device O
drawn O
in O
red O
-- O
a O
little O
star-shaped O
flower O
, O
which O
we O
in O
England B-GPE
call O
the O
Scarlet O
Pimpernel O
. O
Within O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
the O
receipt O
of O
this O
impudent O
notice O
, O
the O
citoyens O
of O
the B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Safety I-ORG
would O
hear O
that O
so B-PER
many I-PER
royalists I-PER
and I-PER
aristocrats I-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
reaching O
the B-LOC
coast I-LOC
, O
and O
were O
on O
their O
way O
to O
England B-GPE
and O
safety O
. O
The B-PER
guards I-PER
at I-PER
the I-PER
gates I-PER
had O
been O
doubled O
, O
the B-PER
sergeants I-PER
in I-PER
command I-PER
had O
been O
threatened O
with O
death O
, O
whilst O
liberal O
rewards O
were O
offered O
for O
the O
capture O
of O
these B-PER
daring I-PER
and I-PER
impudent I-PER
Englishmen I-PER
. O
There O
was O
a O
sum O
of O
five O
thousand O
francs O
promised O
to O
the O
man O
who O
laid O
hands O
on O
the B-PER
mysterious I-PER
and I-PER
elusive I-PER
Scarlet I-PER
Pimpernel I-PER
. O
Everyone B-PER
felt O
that O
Bibot B-PER
would O
be O
that B-PER
man I-PER
, O
and O
Bibot B-PER
allowed O
that O
belief O
to O
take O
firm O
root O
in O
everybody B-PER
's O
mind O
; O
and O
so O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
people B-PER
came O
to O
watch O
him O
at O
the B-FAC
West I-FAC
Gate I-FAC
, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
present O
when O
he O
laid O
hands O
on O
any O
fugitive O
aristo O
who O
perhaps O
might O
be O
accompanied O
by O
that B-PER
mysterious I-PER
Englishman I-PER
. O
“ O
Bah O
! O
” O
he O
said O
to O
his B-PER
trusted I-PER
corporal I-PER
, O
“ O
Citoyen B-PER
Grospierre I-PER
was O
a B-PER
fool I-PER
! O
Had O
it O
been O
me O
now O
, O
at O
that B-FAC
North I-FAC
Gate I-FAC
last O
week O
. O
. O
. O
” O
Citoyen B-PER
Bibot I-PER
spat O
on O
the O
ground O
to O
express O
his O
contempt O
for O
his B-PER
comrade I-PER
's O
stupidity O
. O
“ O
How O
did O
it O
happen O
, O
citoyen O
? O
” O
asked O
the B-PER
corporal I-PER
. O
“ O
Grospierre B-PER
was O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
keeping O
good O
watch O
, O
” O
began O
Bibot B-PER
, O
pompously O
, O
as O
the B-PER
crowd I-PER
closed O
in O
round O
him O
, O
listening O
eagerly O
to O
his O
narrative O
. O
“ O
We O
've O
all O
heard O
of O
this B-PER
meddlesome I-PER
Englishman I-PER
, O
this B-PER
accursed I-PER
Scarlet I-PER
Pimpernel I-PER
. O
He O
wo O
n't O
get O
through O
MY O
gate O
, O
MORBLEU O
! O
unless O
he O
be O
the B-PER
devil I-PER
himself I-PER
. O
But O
Grospierre B-PER
was O
a B-PER
fool I-PER
. O
The B-VEH
market I-VEH
carts I-VEH
were O
going O
through O
the O
gates O
; O
there O
was O
one O
laden O
with O
casks O
, O
and O
driven O
by O
an B-PER
old I-PER
man I-PER
, O
with O
a B-PER
boy I-PER
beside I-PER
him I-PER
. O
Grospierre B-PER
was O
a O
bit O
drunk O
, O
but O
he O
thought O
himself O
very O
clever O
; O
he O
looked O
into O
the O
casks O
-- O
most O
of O
them O
