It O
was O
a O
feature O
peculiar O
to O
the O
colonial O
wars O
of O
North B-GPE
America I-GPE
, O
that O
the O
toils O
and O
dangers O
of O
the B-LOC
wilderness I-LOC
were O
to O
be O
encountered O
before O
the B-PER
adverse I-PER
hosts I-PER
could O
meet O
. O
A B-LOC
wide I-LOC
and I-LOC
apparently I-LOC
an I-LOC
impervious I-LOC
boundary I-LOC
of I-LOC
forests I-LOC
severed O
the O
possessions O
of O
the O
hostile O
provinces O

France B-GPE

England B-GPE

The B-PER
hardy I-PER

the B-PER
trained I-PER
European I-PER

his I-PER

the O

the B-LOC

in O
effecting O
the B-LOC
rugged I-LOC

in O
quest O
of O
an O
opportunity O
to O
exhibit O
their O
courage O
in O
a O
more O
martial O
conflict O

But O
, O
emulating O
the O
patience O
and O
self-denial O
of O
the B-PER
practiced I-PER
native I-PER
warriors I-PER
, O
they O
learned O
to O
overcome O
every O
difficulty O
; O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
, O
in O
time O
, O
there O
was O
no O
recess O
of O
the B-LOC
woods I-LOC
so O
dark O
, O
nor O
any O
secret O

so O
lovely O

that O
it O
might O
claim O
exemption O
from O
the O

of O
those O
who O
had O
pledged O
their O
blood O
to O
satiate O
their O
vengeance O
, O
or O
to O
uphold O
the O
cold O
and O
selfish O
policy O
of O
the O
distant O
monarchs O

Europe B-GPE

Perhaps O
no O
district O
throughout O
the O
wide O
extent O
of O
the B-LOC
intermediate I-LOC
frontiers I-LOC
can O
furnish O
a O
livelier O
picture O
of O
the O
cruelty O

fierceness O
of O
the O
savage O
warfare O
of O
those O

the O

which O
lies O
between O
the O

The O
facilities O
which O
nature B-PER

there B-LOC
offered O
to O
the O
march O
of O
the B-PER

were O
too O
obvious O

neglected O

The O
lengthened O
sheet O

the B-PER

stretched O
from O
the O

deep O
within O

the B-GPE

strike O
their B-PER

Near O
its B-PER
southern I-PER
termination I-PER
, O
it O
received O
the O
contributions O
of O
another O
lake O

whose O
waters O
were O
so O
limpid O
as O

been O
exclusively O
selected O
by O
the B-PER
Jesuit I-PER
missionaries I-PER
to O
perform O
the O
typical O
purification O

to O
obtain O
for O
it O
the O
title O
of O
lake B-LOC
“ I-LOC
du I-LOC
Saint I-LOC
Sacrement I-LOC

” I-LOC
The B-PER
less I-PER
zealous I-PER
English I-PER
thought O
they O
conferred O
a O
sufficient O
honor O
on O
its B-LOC
unsullied I-LOC
fountains I-LOC
, O
when O
they O
bestowed O
the O
name O
of O
their B-PER
reigning I-PER
prince I-PER
, O
the O
second O
of O
the O
house O
of O
Hanover B-GPE

The B-GPE
two I-GPE
united O
to O
rob O
the O
untutored O
possessors O
of O
its B-LOC
wooded I-LOC

of O
their O

its O
original O

As O
each O
nation O
of O
the B-PER
Indians I-PER
had O
its O
language O
or O
its O
dialect O
, O
they O
usually O
gave O
different O
names O
to O
the B-LOC

places I-LOC

though O
nearly O
all O
of O
their O
appellations O
were O
descriptive O
of O
the O

Thus O
a O
literal O
translation O
of O
the O
name O
of O
this B-LOC
beautiful I-LOC
sheet I-LOC
of I-LOC
water I-LOC
, O
used O
by O
the O
tribe O
that O

on O

it O

The O
imbecility O

abroad I-PER

and O
the O
fatal O
want O

At O

lay O
General B-PER
Webb O

who O
commanded O
the O
armies O
of O
the B-PER
king I-PER
in O
the O
northern O
provinces O

with O
a O
body O
of O
more B-PER
than I-PER
five I-PER
thousand I-PER
men I-PER

By O
uniting O
the B-ORG
several I-ORG
detachments I-ORG
of I-ORG
his I-ORG
command I-ORG
, O
this B-PER
officer I-PER
might O
have O
arrayed O
nearly O
double O
that O
number O
of O
combatants B-PER
against O
the O
enterprising O
Frenchman O
, O
who O
had O
ventured O
so O
far O
from O
his B-ORG
reinforcements I-ORG
, O
with O
an B-ORG
army I-ORG
but I-ORG
little I-ORG
superior I-ORG
in I-ORG
numbers I-ORG
. O
But O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
their O
degraded O
fortunes O
, O
both B-PER
officers I-PER
and O
men B-PER
appeared O
better O
disposed O
to O
await O
the O
approach O
of O
their B-PER
formidable I-PER
antagonists I-PER
, O
within O
their O
works O
, O
than O
to O
resist O
the O
progress O
of O
their O
march O

by O
emulating O
the O
successful O
example O
of O
the B-GPE
French I-GPE
at O
Fort B-GPE
du I-GPE
Quesne I-GPE

and O
striking O
a O

After O
the O
first O
surprise O
of O
the O
intelligence O
had O
a O
little O
abated O
, O
a O
rumor O
was O
spread O
through O
the O
entrenched O
camp O
, O
which O
stretched O
along O
the O
margin O
of O
the B-LOC
Hudson I-LOC
, O
forming O
a O
chain O
of O
outworks O
to O
the O
body O
of O
the B-FAC
fort I-FAC
itself O
, O
that O
a O
chosen O
detachment O
of O
fifteen B-PER
hundred I-PER
men I-PER
was O
to O
depart O

with O
the O

for O
William B-FAC

the O

at O
the O
northern O
extremity O
of O
the B-LOC
portage I-LOC

That O
which O
at O
first O
was O
only O
rumor O
, O
soon O
became O
certainty O
, O
as O
orders O
passed O
from O
the O
quarters O
of O
the B-PER
commander-in-chief I-PER
to O
the B-ORG
several I-ORG
corps I-ORG

had I-ORG
selected I-ORG
for I-ORG
this I-ORG
service I-ORG

to O
prepare O

speedy O
departure O

All O

the O
intention O

Webb B-PER
now O
vanished O

an O
hour O
or O
two O
of O
hurried O
footsteps O

anxious O
faces O
succeeded O

The B-PER
novice I-PER
in I-PER
the I-PER
military I-PER
art I-PER
flew O
from O
point O
to O
point O
, O
retarding O
his O
own O
preparations O
by O
the O
excess O
of O
his O
violent O
and O
somewhat O
distempered O
zeal O
; O
while O
the B-PER
more I-PER
practiced I-PER
veteran I-PER
made O
his O
arrangements O
with O
a O
deliberation O
that O
scorned O
every O
appearance O
of O
haste O
; O
though O
his O
sober O
lineaments O
and O
anxious O
eye O
sufficiently O
betrayed O
that O
he O
had O
no O
very O
strong O
professional O
relish O
for O
the O
, O
as O
yet O
, O
untried O
and O
dreaded O
warfare O
of O
the B-LOC
wilderness I-LOC

At O
length O
the O
sun O
set O
in O
a O
flood O
of O
glory O
, O
behind O
the B-LOC
distant I-LOC
western I-LOC
hills I-LOC
, O
and O
as O
darkness O
drew O
its O
veil O
around O
the B-LOC
secluded I-LOC
spot I-LOC
the O
sounds O
of O
preparation O
diminished O
; O
the O
last O
light O
finally O
disappeared O
from O
the O
log O
cabin O
of O
some B-PER
officer I-PER
; O
the O
trees O
cast O
their O
deeper O
shadows O
over O
the O
mounds O
and O
the O
rippling O
stream O
, O
and O
a O
silence O
soon O
pervaded O
the B-FAC
camp I-FAC
, O
as O
deep O
as O
that O
which O
reigned O
in O
the B-LOC
vast I-LOC
forest I-LOC

it O
